The '''AeroVironment Global Observer''' is a concept for a high-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], designed by [[AeroVironment]] (AV) to operate as a stratospheric [[geosynchronous]] satellite system with regional coverage.&lt;ref name="did"&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/aerovironments-global-observer-flying-high-again-03902/ Defense Industry Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Global Observer aircraft, each flying for up to a week at an altitude of {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}}, could alternate coverage over any area on the earth, providing a platform for communications relays, remote sensing, or long-term surveillance. In addition to flying above weather and above other conventional aircraft, operation at this altitude permits communications and sensor payloads on the aircraft to service an area on the surface of the earth up to {{convert|600|mi|km}} in diameter, equivalent to more than {{convert|280000|sqmi|km2}} of coverage. Global Observer may offer greater flexibility than a satellite and longer duration than conventional manned and unmanned aircraft.&lt;ref name="did"/&gt;

==Development==

===JCTD program===
The Global Observer Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program had the goal of helping solve the capability gap in persistent ISR and communications relay for the [[US military]] and homeland security.  The Global Observer JCTD demonstrated a new stratospheric, extreme endurance UAS that could be transitioned for post-JCTD development, extended user evaluation, and fielding.  The program was a joint effort with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[Department of Homeland Security]], and AeroVironment that started in September 2007, to culminate in a Joint Operational Utility Assessment (JOUA) in 2011.

The program provided for the system development, production of two aircraft, development flight testing, and JOUA with ISR and communications relay payload.  The flight testing and JOUA was conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. The primary objectives of the Global Observer JCTD Program were:

*Develop enabling technologies for a liquid hydrogen powered Global Observer UAS.
*Design, build, and demonstrate the Global Observer UAS for a 5 - 7 day endurance for {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}} altitude missions with 380-pound, 2.8&amp;nbsp;kW payload capacity. The system had to be capable of being transported by a C-130 aircraft.
*Integrate and assess military utility of modular Global Observer payloads to address user identified gaps in ISR and communications relay.
*Evaluate system life cycle costs.

===JCTD sponsors===
*U.S. Department of Defense
*United States Special Operations Command
*United States Strategic Command
*U.S. Department of Homeland Security
*U.S. Air Force
*U.S. Army
*U.S. Coast Guard
*U.S. Defense Threat Reductions Agency

===Flight test partners===
*Air Force Flight Test Center
*NASA Dryden Flight Research Center

===Mission possibilities===
High-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, such as Global Observer, may enable several capabilities that enable rapid and effective actions or [[countermeasure]]s:
* '''Communications relay.'''  Durable, satellite-like, affordable communications relay with substantial bandwidth capacity can interconnect and route data in real time, enabling teams and command centers separated by topographical barriers to communicate with each other.
* '''Disaster response.''' Hurricane, storm tracking and general weather monitoring may be useful in evacuation planning, relief operations and first response coordination. Global Observer provides communication alternatives in the event of cell tower, microwave relay and satellite downlink failure.
* '''Maritime surveillance.''' Coastlines plagued by transport of illegal goods can be subject to long-term surveillance. Analysts can observe suspicious activity, determine patterns of behavior and identify threats.

==History==

A Global Observer prototype, called "Odyssey," flew in May 2005.  It had a {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}}, one-third the size of the planned full-sized version, and ran solely on hydrogen fuel-cells powering electric motors that drove eight propellers, flying the aircraft for several hours.  The JCTD started in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2005-11/aerovironment-global-observer AEROVIRONMENT GLOBAL OBERSVER] - Popsci.com, 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/aerovironment-global-observer-long-endurance-uav-wing-load-tests/16022/ AeroVironment Global Observer long endurance UAS completes wing load tests] - Gizmag.com, 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Aerovironment announced that the full-sized Global Observer wing had passed wing load testing.  The 53&amp;nbsp;m (175&amp;nbsp;ft) all-composite wing, which comes in five sections and is designed to maximize wing strength while minimizing weight, had loads applied to it that approximated the maximum loads it is designed to withstand during normal flight, turbulence and maneuvers.  In its third year of testing, the demonstrator had also undergone ground and taxi tests as well as taken a "short hop" lifting off the ground briefly during taxiing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/global-observer-clears-wing-load-testing-346040/ Global Observer clears wing load testing] - Flightglobal.com, 11 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"/&gt;

The Global Observer performed its first flight on 5 August 2010, taking off from Edwards AFB and reaching an altitude of {{convert|4,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for one hour.  The flight was performed using battery power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-first-flight/16049/ Global Observer successfully completes first flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;The aircraft completed initial flight testing, consisting of multiple low-altitude flights, at Edwards AFB in August and September 2010.  This phase used batteries to power the hybrid-electric aircraft and approximate full aircraft weight and center of gravity for flight control, performance, and responsiveness evaluation.  Following this, the program team installed and ground tested the aircraft's hydrogen-fueled generator and liquid hydrogen fuel tanks which will power it for up to a week in the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/AeroVironment_Global_Observer_Stratospheric_Unmanned_Aircraft_System_Completes_Initial_Flight_Testing_999.html AeroVironment Global Observer Stratospheric UAV Completes Initial Testing] - Spacedaily.com, 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flight of the Global Observer using hydrogen fuel occurred on 11 January 2011, reaching an altitude of {{convert|5,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-uav-first-hydrogen-powered-flight/17602/ Global Observer unmanned aircraft makes first hydrogen-powered flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2011, Global Observer-1 (GO-1), the first aircraft to be completed, crashed 18 hours into its 9th test flight.  AeroVironment said it was undergoing flight test envelope expansion and had been operating for nearly twice the endurance and at a higher altitude than previous flights when the crash occurred.  At the time, the second aircraft developed as part of the JCTD program was nearing completion at a company facility; the $140 million program was originally scheduled for completion in late 2011, but the crash delayed this by a year.  AeroVironment was looking for sources of incremental funding to provide a bridge between the demonstration and a future procurement program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-crash/18321/ Global Observer UAS crashes during flight-testing] - Gizmag.com, 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/aerovironment-global-observer-crash-rattles-observers-0 AeroVironment Global Observer Crash Rattles Observers] - Aviationweek.com, 1 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Observer crashes during test flight |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/04/04/Global-Observer-crashes-during-test-flight/UPI-41741301921265/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |agency=United Press International|date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Pentagon closed the development contract for the Global Observer, the reason being the crash in April 2011.  The Global Observer was used as a technology demonstration, not a program for a functioning aircraft.  In April 2013, the Pentagon stated that no service or defense agency had advocated for it to be a program.  AeroVironment is currently in possession of the second prototype Global Observer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/04/pentagon-global-observer/ No One Wants the Pentagon’s Gigantic Hydrogen-Powered Drone] Wired.com, April 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2014, AeroVironment announced that it had teamed with [[Lockheed Martin]] to sell the Global Observer to international customers.  The partnership is focused around building "atmospheric satellite systems" around the UAV.  The Global Observer may compete for orders with the [[Boeing]] [[Phantom Eye]] liquid hydrogen-powered long endurance UAV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/aerovironment-teams-with-lockheed-martin-on-global-observer-395675/ AeroVironment teams with Lockheed Martin on Global Observer] - Flightglobal.com, 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/2014-02-09/aerovironment-lockheed-martin-advance-global-observer-uas AeroVironment, Lockheed Martin Advance Global Observer UAS] - Ainonline.com, 9 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37065">The '''analytic–synthetic distinction''' (also called the '''analytic–synthetic dichotomy''') is a [[Semantics|semantic]] distinction, used primarily in [[philosophy]] to distinguish propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) into two types: '''analytic propositions''' and '''synthetic propositions'''. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref name=Rey/&gt; However, philosophers have used the terms in very different ways. Furthermore, philosophers have debated whether there is a legitimate distinction.

==Kant==
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

===Conceptual containment===
The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] uses the terms "analytic" and "synthetic" to divide propositions into two types. Kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the Introduction to his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781/1998, A6–7/B10–11). There, he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] judgments and defines "analytic proposition" and "synthetic proposition" as follows:
* '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is '''not''' contained in its subject concept but related

Examples of analytic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "All triangles have three sides."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are extended," that is, occupy space. (A7/B11)

Each of these statements is an affirmative subject-predicate judgment, and, in each, the predicate concept is ''contained'' within the subject concept. The concept "bachelor" contains the concept "unmarried"; the concept "unmarried" is part of the definition of the concept "bachelor". Likewise, for "triangle" and "has three sides", and so on.

Examples of synthetic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are alone."
* "All creatures with hearts have kidneys."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are heavy", that is, they experience a gravitational force. (A7/B11)

As with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions, each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment. However, in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept. The concept "bachelor" does not contain the concept "alone"; "alone" is not a part of the ''definition'' of "bachelor". The same is true for "creatures with hearts" and "have kidneys"; even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys, the concept "creature with a heart" does not contain the concept "has kidneys".

===Kant's version and the ''a priori''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''a posteriori'' distinction===
{{main|A priori and a posteriori}}
In the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction, the distinction between [[a priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] and [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] propositions. He defines these terms as follows:
* '''''a priori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does ''not'' rely upon experience. Moreover, the proposition can be validated by experience, but is not grounded in experience. Therefore, it is logically necessary.
* '''''a posteriori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does rely upon experience. The proposition is validated by, and grounded in, experience. Therefore, it is logically contingent.

Examples of ''a priori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "7 + 5 = 12."

The justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience: one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried, nor whether {{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}. (Of course, as Kant would grant, experience is required to understand the concepts "bachelor", "unmarried", "7", "+" and so forth. However, the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction as employed here by Kant refers not to the ''origins'' of the concepts but to the ''justification'' of the propositions. Once we have the concepts, experience is no longer necessary.)

Examples of ''a posteriori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unhappy."
* "Tables exist."

Both of these propositions are ''a posteriori'': any justification of them would require one's experience.

The analytic/synthetic distinction and the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction together yield four types of propositions:
# analytic ''a priori''
# synthetic ''a priori''
# analytic ''a posteriori''
# synthetic ''a posteriori''

Kant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory.  Ruling it out, he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological framework{{mdash}}each, for brevity's sake, becoming, respectively, "analytic", "synthetic a priori", and "empirical" or "a posteriori" propositions. This triad will account for all propositions possible.

===The ease of knowing analytic propositions===
Part of Kant's argument in the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' involves arguing that there is no problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible. To know an analytic proposition, Kant argued, one need not consult experience. Instead, one needs merely to take the subject and "extract from it, in accordance with the principle of contradiction, the required predicate" (A7/B12). In analytic propositions, the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept. Thus, to know an analytic proposition is true, one need merely examine the concept of the subject. If one finds the predicate contained in the subject, the judgment is true.

Thus, for example, one need not consult experience to determine whether "All bachelors are unmarried" is true. One need merely examine the subject concept ("bachelors") and see if the predicate concept "unmarried" is contained in it. And in fact, it is: "unmarried" is part of the definition of "bachelor" and so is contained within it. Thus the proposition "All bachelors are unmarried" can be known to be true without consulting experience.

It follows from this, Kant argued, first: All analytic propositions are ''a priori''; there are no ''a posteriori'' analytic propositions. It follows, second: There is no problem understanding how we can know analytic propositions;  we can know them because we only need to consult our concepts in order to determine that they are true.

===The possibility of metaphysics===
After ruling out the possibility of analytic ''a posteriori'' propositions, and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic ''a priori'' propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of synthetic ''a posteriori'' propositions. That leaves only the question of how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic ''a priori'' propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible.&lt;ref name=Langford1949&gt; See [[Cooper Harold Langford]] (1949)'s ostensive proof: {{cite journal|title= A Proof That Synthetic A Priori Propositions Exist|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|year= 1949 |volume= 46|number= 1| date= 1949-01-06|pages= 20–24 |jstor=2019526 |last1= Langford|first1= C. H.|authorlink1=Cooper Harold Langford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical positivists==

===Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition===
Over a hundred years later, a group of philosophers took interest in Kant and his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions: the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]].

Part of Kant's examination of the possibility of synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge involved the examination of mathematical propositions, such as
* "7 + 5 = 12." (B15–16)
* "The shortest distance between two points is a straight line." (B16–17)

Kant maintained that mathematical propositions such as these are synthetic ''a priori'' propositions, and that we know them. That they are synthetic, he thought, is obvious: the concept "equal to 12" is not contained within the concept "7 + 5";  and the concept "straight line" is not contained within the concept "the shortest distance between two points". From this, Kant concluded that we have knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions.

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s notion of analyticity included a number of logical properties and relations beyond containment: [[symmetry]], [[transitive relation|transitivity]], [[antonymy]], or [[negation]] and so on. He had a strong emphasis on formality, in particular formal definition, and also emphasized the idea of substitution of synonymous terms. "All bachelors are unmarried" can be expanded out with the formal definition of bachelor as "unmarried man" to form "All unmarried men are unmarried", which is recognizable as tautologous and therefore analytic from its logical form: any statement of the form "All ''X'' that are (''F'' and ''G'') are ''F''". Using this particular expanded idea of analyticity, Frege concluded that Kant's examples of arithmetical truths are analytical ''a priori'' truths and ''not'' synthetic ''a priori'' truths.

{{quote|1=Thanks to Frege's logical semantics, particularly his concept of analyticity, arithmetic truths like "7+5=12" are no longer synthetic ''a priori'' but analytical ''a priori'' truths in [[Carnap]]'s extended sense of "analytic".
Hence logical empiricists are not subject to Kant's criticism of Hume for throwing out mathematics along with metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;}}

(Here "logical empiricist" is a synonym for "logical positivist".)

===The origin of the logical positivist's distinction===
The logical positivists agreed with Kant that we have knowledge of mathematical truths, and further that mathematical propositions are ''a priori''. However, they did not believe that any complex metaphysics, such as the type Kant supplied, are necessary to explain our knowledge of mathematical truths. Instead, the logical positivists maintained that our knowledge of judgments like "all bachelors are unmarried" and our knowledge of mathematics (and logic) are in the basic sense the same: all proceeded from our knowledge of the meanings of terms or the conventions of language.

{{quote|Since empiricism had always asserted that ''all'' knowledge is based on experience, this assertion had to include knowledge in mathematics. On the other hand, we believed that with respect to this problem the rationalists had been right in rejecting the old empiricist view that the truth of "&lt;nowiki&gt;2+2=4&lt;/nowiki&gt;" is contingent on the observation of facts, a view that would lead to the unacceptable consequence that an arithmetical statement might possibly be refuted tomorrow by new experiences. Our solution, based upon [[Wittgenstein]]'s conception, consisted in asserting the thesis of empiricism only for factual truth. By contrast, the truths of logic and mathematics are not in need of confirmation by observations, because they do not state anything about the world of facts, they hold for any possible combination of facts.&lt;ref name=Schlipp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;|Rudolf Carnap|Autobiography: §10: Semantics, p. 64}}

===Logical positivist definitions===
Thus the logical positivists drew a new distinction, and, inheriting the terms from Kant, named it the "analytic/synthetic distinction".&lt;ref name=Ebbs/&gt; They provided many different definitions, such as the following:
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose truth depends solely on the meaning of its terms
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is true (or false) by definition
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is made true (or false) solely by the conventions of language

(While the logical positivists believed that the only necessarily true propositions were analytic, they did not define "analytic proposition" as "necessarily true proposition" or "proposition that is true in all possible worlds".)

Synthetic propositions were then defined as:
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition that is not analytic

These definitions applied to all propositions, regardless of whether they were of subject–predicate form. Thus, under these definitions, the proposition "It is raining or it is not raining" was classified as analytic, while for Kant it was analytic by virtue of its logical form. And the proposition "{{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}" was classified as analytic, while under Kant's definitions it was synthetic.

==Two-dimensionalism==
[[Two-dimensionalism]] is an approach to [[semantics]] in [[analytic philosophy]]. It is a theory of how to determine the [[sense and reference]] of a [[word]] and the [[truth-value]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. It is intended to resolve a puzzle that has plagued philosophy for some time, namely: How is it possible to discover empirically that a [[necessary truth]] is [[Truth|true]]? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by [[Robert Stalnaker]], but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including [[David Chalmers]] and [[Berit Brogaard]].

Any given sentence, for example, the words,
:"Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O"

is taken to express two distinct [[proposition]]s, often referred to as a ''primary intension'' and a ''secondary intension'', which together compose its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;

The primary [[intension]] of a word or sentence is its [[sense and reference|sense]], i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of "water" might be a description, such as ''watery stuff''. The thing picked out by the primary intension of "water" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take "water" to mean ''watery stuff'', but, where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, it is not the case that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for that world.

The ''secondary intension'' of "water" is whatever thing "water" happens to pick out in ''this'' world, whatever that world happens to be. So if we assign "water" the primary intension ''watery stuff'' then the secondary intension of "water" is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, since H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is ''watery stuff'' in this world. The secondary intension of "water" in our world is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in every world because unlike ''watery stuff'' it is impossible for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be other than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. When considered according to its secondary intension, "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is true in every world.

If two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language. [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is an example of the ''[[necessary truth|necessary]] [[a posteriori]]'', since we had to discover that water was H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but given that it is true, it cannot be false. It would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, for these are known to be ''identical''.

==Quine's criticisms==
{{See also|Willard Van Orman Quine#Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity}}
[[Rudolf Carnap]] was a strong proponent of the distinction between what he called "internal questions", questions entertained within a "framework" (like a mathematical theory), and "external questions", questions posed outside any framework&amp;nbsp;– posed before the adoption of any framework.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Murzi/&gt; The "internal" questions could be of two types: ''logical'' (or analytic, or logically true) and ''factual'' (empirical, that is, matters of observation interpreted using terms from a framework). The "external" questions were also of two types: those that were confused pseudo-questions ("one disguised in the form of a theoretical question") and those that could be re-interpreted as practical, pragmatic questions about whether a framework under consideration was "more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended".&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; The adjective "synthetic" was not used by Carnap in his 1950 work ''Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology''.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; Carnap did define a "synthetic truth" in his work ''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'': a sentence that is true, but not simply because "the semantical rules of the system suffice for establishing its truth".&lt;ref name=Carnap2/&gt;

The notion of a synthetic truth is of something that is true both because of what it means and because of the way the world is, whereas analytic truths are true in virtue of meaning alone. Thus, what Carnap calls internal ''factual'' statements (as opposed to internal ''logical'' statements) could be taken as being also synthetic truths because they require ''observations'', but some external statements also could be "synthetic" statements and Carnap would be doubtful about their status. The analytic–synthetic argument therefore is not identical with the [[internal–external distinction]].&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt;

In 1951, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published the essay "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" in which he argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is untenable.&lt;ref name=Dogmas/&gt; The argument at bottom is that there are no "analytic" truths, but all truths involve an empirical aspect. In the first paragraph, Quine takes the distinction to be the following:
* analytic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in meanings, independent of matters of fact.
* synthetic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in fact.

Quine's position denying the analytic-synthetic distinction is summarized as follows:
{{quote|It is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic fact. ... Thus one is tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component. Given this supposition, it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null; and these are the analytic statements. But, for all its ''a priori'' reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.&lt;ref name=Quine4/&gt;|Willard v. O. Quine|"Two Dogmas of Empiricism", p. 64}}

To summarize Quine's argument, the notion of an analytic proposition requires a notion of synonymy, but establishing synonymy inevitably leads to matters of fact&amp;nbsp;– synthetic propositions. Thus, there is no non-circular (and so no tenable) way to ground the notion of analytic propositions.

While Quine's rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction is widely known, the precise argument for the rejection and its status is highly debated in contemporary philosophy. However, some (for example, Boghossian&lt;ref name=Boghossian/&gt;) argue that Quine's rejection of the distinction is still widely accepted among philosophers, even if for poor reasons.

===Responses===
[[Paul Grice]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized "Two Dogmas" in their 1956 article "In Defense of a Dogma".&lt;ref name=Defense/&gt; Among other things, they argue that Quine's [[skepticism]] about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask "What does it mean?". If it makes sense to ask "What does it mean?", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question "What does it mean?" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of [[indeterminacy of translation]].

In ''Speech Acts'', [[John Searle]] argues that from the difficulties encountered in trying to explicate analyticity by appeal to specific criteria, it does not follow that the notion itself is void.&lt;ref name=Searle/&gt; Considering the way which we would test any proposed list of criteria, which is by comparing their extension to the set of analytic statements, it would follow that any explication of what analyticity means presupposes that we already have at our disposal a working notion of analyticity.

In "'Two Dogmas' Revisited", [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that Quine is attacking two different notions:&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;
{{quote|It seems to me there is as gross a distinction between 'All bachelors are unmarried' and 'There is a book on this table' as between any two things in this world, or at any rate, between any two linguistic expressions in the world;&lt;ref name=Putnam2/&gt;|Hilary Putnam|''Philosophical Papers'', p. 36}}

Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] by putting synonyms for synonyms is near [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what, however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern a priority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of a priority and sketch a methodology without it.&lt;ref name=Putnam1/&gt;

[[Jerrold Katz]], a one-time associate of [[Noam Chomsky]], countered the arguments of "Two Dogmas" directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.&lt;ref name=Linsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz1/&gt;

In ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis'', [[Scott Soames]] has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective:&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

:All necessary (and all ''a priori'') truths are analytic

:Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity.

It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published "Two Dogmas". Today, however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated. He says: "Very few philosophers today would accept either [of these assertions], both of which now seem decidedly antique."&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

==Peikoff's criticisms==
Philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], in his essay "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy",&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard, "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy" In ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology'' by Ayn Rand, Meridian Press, 1979, p 94 (first published in ''The Objectivist'' May 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; expands upon [[Ayn Rand]]'s analysis. He posits that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the following choice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; if it is about existents, it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logical argument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logic cannot establish it. If you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of your ''concepts'', then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal to your ''percepts'', then you cannot be certain of it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To Peikoff, the critical question is: What is included in the meaning of a concept?  He rejects the idea that some of the characteristics of a concept's referents are excluded from the concept.  Applying Rand's theory&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,'' 2nd edition, Meridian (Penguin Books), 1990 (first published in ''The Objectivist,'' July 1966 - February 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  that a concept is a "mental integration" of similar existents, treated as "units", he argues that concepts stand for and mean the actual existents, including all their characteristics, not just those used to pick out the referents or define the concept. He states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since a concept is an integration of units, it has no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of a concept consists of the units — the existents — which it integrates, including all the characteristics of these units.... The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, does not indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity — or from the concept.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, he argues that there is no valid distinction between "necessary" and "contingent" facts, and that all truths are learned and validated by the same process: the application of logic to perceptual data.  Associated with the analytic-synthetic dichotomy are a cluster of other divisions that Objectivism also regards as false and artificial, such as logical truth vs. factual truth, logically possible vs. empirically possible, and a priori vs. the a posteriori.

The '''belief–desire–intention''' ('''BDI''') model of human practical reasoning was developed by [[Michael Bratman]] as a way of explaining future-directed intention.

BDI is fundamentally reliant on [[folk psychology]] (the 'theory theory'), which is the notion that our mental models of the world are theories. It was used as a basis for developing the [[belief–desire–intention software model]].

==Applications==

BDI was part of the inspiration behind the [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI software architecture]], which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.

BDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629002644/http://cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de/csq/pdf-files/Wahl_Spada.pdf CRIBB]. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7906/21803/01011803.pdf rehabilitation strategy] to teach autistic children to reason about other people.

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conceptual framework''' is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.

[[Isaiah Berlin]] used the metaphor of [[The Hedgehog and the Fox|a "fox" and a "hedgehog"]] to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world.&lt;ref name="Berlin1953"&gt;{{citation |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |author-link=Isaiah Berlin |year=1953 |title=The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History}} [[London]]: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]; 1986 [[New York City|New York]]: [[Simon and Schuster]], introduction by M. Walzer.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Plato]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[James Joyce]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Aristotle]], [[Herodotus]], [[Molière]], and [[Honoré de Balzac]]).

Economists use the conceptual framework of "[[Supply (economics)|supply]]" and "[[Demand (economics)|demand]]" to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers.&lt;ref name="Colander2013"&gt;[[David Colander|Colander, David]]. 2013. ''Microeconomics,'' 9th edition, [[New York City|New York]]: [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] and Frank, Robert and [[Ben Bernanke]]. 2013. ''Principles of Microeconomics,'' 5th edition.

Both [[political Science]] and [[economics]] use [[Principal-agent problem|principal agent theory]] as a conceptual framework. The [[politics-administration dichotomy]] is a long standing conceptual framework used in [[public administration]].&lt;ref name="Overeem2012"&gt;{{citation |last=Overeem |first=P. |year=2012 |title=The Politics Administration Dichotomy: Toward a Constitutional Perspective |edition=2 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-4665-5899-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.

== Overview ==
The use of the term ''conceptual framework'' crosses both scale (large and small theories)&lt;ref name="RavitchRiggan2012"&gt;{{citation |author1=Ravitch |author2=Riggan |year=2012 |title=Reason and Rigor: How Conceptual Frameworks guide Research |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks CA]] |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Maxwell |first=J. |year=2009 |chapter=Designing a qualitative study |title=The State Handbook of Applied Social Science Research |editor-last1=Bickmam |editor-first1=L. |editor-last2=Rog |editor-first2=D. |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contexts (social science,&lt;ref name="Rodman1980"&gt;{{citation |last=Rodman |first=Hyman |title=Are Conceptual Frameworks Necessary for Theory Building?

Its explicit definition and application can therefore vary.

Conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research. One set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to [[deductive]], empirical research at the micro- or individual study level.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first=Patricia M. |author-link=Patricia M.

Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project's goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation – the ground). Critically, a football play is a "plan of action" tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage.&lt;ref name="Patricia2014"&gt;{{citation |last=Shields |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia M.

The national presentation was delivered before Public Administration graduate students in Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to "purpose" that make [[American football plays]] such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as "the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project's purpose".&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt; Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim.

Explanation is connected to hypotheses testing (as a framework). The other research purposes are not connected to a framework.&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanatory research usually focuses on "why" or "what caused" a phenomenon to occur. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose – explain factors that influenced home fires in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.&lt;ref name="Huang2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Huang |first=Kai |title=Population and Building Factors that impact residential fire rates in large U.S. Cities |publisher=Applied Research Projects, [[Texas State University]] |page=42 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3592 |year=2009}} The formal hypotheses took the form of relational statements. H1: environmental factors influence residential fire rates; H2: populations characteristics influence residential fire rates; H3: Building factors influence residential fire rates. These hypotheses could be represented visually as H1: A → RFR; H2: B → RFR; H3: C → RFR where A = environmental factors; B = population characteristics; C = Building Factors and RFR = Residential Fire Rates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified,&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsTravis2017"&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M.

* [[Working hypothesis]] – [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Pillar Questions - [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Descriptive categories – [[Description]] or [[Descriptive research]]
* Practical ideal type – [[Analysis]] (Gauging)
* Models of [[operations research]] – [[Decision making]]
* Formal hypothesis – [[Explanation]]  and [[Prediction]]

Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own [[research design]].&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;

Frameworks have also been used to explain [[conflict theory]] and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moorstein |first1=Mark |title=Frameworks, Conflict in Balance |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |isbn=978-0-5953-1824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anomalistics|Anomalies]] may exist without adequate "lenses" or "filters" to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]].

[[Image:Alembert.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean d'Alembert]] (1717—1783)]]
'''D'Alembert's principle''', also known as the '''Lagrange–d'Alembert principle''', is a statement of the fundamental [[classical physics|classical]] laws of motion. It is named after its discoverer, the [[France|French]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].  It is the dynamic analogue to the ''principle of [[virtual work]] for applied forces'' in a static system and in fact is  more general than [[Hamilton's principle]], avoiding restriction to [[holonomic system]]s.&lt;ref name=Lanczos&gt;{{cite book |last=Lanczos |first=Cornelius |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |edition=4th |year=1970 |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holonomic constraint depends only on the coordinates and time. It does not depend on the velocities. If the negative terms in accelerations are recognized as ''[[inertial force]]s'', the statement of d'Alembert's principle becomes ''The total virtual work of the impressed forces plus the inertial forces vanishes for reversible displacements''.&lt;ref name=Lanczos2&gt;{{cite book |title=p. 90 |author=Cornelius Lanczos   |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22#PPA90,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle does not apply for irreversible displacements, such as sliding [[friction]], and more general specification of the irreversibility is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Udwadia | first1 = F. E. | last2 = Kalaba | first2 = R. E. | title = On the Foundations of Analytical Dynamics | journal = Intl. Journ. Nonlinear Mechanics | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 1079–1090 | date = 2002 | url = http://ae-www.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_foundation_of_analytical_dynamics.pdf | doi = 10.1016/S0020-7462(01)00033-6 | bibcode = 2002IJNLM..37.1079U | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100613031338/http://ae-www.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_foundation_of_analytical_dynamics.pdf | archivedate = 2010-06-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle states that the sum of the differences between the [[force]]s acting on a system of mass particles and the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system itself projected onto any [[virtual displacement]] consistent with the constraints of the system is zero. Thus, in symbols d'Alembert's principle is written as following,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where :

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; || is an integer used to indicate (via subscript) a variable corresponding to a particular particle in the system,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the total applied force (excluding constraint forces) on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt; m_i \scriptstyle&lt;/math&gt; || is the mass of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the acceleration of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || together as product represents the time derivative of the momentum of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle if the masses do not change with time, and
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the virtual displacement of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle, consistent with the constraints.
|}

This above equation is often called d'Alembert's principle, but it was first written in this variational form by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1956), ''Mechanics:  Lectures on Theoretical Physics'', Vol 1, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Alembert's contribution was to demonstrate that in the totality of a dynamic system the forces of constraint vanish.  That is to say that the [[generalized forces]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf Q}_{j}&lt;/math&gt; need not include constraint forces.  It is equivalent to the somewhat more cumbersome [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]].

==General case with changing masses==
The general statement of d'Alembert's principle mentions "the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system". The momentum of the ''i''-th mass is the product of its mass and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_i = m_i \mathbf v_i&lt;/math&gt;

and its time derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i + m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In many applications, the masses are constant and this equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;,

which appears in the formula given above. However, some applications involve changing masses (for example, chains being rolled up or being unrolled) and in those cases both terms &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt; have to remain present, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i - \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i)\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation for special cases==
To date, nobody has shown that D'Alembert's principle is equivalent to [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]]. D'Alembert's principle is a more general case .  And it is true only for some very special cases e.g. rigid body constraints.  However, an approximate solution to this problem does exist.&lt;ref name="Rebhan2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rebhan |first=Eckhard |title=Mechanik |series=Theoretische Physik |year=2006 |publisher=Spektrum Akademischer Verlag |location=Heidelberg, Germany  |isbn=978-3-8274-1716-9 |chapter=Exkurs 5.1: Ableitung des d'Alembert Prinzips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider Newton's law for a system of particles, i. The total force on each particle is&lt;ref name="Torby1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Torby |first=Bruce |title=Advanced Dynamics for Engineers |series=HRW Series in Mechanical Engineering |year=1984 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |location=United States of America  |isbn=0-03-063366-4 |chapter=Energy Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} = m_i \mathbf {a}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)}&lt;/math&gt; || are the total forces acting on the system's particles,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf {a}_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || are the inertial forces that result from the total forces.
|}

Moving the inertial forces to the left gives an expression that can be considered to represent quasi-static equilibrium, but which is really just a small algebraic manipulation of Newton's law:&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} - m_i \mathbf {a}_i = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the [[virtual work]], &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt;, done by the total and inertial forces together through an arbitrary virtual displacement, &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt;, of the system leads to a zero identity, since the forces involved sum to zero for each particle.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The original vector equation could be recovered by recognizing that the work expression must hold for arbitrary displacements. Separating the total forces into applied forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_i&lt;/math&gt;, and constraint forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C_i&lt;/math&gt;, yields&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i + \sum_{i} \mathbf {C}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If arbitrary virtual displacements are assumed to be in directions that are orthogonal to the constraint forces (which is not usually the case, so this derivation works only for special cases), the constraint forces do no work. Such displacements are said to be ''consistent'' with the constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title = Teaching Students Work and Virtual Work Method in Statics:A Guiding Strategy with Illustrative Examples|first = Ing-Chang|last = Jong|conference = 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition|year = 2005|url = http://search.asee.org/search/fetch?url=file%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2FE%3A%2Fsearch%2Fconference%2F29%2FAC%25202005Paper1212.pdf&amp;index=conference_papers&amp;space=129746797203605791716676178&amp;type=application%2Fpdf&amp;charset=|accessdate = June 24, 2014|section = Improving Mechanics of Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the formulation of ''d'Alembert's principle'', which states that the difference of applied forces and inertial forces for a dynamic system does no virtual work:.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is also a corresponding principle for static systems called the [[virtual work#Principle of virtual work for applied forces|principle of virtual work for applied forces]].

==D'Alembert's principle of inertial forces==
D'Alembert showed that one can transform an accelerating rigid body into an equivalent static system by adding the so-called "[[inertial force]]"  and "[[inertial torque]]" or moment. The inertial force must act through the center of mass and the inertial torque can act anywhere. The system can then be analyzed exactly as a static system subjected to this "inertial force and moment" and the external forces. The advantage is that, in the equivalent static system one can take moments about any point (not just the center of mass). This often leads to simpler calculations because any force (in turn) can be eliminated from the moment equations by choosing the appropriate point about which to apply the moment equation (sum of moments = zero). Even in the course of Fundamentals of Dynamics and Kinematics of machines, this principle helps in analyzing the forces that act on a link of a mechanism when it is in motion. In textbooks of engineering dynamics this is sometimes referred to as ''d'Alembert's principle''.

===Example for 1D motion of a rigid body===
[[File:Dalembert example.JPG|thumb|280x280px|Free body diagram of a wire pulling on a mass with weight W, showing the d’Alembert inertia “force” ma.
]]
To illustrate the concept of ''d'Alembert's principle'', let's use a simple model with a weight''' '''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, suspended from a wire. The weight is subjected to a gravitational force, &lt;math&gt;W=mg&lt;/math&gt;, and a tension force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;''' '''in the wire. The mass accelerates upward with an acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]] becomes &lt;math&gt;T-W=ma&lt;/math&gt;''''' '''''or &lt;math&gt;T=W+ma&lt;/math&gt;. As an observer with feet planted firmly on the ground, we see that the force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; accelerates the weight, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, but, if we are moving with the wire we don’t see the acceleration, we feel it. The tension in the wire seems to counteract an acceleration “force” &lt;math&gt;ma&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(W/g)a&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Rigid Body in Free Fall with Angular Velocity.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Free body diagram depicting an inertia moment and an inertia force on a rigid body in free fall with an angular velocity.]]

===Example for plane 2D motion of a rigid body===
For a planar rigid body, moving in the plane of the body (the ''x''–''y'' plane), and subjected to forces and torques causing rotation only in this plane, the inertial force is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_i = - m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_c&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of the centre of mass of the body, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body. The inertial torque (or moment) is

:&lt;math&gt;T_i = -I\ddot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body. If, in addition to the external forces and torques acting on the body, the inertia force acting through the center of mass is added and the inertial torque is added (acting around the centre of mass is as good as anywhere) the system is equivalent to one in static equilibrium. Thus the equations of static equilibrium

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum F_x &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum F_y &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum T &amp;= 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

hold. The important thing is that &lt;math&gt;\sum T&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of torques (or moments, including the inertial moment and the moment of the inertial force) taken about ''any'' point. The direct application of Newton's laws requires that the angular acceleration equation be applied ''only'' about the center of mass.

===Dynamic equilibrium===
D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system.  Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates requires that is to be
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = (Q_1 + Q^*_1)\delta q_1 + \ldots + (Q_m + Q^*_m)\delta q_m = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
for any set of virtual displacements δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.  This condition yields m equations,
:&lt;math&gt; Q_j + Q^*_j = 0, \quad j=1, \ldots, m,&lt;/math&gt;
which can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} -\frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} = Q_j, \quad j=1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;
The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8874">[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|Visual representation of the Pythagorean theorem. Under the proposal the shape seen here would be drawn at vast size on the Siberian tundra using pine trees and fields of wheat.]]
'''Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal''' is an idea attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].

Although credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a "German Astronomer" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]], and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.

==Attribution==
The specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in [[University of Notre Dame]] Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900'', in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of this proposal&amp;nbsp;... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss&amp;nbsp;... the [proposal] appear[s]!&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, [[Joseph Johann Littrow]]'s statement in ''Wunder des Himmels'' that "one of our most distinguished geometers"&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; proposed that a geometric figure "for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; and Patrick Scott's ''Love in the Moon'', in which a "learned man" is described as proposing a signal formed by a "great plantation of tree" in the form of "47th Proposition of Euclid" in "the great African dessert {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; In ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to "communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In the writings of astronomers [[Asaph Hall]] and of [[Norman Lockyer]], each refer separately to a "German Astronomer" who proposed the method of contact be by "fire signals" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, [[Simon Newcomb]] placed the origin of a Siberian triangle "several hundred miles in extent" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]]. In lectures presented by [[François Arago]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed "German geometer",&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|Heliotrope]] in 1818,&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} square mirror to be seen {{convert|8|mi|km}} away even in sunny weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-lDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1872|editors=George Ripley &amp; Charles A. Dana|volume=IX|publisher=D. Appleton|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]], by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]]: "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon&amp;nbsp;.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the ''[[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with [[Franz von Gruithuisen]], Gauss stated words to the effect that "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13067">The '''General Group Problem Solving (GGPS) Model''' is a [[problem solving]] methodology, in which a group of individuals will define the desired outcome, identify the gap between the current state and the target and generate ideas for closing the gap by [[brainstorming]]. The end result is list of actions needed to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6wsVIuA03YC | title=Group Problem Solving | publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Laughlin, Patrick R. | year=2011 | pages=1 | isbn=9781400836673 | quote=In the most general sense, a problem is a discrepancy between a current less desirable state and a future more desirable state.

==Beyond groupthink==
Sally Fuller and Ramon Aldag argue that group [[decision-making]] models have been operating under too narrow of a focus due to the overemphasis of the [[groupthink]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ggps_model"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/2323226/The_GGPS_Model_Broadening_the_perspective_on_group_problem_solving | title=The GGPS Model: Broadening the perspective on group problem solving | work=Groups at work: Theory and research | date=2001 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | last1=Fuller | first1=Sally R. | last2=Aldag | first2=Ramon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/scie/Career/Wisdom/groupthink1.htm | title=Groupthink | work=Psychology Today | date=November 1971 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | pages=43-46, 74-76 | quote=Groupthink is a psychological terminology used to describe the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive ingroup that it tends to override realistic appraisal of alternative courses of action.

The symptoms of groupthink arise when the members of decision-making groups become motivated to avoid being too harsh in their judgments of their leaders' or their colleagues' ideas.  People would adopt a soft line of criticism and avoid conflict, even in their own thinking.  At meetings, all members are amiable and seek complete concurrence, which is likely to be recognized erroneously as consensus, on every important issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Victims_of_Groupthink.html?id=FB13AAAAMAAJ | title=Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign-Policy Decisions and Fiascoes | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1972 | isbn=9780395140024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to them, group decision-making has often been framed in relative isolation, ignoring context and real-world circumstances, which is a likely consequence of testing group decision-making in laboratory studies. They claim that the groupthink model is overly deterministic and an unrealistically restrictive depiction of the group problem-solving process.” &lt;ref name="ggps_model" /&gt; To address these problems, they propose a new model that incorporates elements of group decision-making processes from a broader, more comprehensive perspective, offering a more general and generalizable framework for future research.&lt;ref name="fiasco"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1993-29328-001 | title=Beyond fiasco: a reappraisal of the groupthink phenomenon and a new model of group decision processes | author=Aldag, R.J. | last2=Fuller | first2=S.R. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=May 1993  | volume=113 | issue=3 | pages=533-552 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.3.533 | quote=...research does not provide convincing support for the validity of the groupthink phenomenon or for the suggestion that groupthink characteristics lead to negative outcomes.

This model incorporates a variety of antecedent conditions, emergent group characteristics, decision process characteristics, and group decision outcomes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model includes elements of [[Irving Janis|Irving Janis's]] original model (1977), but only those that have been consistently supported by the literature.&lt;ref name="decision_making"&gt;{{cite book | title=Decision making: a psychological analysis of conflict, choice, and commitment | publisher=Free Press | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1977 | isbn=9780029161609 | last2=Mann | first2=Leon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the differences between the two models, we briefly summarize both Janis's model and the '''GGPS-model''' first.

==The original groupthink model==
Janis defines groupthink as “the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive in-group that it tends to over-ride realistic appraisals of alternative courses of action.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis" /&gt; In a subsequent article, he elaborates on this by saying: “I use the term "groupthink" as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.  Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims" /&gt;
All this suggests that the original groupthink model was proposed for a rather specific situation, and Janis states that we can only call a phenomenon groupthink if all the warning signs are present (see [[Groupthink#Symptoms|groupthink symptoms]]).

[[File:Groupthink schematic.JPG|Groupthink schematic]]{{or|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref name="decision_making" /&gt;

==The GGPS-model==
The GGPS-model (developed by Ramon Aldag and Sally Fuller) broadens the perspectives, incorporating elements of the original groupthink model, in a fashion that creates a more widely applicable schematic.
Two key differences should be noted in comparison to Janis’ model:

# The GGPS model presents elements of the group problem-solving process in a value-neutral manner. The groupthink model is restrictive and deterministic in the sense that numerous elements are phrased to suggest that certain aspects of the process are pathological, such as ”too few alternatives”.  The GGPS model suggests no such assumptions in its terms, and recasts this term as ”number of alternatives”. 
# Fuller and Aldag argue that a comprehensive model has to reflect the political environment of the real world and real workplaces. Thus, the GGPS model considers a larger set of antecedents than the groupthink model, among these are group type, leader power, organizational political norms etc.

===Elements of the GGPS model===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
====Antecedents====

Three sets of [[Antecedent_(logic)|antecedents]] are proposed by GGPS: decision characteristics, group structure and decision-making context.

=====Decision characteristics=====
Elements belonging here are the importance of the decision, time pressure, structure, procedural requirements, and task characteristics.

''Examples'': whether the task is simple or complex will make a substantial difference in required member input, as well as in whether a directive leader is necessary. Group interaction is also altered if, given a task, a single correct answer exists and if it becomes obvious to any of the members, since subsequent group interaction will likely be reduced.

=====Group structure=====
Elements are cohesiveness, members’ homogeneity, insulation of the group, leader impartiality, leader power, history of the group, probability of future interaction, stage of group development and type of group.

''Examples'': whether group members anticipate to work together again in the future can have a major impact on to what degree can political motives influence the process. If it’s unlikely that the group will come together again, political influence can be lessened. Stage of group development is important because members of  mature group with a long history may feel more comfortable challenging each other’s ideas, thus cohesiveness results in quality decision making and positive outcomes.

=====Decision making context=====
Elements are organizational political norms, member political motives, prior discussion of issue, prior goal attainment, goal definition, and degree of stress from external threat.

''Examples'': whether group members identified and pursue a unitary goal or they have multiple, discrepant goals influences the rationality of the decision-making process. Members’ political motives also make a tremendous difference, if individuals have a vested interest in certain outcomes, or there are one or more coalitions present, behavior in the decision making process could be altered.

====Emergent group characteristics====

The model differentiates two categories of emergent group characteristics: group perceptions and processes.

=====Group Perceptions=====
These include members’ perceptions of the group’s vulnerability, the inherent morality of the group, member unanimity, and views of opposing groups.

=====Group Processes=====
These include the group’s response to negative feedback, treatment of dissenters, [[self-censorship]], and use of [[mindguard]]s.

====Decision process characteristics====

Decision process characteristics are grouped in terms of the first three stages of group problem-solving processes: problem identification, alternative generation and evaluation and choice. Implementation and control stages are not included because they follow the actual decision, but some variables preparing for those stages are indeed included (e.g. development of contingency plans and gathering of control-related information).

=====Problem identification=====
Elements of this stage are predecisional information search, survey of objectives, and explicit problem definition.

''Example'': if members of the group fail to explicitly or correctly define the problem, there is a chance that they will solve the wrong problem.

=====Alternative generation=====
Elements are number of alternatives and quality of alternatives.

''Example'': in generating alternatives, it’s important to differentiate quality and quantity of alternative ideas generated. Some group processes, such as brainstorming, are directed towards generating large numbers of ideas, with the assumption that it will lead to a superior alternative. Defective processes, on the other hand, might lead to large numbers of low quality ideas.

=====Evaluation and choice=====
Elements are information processing quality, the source of the initial selection of a preferred alternative, emergence of preferred alternative, group decision rule, timing of convergence, reexamination of preferred and rejected alternatives, source of the final solution, development of contingency plans, and gathering of control-related information.

''Example'': whether the group decides based on a majority rule or a consensus has to be reached, makes a great difference in the process. If a consensus is to be reached, dissent could be discouraged, because dissenters could elongate and jeopardize the process. With a majority rule, dissent is more acceptable.

====Outcomes====

The GGPS model includes an array of decision, political and affective outcomes.

'''''Decision outcomes''''': include acceptance of the decision by those affected by it and/or those who have to implement it, adherence to the decision, implementation success, and decision quality.

''Example'': if the leader of the group is not satisfied with the decision, he/she might unilaterally reverse it.

'''''Political outcomes''''': include future motivation of the leader, future motivation of the group and future use of the group.

''Example'': if the outcome did not satisfy the political agenda of the leader, he/she might use the group less or not at all in the future.

'''''Affective outcomes''''': include satisfaction with the leader, satisfaction with the group process and satisfaction with the decision.

''Example'': whether members are content with the fairness of the group process, whether trust was developed and preserved, or whether commitment to the decision is strong will greatly influence the group’s future functioning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">'''Gossen's laws''', named for [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810 – 1858), are three laws of economics:
* '''Gossen's First Law''' is the [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|"law" of diminishing marginal utility]]: that [[marginal utility|marginal utilities]] are diminishing across the ranges relevant to decision-making.
* '''[[Gossen's second law|Gossen's Second Law]]''', which presumes that [[utility]] is at least weakly quantified, is that in equilibrium an agent will allocate expenditures so that the ratio of marginal utility to price (marginal cost of acquisition) is equal across all [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]].
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}\,\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:where
:* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is utility
:* &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is quantity of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
:* &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
* '''Gossen's Third Law''' is that [[scarcity]] is a precondition for economic value.

The citation referenced is the translation by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in which the traslator names only two laws: 1) ”If an enjoyment is experienced uninterruptedly, the corresponding intensity of pleasure decreases continuously until satiety is ultimately reached, at which point the intensity becomes nil." and, 2) "A similar decrease of the intensity of pleasure takes place if a previous enjoyment of the same kind of pleasure is repeated. Not only does the initial intensity of pleasure become smaller but also the duration of the enjoyment becomes shorter, so that satiety is reached sooner. Moreover, the sooner the repetition, the smaller becomes the initial intensity as well as the duration of the enjoyment." (p.lxxx)

Ideas can also be [[abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]]s that do not present as mental images.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Audi|editor1-first=Robert|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-40224-7|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[philosophers]] have considered ideas to be a fundamental [[ontological]] [[category of being]]. The capacity to [[creativity|create]] and [[understanding|understand]] the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of [[human|human beings]]. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious [[introspection|reflection]], for example, when we talk about the ''idea'' of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeytimes.com/ideas/312/What_is_an_Idea/ |title=What is an Idea? |year=2011 |work=AeyTimes Idea Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''idea'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]] ''idea'' "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν ''idein'', "to see." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/idea |title=Definition of ''idea'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innate and adventitious ideas==
{{Main|Innate idea}}
One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called ''innate ideas'') which are so general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our [[perception]] but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ adventitious ideas]'' which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"/&gt;

Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from [[nurture]] (life experiences) is known as ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate"). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term "idea" to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of [[innate idea]]s, "[[abstract object|concrete ideas]] versus [[abstraction|abstract ideas]]", as well as "simple ideas versus complex ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-02-894950-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}} Vol 4: 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Plato===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] in [[Ancient Greece]] was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (it must be noted that in Plato's Greek the word ''idea'' carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'', ''Republic'', and ''Timaeus'' that there is a realm of ideas or forms (''eidei''), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the ''Republic'':
{{quote|
"We both assert that there are," I said, "and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing."

"Yes, so we do."

"And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one ''idea'' of each as though the ''idea'' were one; and we address it as that which really ''is''."

"That's so."

"And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ''ideas'' are intellected but not seen."|Plato|Bk. VI 507b-c}}

===René Descartes===
[[Descartes]] often wrote of the meaning of ''idea'' as an image or representation, often but not necessarily "in the mind", which was well known in the [[vernacular]]. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' he says, "Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained that ideas were [[innate idea|innate]] &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; and uses of the term ''idea'' diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ''ideas'' inconsistently into various genetic categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas Descartes's Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
In striking contrast to Plato's use of idea &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 487–503&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[John Locke]]. In his Introduction to [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], Locke defines ''idea'' as "that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |wslink=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Introduction |section=Introduction |first=John |last=Locke |at=§ What Idea stands for.|year=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he regarded the book necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In his philosophy other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in the 19th century, and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Karl Popper]] in the 20th century. Locke always believed in ''good sense'' — not pushing things to extremes and on taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He considered his common-sense ideas "good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth."

As John Locke studied humans in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding” he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: “When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions.&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas, and what are the different types of ideas. An idea to Locke “can simply mean some sort of brute experience.” &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, John R. Starting with Mill. Continuum, 2010. Starting With. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true &amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344063&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that there are “No innate principles in the mind.”.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he concludes that “our ideas are all experiential in nature.” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: “consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, an idea was an  experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas  are the building blocks for much more complex ideas, and “While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct= true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be modes, substances, or relations. Modes are when ideas are combined in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach &lt;ref&gt;Banach, David. "Locke on Ideas." Locke on Ideas. St. Anselm College, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; gives the example of beauty as a mode. He says that it is the combination of color and form. Substances, however, is different. Substances are certain objects, that can either be dogs, cats, or tables. And relations represent the relationship between two or more ideas.  In this way, Locke did, in fact, answer his own questions about ideas and humans.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume|Hume]] differs from Locke by limiting ''idea'' to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being described as an "impression." &lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Idea |volume=14 |pages=280–281 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 74–90&lt;/ref&gt; Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others') that humans' knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Hume has contended and defended the notion that "reason alone is merely the 'slave of the passions'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David: A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects. (1739–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|135px|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] defines an ''idea'' as opposed to a ''[[Concept#A priori concepts|concept]]''. "Regulative ideas" are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized. [[Liberty]], according to Kant, is an idea. The [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of the rational and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is opposed to the [[determinism]] of the [[empirical]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 305–324&lt;/ref&gt; Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgements of good common sense.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge ("we can never know the thing in itself"), in his [[epistemological]] work, [[Rudolf Steiner]] sees ''ideas'' as "objects of experience" which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In ''[[Goethean Science]]'' (1883), he declares, "Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas." He holds this to be the premise upon which [[Goethe]] made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
[[Wundt]] widens the term from Kant's usage to include ''conscious representation of some object or process of the external world''. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of [[memory]] and [[imagination]], but also [[perceptual]] processes, whereas other [[psychologist]]s confine the term to the first two groups.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by [[experiment]] and [[introspection]]. He regarded both of these as ''exact methods'', interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other ''objectively valuable aids'', specifically to ''those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.'' Wundt designed the basic mental activity [[apperception]] — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of [[assimilation (philosophy)|assimilation]] and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of ''objective'' methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 8: 349–351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] published the first full statement of [[pragmatism]] in his important works "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) and "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|Peirce's pragmatism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" he proposed that a ''clear idea'' (in his study he uses [[concept]] and ''idea'' as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. [[Pragmatism]] (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge by scientists for some 250 years, i.e. that, he pointed, knowledge was an impersonal fact. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as ''participants'', not as ''spectators''. He felt "the real", sooner or later, is information acquired through ideas and knowledge with the application of logical reasoning would finally result in. He also published many papers on logic in relation to ''ideas''.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] and [[James Mark Baldwin|J. M. Baldwin]], in the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', define ''idea'' as "the reproduction with a more or less adequate [[image]], of an object not actually present to the senses."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Baldwin/Dictionary Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. "Difference in degree of intensity", "comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject", "comparative dependence on mental activity", are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a [[perception]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say "This is a chair, that is a stool", he has what is known as an "abstract idea" distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see [[abstraction]]). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a [[centaur]] is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of [[man]] and [[horse]], that of a [[mermaid]] of a [[woman]] and a [[fish]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
[[Diffusion (anthropology)|Diffusion]] studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another.  [[Everett Rogers]] pioneered [[diffusion of innovations]] studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested applying biological [[evolution]]ary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe an abstract unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]], equivalent to the [[gene]] in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Semantics==

===Samuel Johnson===
[[James Boswell]] recorded [[Samuel Johnson]]'s opinion about ideas. Johnson claimed that they are [[mental image]]s or internal visual pictures. As such, they have no relation to words or the concepts which are designated by verbal names.

{{Quotation|He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word ''idea'' in the sense of ''notion'' or ''opinion'' when it is clear that ''idea'' can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of an ''argument'' or ''proposition''. Yet we hear the sages of the law 'delivering their ''ideas'' upon the question under consideration;' and the first speakers in parliament 'entirely coinciding with the ''idea'' which has been ably stated by an honourable member;' — or 'reprobating an ''idea'' unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.' Johnson called this 'modern cant.'|Boswell's [[Life of Johnson]]|Tuesday, 23 September 1777}}

==Relationship of ideas to modern legal time- and scope-limited monopolies==
{{main|Intellectual property|Idea-expression divide}}

===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
{{Quotation|It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even a hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance.

By a universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed an exclusive and stable property.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at my mine, receives light without darkening me.

Those ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8Article 1, Section 8] (Electronic resources from the University of Chicago Press Books Division)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Thomas Jefferson]], letter to [[Isaac V. McPherson|Isaac McPherson]], 13 August 1813}}

To protect the cause of invention and innovation, the legal constructions of Copyrights and Patents were established. [[Patent]] law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===

[[File:Crystal Clear app ktip.svg|thumb|150px|A picture of a [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulb]] is often used to represent a person having a ''bright'' ''idea''.]]
In some cases, authors can be granted limited [[legal]] monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as [[copyright]], although the term [[intellectual property]] is used mistakenly in place of ''copyright''. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of [[property]] upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from [[patent]] law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A [[copyright]] is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, ''not'' an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/15/protecting-ideas-can-ideas-be-protected-or-patented/id=48009/ Protecting Ideas: Can Ideas Be Protected or Patented?] – article by [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/author/gene-quinn-2/ Gene Quinn] at [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/ Ipwatchdog], February 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright protection extends to a description, explanation, or illustration of an idea or system, assuming that the requirements of copyright law are met.

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and [[nondisclosure agreements]] are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''instantiation principle''' or '''principle of instantiation''' or '''principle of exemplification''' is the [[concept]] in [[metaphysics]] and [[logic]] (first put forward by [[David Malet Armstrong]]) that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified [[property (philosophy)|properties]] (or [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]). In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object.

Consider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus, according to the principle of instantiation, the property of being a chair did not exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly, if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the property of being red would likewise go out of existence.

To make the principle more plausible in the light of these examples, the existence of properties or universals is not tied to their actual existence now, but to their existence in space-time considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The property of being red would exist even if all red things were to be destroyed, because it has been instantiated. This broadens the range of properties which exist if the principle is true. 

Those who endorse the principle of instantiation are known as ''in re'' (in thing or in reality) realists or '[[immanent realist]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:RudolfvonIhering2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rudolf von Ihering, one of the juris philosophers of the jurisprudence of concepts]]
The '''jurisprudence of concepts''' was the first ''sub-school'' of [[legal positivism]],&lt;ref name="ARCOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcos.org.br/livros/hermeneutica-juridica/capitulo-iii-o-positivismo-normativista/3-a-jurisprudencia-dos-conceitos/|title=A Jurisprudência dos Conceitos|author=Costa, Alexandre Araújo|publisher=Arcos|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|title=A importância da Jurisprudência dos Conceitos para a Metodologia Jurídica|author=Pepino, Elsa Maria Lopes Ferreira; Graviorno, Gracimeri, Vieira Soeiro de Castro; Filgueira, Sofia Varejão|publisher=Revista Depoimentos, da Faculdade de Direito de Vitória|accessdate=17 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119225127/http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which, the written [[law]] must reflect [[concept]]s, when [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;that means that the interpretation of the words stated in the law must be guided by the scientific concepts that these words represent.&lt;/ref&gt; Its main representatives were [[Rudolf von Ihering|Ihering]], [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] and [[Georg Friedrich Puchta|Puchta]].

This school was, thus, the preceding trigger of the idea that law comes from a dogmatic source, imposition from man over man and not a ''natural'' consequence of other sciences or of metaphysical faith.

Among the main characters of the ''jurisprudence of concepts'' are:
* formalism, search of rights in written law
* systemisation
* search for justifying specific norm with basis from more generic ones.&lt;ref name="RSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seer.ucp.br/seer/index.php/LexHumana/article/download/5/4|title=Evolução Histórica da Teoria Hermenêutica - do Formalismo do Século XVIII ao Pós-Positivismo|author=Rocha, Sérgio André|year=2009|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, according to this school, law should have prevailing sources based upon the legislative process, although needing to be proven by more inclusive ideas of a social sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9707">'''LaSalle's invariance principle''' (also known as the '''invariance principle''',&lt;ref name=Khalil&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khalil|first1=Hasan|title=Nonlinear Systems|date=2002|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River NJ|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Barbashin-Krasovskii-LaSalle principle''',&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wassim|first1=Haddad|last2=Chellaboina|first2=VijaySekhar|title=Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Control, a Lyapunov-based approach|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Krasovskii-LaSalle principle''' ) is a criterion for the [[asymptotic stability]] of an autonomous (possibly nonlinear) [[dynamical system]].

== Global version ==

Suppose a system is represented as

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f \left(\mathbf x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of variables, with

: &lt;math&gt; f \left( \mathbf 0 \right) = \mathbf 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;  (negative semidefinite),

then the set of [[accumulation point]]s of any trajectory is contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set &lt;math&gt; \{\mathbf x : \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we additionally have that the function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   for all  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; V( \mathbf 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and if &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the origin is [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is radially unbounded, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt; V(\mathbf x) \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;, as     &lt;math&gt; \Vert \mathbf x \Vert \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;

then the origin is globally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Local version ==

If 
: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   when  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

hold only for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x &lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the origin, and the set

: &lt;math&gt; \{ \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \} \bigcap D &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t)=\mathbf 0, t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the local version of the invariance principle states that the origin is locally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Relation to Lyapunov theory ==

If &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} ( \mathbf x) &lt;/math&gt; is [[negative definite]], the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. The invariance principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} ( \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]].

== Example: the pendulum with friction ==

This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local [[asymptotic stability]] of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation {{ref|nd1}}

:&lt;math&gt; m l \ddot{\theta} = - m g \sin \theta - k l \dot{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum,  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction coefficient]], and [[standard gravity|''g'']] is acceleration due to gravity.

This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_1 = x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_2 = -\frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 - \frac{k}{m} x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converge to the origin. We define &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; V(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} (1 - \cos x_1) + \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is simply the scaled energy of the system {{ref|nd2}} Clearly, &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2) &lt;/math&gt; is [[positive definite]] in an open ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; around the origin. Computing the derivative,

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 \dot{x}_1 + x_2 \dot{x}_2 =  - \frac{k}{m} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;V(0) = \dot{V}(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If it were true that &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]]. However, the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | x_2 = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory '''x''' = '''0'''. Indeed, if at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;, then because 
&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; away from the origin, &lt;math&gt; \sin x_1 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; {{ref|tw1}}.

== History ==
The general result was independently discovered by [[Joseph P. LaSalle|J.P. LaSalle]] (then at [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies|RIAS]]) and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|N.N. Krasovskii]], who published in 1960 and 1959 respectively. While [[Joseph P. LaSalle|LaSalle]] was the first author in the West to publish the general theorem in 1960, a special case of the theorem was in communicated in 1952 by Barbashin and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]], followed by a publication of the general result in 1959 by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]] {{ref|vid}}.

In [[forensic science]], '''Locard's exchange principle'''  holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as [[forensic evidence]]. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]] (13 December 1877 – 4 May 1966) was a pioneer in forensic science who became known as the [[Sherlock Holmes]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;http://aboutforensics.co.uk/edmond-locard/&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: "Every contact leaves a trace". Paul L. Kirk&lt;ref&gt;''Crime investigation: physical evidence and the police laboratory''. Interscience Publishers, Inc.: New York, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the principle as follows:

:"Wherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value."

Fragmentary or [[trace evidence]] is any type of material left at (or taken from) a crime scene, or the result of contact between two surfaces, such as shoes and the floor covering or soil, or fibers from where someone sat on an upholstered chair.

When a crime is committed, fragmentary (or trace) evidence needs to be collected from the scene. A team of specialized police technicians goes to the scene of the crime and seals it off. They record video and take photographs of the crime scene, victim/s (if there are any) and items of evidence. If necessary, they undertake ballistics examinations. They check for foot, shoe, and tire mark impressions, plus hair as well as examine any vehicles and check for fingerprints - whole or partial.

==Famous cases==

The case studies below show how prevalent Locard's Exchange Principle is in each and every crime. The examples using Locard's Principle show not only how the transfer of trace evidence can tell the tale of what happened, but also how much care is required when collecting and evaluating trace evidence.

===The Weimar children murders===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Karola and Melanie Weimar, aged 5 and 7, lived with their parents, Reinhard and Monika, in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, Gerhard. [http://strate.net/en/publications/weimar_murder_case.html “The Weimar murder case – strength and risk of material evidence,"] Hamburg, 05/01/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Monika Böttcher|Monika Böttcher.]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were reported missing on 4 August 1986. Their bodies were found on 7 August. They had been murdered.

Monika first said the children had breakfast, then went to a [[playground]]. Three weeks later she said they were already dead when she returned home the previous night: Reinhard was sitting on the edge of Karola's bed, weeping and confused; he then disposed of the bodies.

Both parents were suspected, but Monika was having an [[affair]], and was seen where Melanie's body was later found. She was convicted, but after serving her sentence, was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrichsen, Gisela. [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/ende-eines-justizdramas-zweifache-kindsmoerderin-monika-boettcher-ist-frei-a-432435.html “End of a judicial drama: twice infanticide Monika Böttcher is free,"] Spiegel online Panorama, August 18, 2006. Retrieved December 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators determined what clothes Monika was wearing on 3 and 4 August, but not Reinhard's clothes, so only [[fibers]] from her clothing were identified on the children's bodies, yet they were also constantly in contact with him.

The [[bedding]] contained 14 fibers from Karola's [[T-shirt]]. Frictionless tests, simulating a dead child, matched that figure better than the friction tests, simulating a live child, so Karola could have lain lifelessly in bed wearing her T-shirt, as stated by her mother.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

35 fibers from Monika's [[blouse]] were found on the back of Melanie's T-shirt, but only one on her [[bed sheet]]. In tests, between 6 and 10 fibers remained on the sheet. These higher numbers were thought{{by whom|date=March 2016}} to disprove Monika's claim that she gave her child a goodbye [[hug]] the previous day. However, there are several likely explanations. For example, the bedding was put in one bag, so fibers from the sheet could have been transferred to the cover and [[pillow]]. Only the central area of the top of the sheet was taped: it might have originally contained more than one blouse fiber, the others could have been transferred to the back or sides while in the bag.

The blouse fibers on Melanie's clothing were distributed evenly, not the clusters expected from carrying the body.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

265 fibers from the family car’s rear seat covers were found on Melanie's [[panties]] and the inside of her trousers, but only a small number of fibers from the front seats was found on the children. This helped disprove the theory that they were killed on the front seats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Melanie's clothes and hair were covered in 375 clinging fruits of [[Galium aparine|goosegrass]]. As some of these itchy things were on the inside of her trousers and on her panties, the trousers must have been put on her after death.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

No [[sand]] was found on the bodies or clothing (including socks and [[sandals]]) of either child, making the morning playground story unlikely.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== The Westerfield-van Dam case ===

[[David Westerfield|Danielle van Dam]], aged 7, lived with her parents and brothers in [[San Diego]], California. She was reported missing on 2 February 2002; her body was discovered on 27 February. Neighbor [[David Westerfield]] was almost immediately suspected, as he had gone [[camping]] in his [[RV]], and he was convicted of her [[kidnapping]] and murder.

Hairs consistent with the van Dams’ dog were found in his RV, also carpet fibers consistent with Danielle's [[bedroom]] carpet. Danielle's nightly [[ritual]] was to [[wrestle]] with the dog after getting into her [[pajamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prosecution]] argued that those hairs and fibers got onto her pajamas through that contact, and were then carried on the pajamas to first Westerfield's house and then to his RV, when he kidnapped her from her bed. The alternative scenario is that they got onto her daytime clothes, and those of her mother and younger brother, and were carried to his house when they visited him earlier that week selling [[cookies]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020808-9999_1n8feldman.html “Lawyer says case against defendant is 'guesswork',"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 8 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He said his laundry was out during that visit, so trace evidence from them could have got on it, and then been transferred to his bedroom and his RV (secondary Locard transfer).&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, his RV was often parked, sometimes unlocked, in the neighborhood streets, so Danielle could have sneaked inside, leaving behind that evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No trace of Westerfield was found in the van Dam house.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Jeff. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020806-9999-final.html “Physical evidence shows Westerfield committed 'evil, evil crime,' prosecutor says,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

14 hairs consistent with Danielle's were found in his environment. All but one were compared on only [[mitochondrial DNA]], so they might have come from her mother or a sibling.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/27/export12906.txt “DNA expert: Hair was Danielle's,"] North County Times, 26 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most (21) of the hairs were in a dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] ball in his [[waste container|trash can]], so they might have got in his laundry before the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 5 carpet fibers in his RV, but none in his house, suggesting those were deposited by someone going directly from her house to his RV, or they may have come from another house in that development.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020625-9999_1m25hair.html “Criminalist links hairs, carpet fibers to Danielle: Evidence found in defendant's home,”] San Diego Union-Tribune, 25 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No Danielle pajama or bedding fibers were reported in his environment. There was no trace evidence in his [[SUV]] (which casts doubt on the belief that she was transported from his house to his RV in his SUV).&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He vacuumed his RV after the kidnapping, but no trace evidence was in the [[vacuum cleaner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Harriet. [http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html “Experts: Girl's prints found in Westerfield's RV,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204211022/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html |date=4 February 2009 }} Court TV, 20 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

One orange fiber with her body was consistent with about 200 in his house and 20 in his SUV (none in his RV), while 21 blue fibers with her body were consistent with 10 in his house and 46 in his RV (none in his SUV). Contrary to media reports, only a few items from her house were tested so that can’t be excluded as the source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/witnesses-sta.html “Witnesses for the Prosecution,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227001224/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/witnesses-sta.html |date=27 December 2008 }} Court TV, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the clothes of Danielle and her family during the cookie sale were not determined and eliminated. There were apparently two different types of the orange fibers, dull and very bright (so the number which matched might have been much less than 200).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/photogallery/evidence28.html “A Single Strand,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406142035/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/photogallery/evidence28.html |date=6 April 2009 }} Court TV, photogallery, evidence28, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; There were red fibers with her [[fingernails]], and many other fibers with her body, which could not be matched to his environment.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The only non-Danielle hair found with her body wasn’t his, nor was any desert sand reported with the body, and no soil or vegetation from the dump site was reported on his shoes, laundry, shovel or RV.

To explain why so much expected evidence was missing, the prosecution argued that he went on a cleaning frenzy, and tossed out evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21697">In [[theoretical physics]], particularly in [[discussions]] of [[:Category:Theories of gravitation|gravitation theories]],  '''Mach's principle''' (or '''Mach's conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Von Bayer, ''The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science'', Courier Dover Publications (2001), {{ISBN|0-486-41707-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VhJr9Qx8ohsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=mach's+conjecture&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Scny_DNMuM&amp;sig=Wm2-2sWSkBltjREyyxNkh1g-wFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result page 79].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name given by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to an imprecise hypothesis often credited to the [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach#Philosophy of science|Ernst Mach]]. The idea is that the existence of [[absolute rotation]] (the distinction of local [[inertial frame]]s vs. [[rotating reference frame]]s) is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |last=Steven |first=Weinberg |publisher= Wiley |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-471-92567-5 |location=USA |pages= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mach's principle says that this is not a coincidence—that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here". A very general statement of Mach's principle is "local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe".&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time |author1=Stephen W. Hawking  |author2=George Francis Rayner Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-0-521-09906-6 |date=1973 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QagG_KI7Ll8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ellis+inauthor:Hawking#PPA1,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the [[general theory of relativity]]. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[Gödel metric|Gödel rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Berkeley | title=The Principles of Human Knowledge | date=1726}} See paragraphs 111–117, 1710.&lt;/ref&gt; The book  ''Absolute or Relative Motion?'' (1896) by [[Benedict Friedländer]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

== Einstein's use of the principle ==
There is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.

In Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub. Co. |date=1960 |lccn= 60010179 }} This is a reprint of the English translation by Thomas H. MCormack (first published in 1906) with a new introduction by [[Karl Menger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe.There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.}}

[[Albert Einstein]] seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines of:&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;A. Einstein, letter to Ernst Mach, Zurich, 25 June 1913, in {{cite book |author1=Misner, Charles |author2=Thorne, Kip S. |author3=Wheeler, John Archibald |last-author-amp=yes |title= Gravitation |location= San Francisco |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}

In this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.

The writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was "The Science of Mechanics", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called "Newton's [[bucket argument]]".

In his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that:

{{quote|one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.}}

Mach, in his book, says that:

{{quote|the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and "absolute" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.}}

This same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere "redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) | title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the former way, originating a long-lasting debate.

Most physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect. It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |place=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7|pages=9–57}} (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].

== Mach's principle in general relativity ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by "Mach's principle" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location= Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=530}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.

Einstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:
{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;}}

The Lense–Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that "matter there influences inertia here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that "inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.

More fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as "the fixed stars".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.

A stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler–Mach–Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space |compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where "a particular moment in the universe" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=188–207}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in Tübingen in 1993, when asked the question "Is general relativity perfectly Machian?", 3 respondents replied "yes", and 22 replied "no".  To the question "Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?" the result was 14 "yes" and 7 "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7 |page=106}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:
{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:
# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.
# The principle of equivalence.
# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): … that the ''g&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;''. 
In 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, 
"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however."

It must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther. It must also be said that the origin of inertia is and remains the most obscure subject in the theory of particles and fields. Mach's principle may therefore have a future – but not without the quantum theory.

== Variations in the statement of the principle ==
The broad notion that "mass there influences inertia here" has been expressed in several forms.
[[Hermann Bondi]] and Joseph Samuel have listed eleven distinct statements that can be called Mach principles, labelled by ''Mach0'' through ''Mach10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bondi, Hermann |author2=Samuel, Joseph |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |volume=228 |issue=3 |journal=Physics Letters A |pages=121–126 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B}}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles", which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  Though their list is not necessarily exhaustive, it does give a flavor for the variety possible.

* ''Mach0'': The universe, as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies, does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames.
* ''Mach1'': Newton’s [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is a [[dynamical field]].
* ''Mach2'': An isolated body in otherwise empty space has no inertia.
* ''Mach3'': Local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter.
* ''Mach4'': The universe is spatially closed.
* ''Mach5'': The total energy, angular and linear momentum of the universe are zero.
* ''Mach6'': Inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter.
* ''Mach7'': If you take away all matter, there is no more space.
* ''Mach8'': &lt;math&gt;\Omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ 4 \pi \rho G T^2&lt;/math&gt; is a definite number, of order unity, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mean density of matter in the universe, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble time]].
* ''Mach9'': The theory contains no absolute elements.
* ''Mach10'': Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable.

'''Marginalism''' is a theory of [[economics]] that attempts to explain the discrepancy in the value of goods and services by reference to their secondary, or marginal, utility. The reason why the price of diamonds is higher than that of water, for example, owes to the greater additional satisfaction of the diamonds over the water. Thus, while the water has greater total utility, the diamond has greater [[marginal utility]].

Although the central concept of marginalism is that of [[marginal utility]], marginalists, following the lead of [[Alfred Marshall]], drew upon the idea of [[Marginal product|marginal physical productivity]] in explanation of [[cost]]. The [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] tradition that emerged from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] marginalism abandoned the concept of [[utility]] and gave [[Marginal rate of substitution|marginal rates of substitution]] a more fundamental role in analysis.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Marginalism is an integral part of [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] theory.

== Important marginal concepts ==

=== Marginality ===
For issues of marginality, constraints are conceptualized as a ''border'' or ''margin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her ''endowment'', broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a [[marginal value|''marginal'' value]].  A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a ''marginal'' change.

Neoclassical economics usually assumes that marginal changes are [[infinitesimal]]s or [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]]. (Though this assumption makes the analysis less robust, it increases tractability.) One is therefore often told that "marginal" is synonymous with "very small", though in more general analysis this may not be operationally true (and would not in any case be literally true).  Frequently, economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a resource, because decisions are often made in terms of units; marginalism seeks to explain unit prices in terms of such marginal values.

=== Marginal use ===
{{main|Marginal use}}
The '''marginal use''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalism assumes, for any given agent, [[Rational choice theory|economic rationality]] and an [[Order theory|ordering]] of possible states-of-the-world, such that, for any given set of constraints, there is an attainable state which is best in the eyes of that agent.  [[Positive science|Descriptive]] marginalism asserts that choice amongst the specific means by which various anticipated specific states-of-the-world (outcomes) might be affected is governed only by the distinctions amongst those specific outcomes; [[Normative economics|prescriptive]] marginalism asserts that such choice ''ought'' to be so governed.

On such assumptions, each increase would be put to the specific, feasible, previously unrealized use of greatest priority, and each decrease would result in abandonment of the use of lowest priority amongst the uses to which the good or service had been put.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;

=== Marginal utility ===
{{main|Marginal utility}}
The '''marginal utility''' of a good or service is the utility of its [[marginal use]].  Under the assumption of economic rationality, it is the utility of its least urgent possible use ''from'' the best feasible combination of actions in which its use is included.

In 20th century [[mainstream economics]], the term "[[utility]]" has come to be formally defined as a ''[[Measure (mathematics)|quantification]]'' capturing preferences by assigning greater quantities to states, goods, services, or applications that are of higher priority.  But marginalism and the concept of marginal utility predate the establishment of this convention within economics.  The more general conception of utility is that of ''use'' or ''usefulness'', and this conception is at the heart of marginalism; the term "marginal utility" arose from translation of the German "Grenznutzen",&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wieser_zwei"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Der natürliche Werth'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Natural Value''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1889), Bk I Ch V "Marginal Utility" ([http://praxeology.net/FW-NV-I-5.htm HTML]).&lt;/ref&gt; which literally means ''border use'', referring directly to the marginal use, and the more general formulations of marginal utility do not treat quantification as an ''essential'' feature.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; "The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility", ''[[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]]'' 37 (1973) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, none of the early marginalists insisted that utility were ''not'' quantified,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; "The Development of Utility Theory" ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; "The Adoption of Marginal Utility Theory" ''History of Political Economy'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; some indeed treated quantification as an essential feature, and those who did not still used an assumption of quantification for expository purposes.  In this context, it is not surprising to find many presentations that fail to recognize a more general approach.

==== Quantified marginal utility ====
Under the [[special case]] in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=U(S_2)-U(S_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are distinguishable by values of just one variable &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; to the size of that change:
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
(where “[[ceteris paribus|c.p.]]” indicates that the ''only'' [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] to change is &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta g\to 0}{\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}}&lt;/math&gt;
is well defined, and use “marginal utility” to refer to a [[partial derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial g}\approx\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;

==== The "law" of diminishing marginal utility ====
The "law" of diminishing marginal utility (also known as a "[[Hermann Heinrich Gossen|Gossen]]'s First Law") is that, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', as additional amounts of a good or service are added to available resources, their marginal utilities are decreasing.  This "law" is sometimes treated as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], sometimes as something proven by introspection, or sometimes as a mere [[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] assumption, adopted only for its perceived predictive efficacy.  Actually, it is not quite any of these things, though it may have aspects of each.  The "law" does not hold under all circumstances, so it is neither a tautology nor otherwise proveable; but it has a basis in prior observation.

An individual will typically be able to [[Partially ordered set|partially order]] the potential uses of a good or service.  If there is [[scarcity]], then a rational agent will satisfy wants of highest possible priority, so that no want is avoidably sacrificed to satisfy a want of ''lower'' priority.  In the absence of complementarity across the uses, this will imply that the priority of use of any additional amount will be lower than the priority of the established uses, as in this famous example:
:A pioneer farmer had five sacks of grain, with no way of selling them or buying more. He had five possible uses: as basic feed for himself, food to build strength, food for his chickens for dietary variation, an ingredient for making whisky and feed for his parrots to amuse him. Then the farmer lost one sack of grain. Instead of reducing every activity by a fifth, the farmer simply starved the parrots as they were of less utility than the other four uses; in other words they were on the margin. And it is on the margin, and not with a view to the big picture, that we make economic decisions.&lt;ref name="bawerk_capital"&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Marginal-utility.png|thumb|right|Diminishing marginal utility, given quantification]]
However, if there ''is'' a complementarity across uses, then an amount added can bring things past a desired tipping point, or an amount subtracted cause them to fall short.  In such cases, the marginal utility of a good or service might actually be ''increasing''.

Without the presumption that utility is quantified, the ''diminishing'' of utility should not be taken to be itself an [[Elementary arithmetic|arithmetic]] [[subtraction]].  It is the movement from use of higher to lower priority, and may be no more than a purely [[Ranking|ordinal]] change.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Theodore-Angwenyi, Nicholas]]; "Utility", ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

When quantification of utility is assumed, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to a utility function whose ''[[slope]]'' is continually or continuously decreasing.  In the latter case, if the function is also smooth, then the “law” may be expressed
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial g^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
Neoclassical economics usually supplements or supplants discussion of marginal utility with [[indifference curve]]s, which were originally derived as the [[level curve]]s of utility functions,&lt;ref name="edgeworth"&gt;Edgeworth, Francis Ysidro; [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics''] (1881).&lt;/ref&gt; or can be produced without presumption of quantification,&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt; but are often simply treated as axiomatic.  In the absence of complementarity of goods or services, diminishing marginal utility implies [[Convex function|convexity]] of indifference curves&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edgeworth" /&gt; (though such convexity would also follow from [[quasiconcavity]] of the utility function).

=== Marginal rate of substitution ===
{{Main|Marginal rate of substitution}}
The ''rate of substitution'' is the ''least favorable'' rate at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.  The '''''marginal''''' '''rate of substitution''' ("MRS") is the rate of substitution at the margin&amp;nbsp;– in other words, given some constraint(s).

When goods and services are [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]], the least favorable rate at which an agent would trade A for B will usually be different from that at which she would trade B for A:
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{AB} \neq \frac1{MRS_{BA}}&lt;/math&gt;
But, when the goods and services are continuously divisible, in the [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]]
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{AB} = \frac1{MRS_{BA}}&lt;/math&gt;
and the marginal rate of substitution is the slope of the [[indifference curve]] (multiplied by &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;).

If, for example, Lisa will not trade a goat for anything less than two sheep, then her
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{SG} = \frac{2\text{ sheep}}\text{goat}&lt;/math&gt;
And if she will not trade a sheep for anything less than two goats, then her
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{GS} = \frac{2\text{ goat}}\text{sheep} \neq \frac{1\text{ goat}}{2\text{ sheep}} = \frac1{\left(\frac{2\text{ sheep}}\text{goat}\right)} = \frac1{MRS_{SG}}&lt;/math&gt;
But if she would trade one gram of banana for one ounce of ice cream ''and vice versa'', then
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{IB} = \frac{1\text{ oz ice cream}}{1\text{ g banana}} = \frac1{\left(\frac{1\text{ g banana}}{1\text{ oz ice cream}}\right)} = \frac1{MRS_{BI}}&lt;/math&gt;

When indifference curves (which are essentially graphs of instantaneous rates of substitution) and the convexity of those curves are not taken as given, the "law" of diminishing marginal utility is invoked to explain diminishing marginal rates of substitution&amp;nbsp;– a willingness to accept fewer units of good or service &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in substitution for &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as one's holdings of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; grow relative to those of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  If an individual has a stock or flow of a good or service whose marginal utility is less than would be that of some other good or service for which he or she could trade, then it is in his or her interest to effect that trade.  Of course, as one thing is traded-away and another is acquired, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades are now changed.  On the assumption that the marginal utility of one is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other.  In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;) If any trader can better his or her own marginal position by offering an exchange more favorable to other traders with desired goods or services, then he or she will do so.

=== Marginal cost ===

At the highest level of generality, a '''marginal cost''' is a marginal [[opportunity cost]].  In most contexts, however, "marginal cost" will refer to marginal ''[[Money|pecuniary]]'' cost&amp;nbsp;– that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

A thorough-going marginalism sees marginal cost as increasing under the "law" of diminishing marginal utility, because applying resources to one application reduces their availability to other applications.  Neoclassical economics tends to disregard this argument, but to see marginal costs as increasing in consequence of [[diminishing returns]].

== Application to price theory ==
Marginalism and neoclassical economics typically explain price formation broadly through the interaction of [[supply and demand|curves or schedules of supply and demand]].  In any case buyers are modelled as pursuing typically lower quantities, and sellers offering typically higher quantities, as price is increased, with each being willing to trade until the marginal value of what they would trade-away exceeds that of the thing for which they would trade.

=== Demand ===
Demand curves are explained by marginalism in terms of marginal rates of substitution.

At any given price, a prospective buyer has some marginal rate of substitution of money for the good or service in question.  Given the "law" of diminishing marginal utility, or otherwise given convex indifference curves, the rates are such that the willingness to forgo money for the good or service decreases as the buyer would have ever more of the good or service and ever less money.  Hence, any given buyer has a demand schedule that generally decreases in response to price (at least until quantity demanded reaches zero).  The aggregate quantity demanded by all buyers is, at any given price, just the sum of the quantities demanded by individual buyers, so it too decreases as price increases.

=== Supply ===
Both neoclassical economics and thorough-going marginalism could be said to explain supply curves in terms of marginal cost; however, there are marked differences in conceptions of that cost.

Marginalists in the tradition of [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] and neoclassical economists tend to represent the supply curve for any producer as a curve of marginal pecuniary costs objectively determined by physical processes, with an upward slope determined by [[diminishing returns]].

A more thorough-going marginalism represents the supply curve as a ''complementary demand curve''&amp;nbsp;–  where the demand is ''for'' money and the purchase is made ''with'' a good or service.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Pt IV Ch 6 §4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The shape of that curve is then determined by marginal rates of substitution of money for that good or service.

=== Markets ===
By confining themselves to limiting cases in which sellers or buyers are both "price takers"&amp;nbsp;– so that demand functions ignore supply functions or ''vice versa''&amp;nbsp;– Marshallian marginalists and neoclassical economists produced tractable models of [[Perfect competition|"pure" or "perfect" competition]] and of various forms of [[Imperfect competition|"imperfect" competition]], which models are usually captured by relatively simple graphs.  Other marginalists have sought to present what they thought of as more realistic explanations,&lt;ref&gt;Mund, Vernon Arthur; ''Monopoly: A History and Theory'' (1933).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mises, Ludwig Heinrich Edler von]]; [http://library.mises.org/books/Ludwig%20von%20Mises/Nationalokonomie%20Theorie%20des%20Handelns%20und%20Wirtschaftens.pdf ''Nationalökonomie: Theorie des Handelns und Wirtschaftens''] (1940). (See also his [https://mises.org/books/humanaction.pdf ''Human Action''.])&lt;/ref&gt; but this work has been relatively uninfluential on the mainstream of economic thought.

=== The paradox of water and diamonds ===
{{main|Paradox of value}}
The "law" of diminishing marginal utility is said to explain the "paradox of water and diamonds", most commonly associated with [[Adam Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam; ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Chapter IV. "Of the Origin and Use of Money".&lt;/ref&gt; (though recognized by earlier thinkers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Scott|last = Gordon|year = 1991|title = History and Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter = The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century|publisher = [[Routledge]]|isbn = 0-415-09670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human beings cannot even survive without water, whereas diamonds, in Smith's day, were ornamentation or engraving bits. Yet water had a very small price, and diamonds a very large price. Marginalists explained that it is the ''marginal'' usefulness of any given quantity that matters, rather than the usefulness of a ''class'' or of a ''totality''.  For most people, water was sufficiently abundant that the loss or gain of a gallon would withdraw or add only some very minor use if any, whereas diamonds were in much more restricted supply, so that the loss or gain was much greater.

That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual.  Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

=== Proto-marginalist approaches ===
Perhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], wherein he writes {{Quotation|external goods have a limit, like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a nature that where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics'', Bk 7 Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle's' value theory.&lt;ref&gt;Soudek, Josef; “Aristotle's Theory of Exchange: An Inquiry into the Origin of Economic Analysis”, ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' v 96 (1952) pp. 45–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kauder"&gt;Kauder, Emil; “Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory from Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century”, ''Economic Journal'' v 63 (1953) pp. 638–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Barry Lewis John; “Aristotle and the Development of Value Theory”, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' v 78 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schumArist"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Part II Chapter 1 §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, Scott; ''Aristotle's Economic Thought'' (1995) Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;)

A great variety of economists concluded that there was ''some'' sort of inter-relationship between utility and rarity that effected economic decisions, and in turn informed the determination of prices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Přibram|Přibram, Karl]]; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century Italian [[Mercantilism|mercantilists]], such as [[Antonio Genovesi]], [[Giammaria Ortes]], [[Pietro Verri]], [[Cesare Beccaria]], and [[Giovanni Rinaldo]], held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted.&lt;ref name="pribramItalMerc"&gt;Pribram, Karl; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983), Chapter 5 “Refined Mercantilism”, “Italian Mercantilists”.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Della Moneta]]'' (1751), Abbé [[Ferdinando Galiani]], a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, ''utility'' and ''scarcity'', with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.

[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], in ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse'' (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.

Like the Italian mercantilists, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belongs, and by estimated scarcity.  In ''De commerce et le gouvernement'' (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.

This last point was famously restated by the Nineteenth Century proto-marginalist, [[Richard Whately]], who in ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy'' (1832) wrote {{Quotation|It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy, Being part of a course delivered in the Easter term'' (1832).&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Whately's student [[Nassau William Senior]] is noted below as an early marginalist.)

[[Frédéric Bastiat]] in chapters V and XI of his ''Economic Harmonies'' (1850) also develops a theory of value as ratio between services that increment utility, rather than between total utility.

=== Marginalists before the Revolution ===
The first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], in "Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis".&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; "Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis" in ''Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'' 5 (1738); reprinted in translation as "Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk" in ''Econometrica'' 22 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; letter of 4 July 1731 to Nicolas Bernoulli ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Nicolas; letter of 5 April 1732, acknowledging receipt of "Specimen theoriae novae metiendi sortem pecuniariam" ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]] produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Garbriel; letter of 21 May 1728 to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicolaus Bernoulli]] ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each had sought to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the [[natural logarithm]] (Bernoulli) or [[square root]] (Cramer) thereof.  However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.

In "A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange",&lt;ref&gt;Finally some recognition that the guidance isn't clear.&lt;/ref&gt; delivered in 1833 and included in ''Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent'' (1837), [[William Forster Lloyd]] explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications.  The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman|Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson]]; "On some neglected British economists", ''Economic Journal'' v. 13 (September 1903).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Outline of the Science of Political Economy'' (1836), [[Nassau William Senior]] asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;White, Michael V; "Diamonds Are Forever(?): Nassau Senior and Utility Theory" in ''The Manchester School of Economic &amp;amp; Social Studies'' 60 (1992) #1 (March).&lt;/ref&gt;

In "De la mesure de l'utilité des travaux publics" (1844), [[Jules Dupuit]] applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuit, Jules; "De la mesure de l'utilité des travaux publics", ''Annales des ponts et chaussées'', Second series, 8 (1844).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] published ''Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln'', which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy.  However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.

=== The Marginal Revolution ===
Marginalism as a formal theory can be attributed to the work of three economists, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in England, [[Carl Menger|Menger]] in Austria, and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] in Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[William Stanley Jevons]] first proposed the theory in articles in 1863 and 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/jevons/mathem.txt “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”] ([http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~hmcleave/jevonsmath.pdf PDF]), ''The Theory of Political Economy'' (1871).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Carl Menger]] presented the theory in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'' (translated as [https://mises.org/document/595 ''Principles of Economics'' PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;  Menger explained why individuals use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs, but while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.{{vague|date=July 2012}}&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"/&gt;
[[Léon Walras]] introduced the theory in ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'', the first part of which was published in 1874. (American [[John Bates Clark]] is also associated with the origins of Marginalism, but did little to advance the theory.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==== The second generation ====
Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists.  In England, the second generation were exemplified by [[Philip Wicksteed]], by [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]], and by [[Alfred Marshall]]; in Austria by [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] and by [[Friedrich von Wieser]]; in Switzerland by [[Vilfredo Pareto]]; and in America by [[Herbert Joseph Davenport]] and by [[Frank Fetter|Frank A. Fetter]].

There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines.  The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras.  Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger.  Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of "the American Psychological School", named in imitation of the Austrian "Psychological School". (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.)  William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.&lt;ref name="salerno"&gt;Salerno, Joseph T. 1999; "The Place of Mises's Human Action in the Development of Modern Economic Thought". ''Quarterly Journal of Economic Thought'' v. 2 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception.&lt;ref name="salerno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von. "Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerthes", ''Jahrbüche für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'' v 13 (1886).  Translated as ''Basic Principles of Economic Value''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing [[marginal product]]ivity of time and with [[time preference]].&lt;ref name="bawerk_capital"/&gt; (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by [[Knut Wicksell]]&lt;ref&gt;Wicksell, Johan Gustaf Knut; ''Über Wert, Kapital unde Rente'' (1893). Translated as [https://mises.org/books/valuecapital.pdf ''Value, Capital and Rent''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival [[Irving Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving; ''Theory of Interest'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Marshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his ''Principles of Economics'', the first volume of which was published in 1890.  Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so).  Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he paired a marginal explanation of demand with a more [[Classical economics|classical]] explanation of supply, wherein costs were taken to be objectively determined.  (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis" /&gt;)

==== The Marginal Revolution as a response to socialism ====
The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as a response to the rise of the worker's movement, [[Marxian economics]] and the earlier [[Ricardian socialism|(Ricardian) socialist]] theories of the [[exploitation of labour]]. The first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' was not published until July 1867, when marginalism was already developing, but before the advent of Marxian economics, proto-marginalist ideas such as those of Gossen had largely fallen on deaf ears. It was only in the 1880s, when Marxism had come to the fore as the main economic theory of the workers' movement, that Gossen found (posthumous) recognition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Outline of the History of Economic Theory|last=Screpanti|first=Ernesto|last2=Zamagni|first2=Stefano|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=170-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the rise of Marxism, E. Screpanti and S. Zamagni point to a different 'external' reason for marginalism's success, which is its successful response to the [[Long Depression]] and the resurgence of [[class conflict]] in all developed capitalist economies after the 1848-1870 period of social peace. Marginalism, Screpanti and Zamagni argue, offered a theory of the [[Perfect competition|free market as perfect]], as performing optimal allocation of resources, while it allowed economists to blame any adverse effects of laissez-faire economics on the interference of workers' coalitions in the proper functioning of the market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Scholars have suggested that the success of the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution was their ability to formulate straightforward responses to [[Marxist economic theory]].&lt;ref name="screpanti"&gt;Screpanti, Ernesto, and Stefano Zamagni; ''An Outline of the History of Economic Thought'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, “Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems” (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; “Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems” [“On the Closure of the Marxist System”], ''Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für [[Karl Knies|K. Knies]]'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; but the first was Wicksteed's “The Marxian Theory of Value. ''Das Kapital'': a criticism” (1884,&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; “Das Kapital: A Criticism”, ''To-day'' 2 (1884) pp. 388–409.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by “The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder” in 1885&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; “The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder”, ''To-day'' 3 (1885) pp. 177–79.&lt;/ref&gt;). The most famous early Marxist responses were [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904)&lt;ref name="hilferding"&gt;Hilferding, Rudolf; ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904).  Translated as ''Böhm-Bawerk's Criticism of Marx''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class'' (1914) by [[Nikolai Bukharin]].&lt;ref name="bukharin"&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin]]; ''Политической экономии рантье'' (1914).  Translated as [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eclipse ===
In his 1881 work ''Mathematical Psychics'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] presented the [[indifference curve]], deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services.  But it came to be seen that indifference curves could be considered as somehow ''given'', without bothering with notions of utility.

In 1915, [[Eugen Slutsky]] derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Slutsky]]; "Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore", ''Giornale degli Economisti'' 51 (1915).&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of [[World War I|the World War]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by [[John Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, John Richard, and Roy George Douglas Allen; "A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value", ''Economica'' 54 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)

Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility,&lt;ref&gt;[[von Mises, Ludwig Heinrich]]; ''[[Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel]]'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity.  Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way of dispensing with presumptions of quantification, albeït that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a "rabbit out of a hat"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §8, p. 23 in the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution&lt;ref name="hicks_vc"&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.

For those who accepted that superseded marginal utility analysis had been superseded by indifference curve analysis, the former became at best somewhat analogous to the [[Bohr model|Bohr model of the atom]]—perhaps pedagogically useful, but “old fashioned” and ultimately incorrect.&lt;ref name="hicks_vc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="samuelson"&gt;Samuelson, Paul Anthony; "Complementarity: An Essay on the 40th Anniversary of the Hicks-Allen Revolution in Demand Theory", ''Journal of Economic Literature'' vol 12 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
When Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address [[St. Petersburg paradox|a paradox of gambling]], rather than the [[paradox of value]].  The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither [[risk]] nor [[uncertainty]].  So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.

The [[expected utility hypothesis]] of Bernoulli ''et alii'' was revived by various 20th century thinkers, including [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Frank Plumpton; “Truth and Probability” ([http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf  PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227205205/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }}), Chapter VII in ''The Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] (1944),&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John and Oskar Morgenstern; ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Leonard Savage]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Leonard Jimmie; ''Foundations of Statistics'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not merely utility but a quantified conception thereof back into the mainstream of economic thought, and would dispatch the [[Occam's razor|Ockhamistic argument]].&lt;ref name="samuelson" /&gt; (It should perhaps be noted that, in expected utility analysis, the “law” of diminishing marginal utility corresponds to what is called “[[risk aversion]]”.)

== Criticisms==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Economics]] --&gt;

=== Marxist criticisms of marginalism ===
{{main|Marxist economic theory}}
[[Karl Marx]] died before marginalism became the interpretation of economic value accepted by mainstream economics.  His theory was based on the [[labor theory of value]], which distinguishes between [[exchange value]] and [[use value]]. In his ''Capital'' he rejected the explanation of long-term market values by supply and demand:
:Nothing is easier than to realize the inconsistencies of demand and supply, and the resulting deviation of market-prices from market-values. The real difficulty consists in determining what is meant by the equation of supply and demand.
:[...]
:If supply equals demand, they cease to act, and for this very reason commodities are sold at their market-values. Whenever two forces operate equally in opposite directions, they balance one another, exert no outside influence, and any phenomena taking place in these circumstances must be explained by causes other than the effect of these two forces. If supply and demand balance one another, they cease to explain anything, do not affect market-values, and therefore leave us so much more in the dark about the reasons why the market-value is expressed in just this sum of money and no other.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch10.htm ''Capital'' v. III pt. II ch. 10].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early response to marginalism, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] argued that "the subjective evaluation from which price is to be derived really starts from this price",&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Bukharin (1914) ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class'', Chapter 3, Section 2. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ch03.htm#s6].&lt;/ref&gt; concluding:

:Whenever the Böhm-Bawerk theory, it appears, resorts to individual motives as a basis for the derivation of social phenomena, he is actually smuggling in the social content in a more or less disguised form in advance, so that the entire construction becomes a vicious circle, a continuous logical fallacy, a fallacy that can serve only specious ends, and demonstrating in reality nothing more than the complete barrenness of modern bourgeois theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholai Bukharin (1914) ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class'', Chapter 3, Section 6. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ch03.htm#s6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly a later Marxist critic, [[Ernest Mandel]], argued that marginalism was "divorced from reality", ignored the role of production, and that:
:It is, moreover, unable to explain how, from the clash of millions of different individual "needs" there emerge not only uniform prices, but prices which remain stable over long periods, even under perfect conditions of free competition. Rather than an explanation of constants, and of the basic evolution of economic life, the "marginal" technique provides at best an explanation of ephemeral, short-term variations.&lt;ref&gt;Mandel, Ernest; ''Marxist Economic Theory'' (1962), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/works/marxist-economic-theory/marginalists.htm “The marginalist theory of value and neo-classical political economy”].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Dobb]] argued that prices derived through marginalism depend on the distribution of income.  The ability of consumers to express their preferences is dependent on their spending power.   As the theory asserts that prices arise in the act of exchange, Dobb argues that it cannot explain how the distribution of income affects prices and consequently cannot explain prices.&lt;ref name="dobb"&gt;Dobb, Maurice; ''Theories of value and Distribution'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobb also criticized the ''motives'' behind marginal utility theory.  Jevons wrote, for example, "so far as is consistent with the inequality of wealth in every community, all commodities are distributed by exchange so as to produce the maximum social benefit." (See  [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics]].) Dobb contended that this statement indicated that marginalism is intended to insulate market economics from criticism by making prices the natural result of the given income distribution.&lt;ref name="dobb" /&gt;

=== Marxist adaptations to marginalism ===
Some economists strongly influenced by the [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] tradition such as [[Oskar Lange]], [[Włodzimierz Brus]], and [[Michał Kalecki]] have attempted to integrate the insights of classical [[political economy]], marginalism, and [[neoclassical economics]]. They believed that Marx lacked a sophisticated theory of prices, and neoclassical economics lacked a theory of the social frameworks of economic activity.  Some other Marxists have also argued that on one level there is no conflict between marginalism and Marxism: one could employ a marginalist theory of supply and demand within the context of a “big picture” understanding of the Marxist notion that capitalists exploit [[surplus labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Steedman, Ian; ''Socialism &amp; Marginalism in Economics, 1870–1930'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mental image''' or '''mental picture''' is the representation in a person's mind of the physical world outside that person.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W. (2012). Fundamentals of cognition, 2nd ed. New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an experience that, on most occasions, significantly resembles the experience of perceiving some object, event, or scene, but occurs when the relevant object, event, or scene is not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;McKellar, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finke, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  There are sometimes episodes, particularly on falling asleep ([[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic imagery]]) and waking up ([[hypnopompic]]), when the mental imagery, being of a rapid, phantasmagoric and involuntary character, defies perception, presenting a kaleidoscopic field, in which no distinct object can be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Edmond |year=1983 |title=Inspecting images |journal=Philosophy |volume=58 |issue=223 |pages=57–72 (see pp. 68–72) |doi=10.1017/s0031819100056266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental imagery can sometimes produce the same effects as would be produced by the behavior or experience imagined.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappes|first=Heather Barry|last2=Morewedge|first2=Carey K.|date=2016-07-01|title=Mental Simulation as Substitute for Experience|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=10|issue=7|pages=405–420|doi=10.1111/spc3.12257|issn=1751-9004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of these experiences, what makes them possible, and their function (if any) have long been subjects of research and controversy{{Elucidate|date=April 2014}} in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], and, more recently, [[neuroscience]]. As contemporary researchers{{whom2|date=April 2014}} use the expression, mental images or imagery can comprise information from any source of sensory input; one may experience auditory images,&lt;ref&gt;Reisberg, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; olfactory images,&lt;ref&gt;Bensafi et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and so forth. However, the majority of philosophical and scientific investigations of the topic focus upon ''visual'' mental imagery. It has sometimes been assumed{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that, like humans, some types of animals are capable of experiencing mental images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]]: ''[[On the Soul]]'' III.3 428a&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fundamentally introspective nature of the phenomenon, there is little to no evidence either for or against this view.

Philosophers such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], and early experimental psychologists such as [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[William James]], understood [[idea]]s in general to be mental images. Today it is very widely believed{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that much imagery functions as mental representations (or [[mental model]]s), playing an important role in memory and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Paivio|Pavio]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Egan]], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence W. Barsalou|Barsalou]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; William Brant (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;12) traces the scientific use of the phrase "mental images" back to [[John Tyndall]]'s 1870 speech called the "Scientific Use of the Imagination". Some have gone so far as to suggest that images are best understood to be, by definition, a form of inner, mental or neural representation;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ned Block|Block]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Kosslyn|Kosslyn]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of hypnagogic and hypnapompic imagery, it is not representational at all.  Others reject the view that the image experience may be identical with (or directly caused by) any such representation in the mind or the brain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sartre]], 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Ryle|Ryle]], 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomeo, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett &amp; Hacker, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but do not take account of the non-representational forms of imagery.

In 2010, [[IBM]] applied for a patent on a method to extract mental images of human faces from the human brain. It uses a feedback loop based on brain measurements of the [[fusiform face area]] in the brain that activates proportionate with degree of facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20100049076.pdf IBM Patent Application: Retrieving mental images of faces from the human brain]&lt;/ref&gt; It was issued in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-traders.com/INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS-MA-4828/news/Business-Machines--Patent-Issued-for-Retrieving-Mental-Images-of-Faces-from-the-Human-Brain-20127314/ Business Machines : Patent Issued for Retrieving Mental Images of Faces from the Human Brain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mind's eye==
The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s reference to '''''mentis oculi''''' during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of [[simile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XCU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA535#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Liber III: XLI: 163.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to "the [[Gulf of Gabès|Syrtis]] of his patrimony" and "the [[Charybdis]] of his possessions" involved similes that were "too far-fetched"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of "the rock" and "the gulf" (respectively)—on the grounds that "the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ciceroonoratorya00ciceuoft#page/239/mode/1upWatson, J.S. (trans. and ed.), ''Cicero on Oratory and Orators'', Harper &amp; Brothers, (New York), 1875:  Book III, C.XLI, p.239.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "the mind's eye" first appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] (c. 1387) [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with "the eyes of his mind"; namely, those eyes "with which all men see after they have become blind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyprol00chauuoft#page/78/mode/1up ''The Man of Laws Tale'', lines 550-553.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical basis ==
The biological foundation of the mind's eye is not fully understood. Studies using [[fMRI]]  have shown that the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|V1 area]] of the [[visual cortex]] are activated during mental imagery tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~alumit/ishai_neuroimage2002.pdf Imagery of famous faces: effects of memory and attention revealed by fMRI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821220736/http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~alumit/ishai_neuroimage2002.pdf |date=2006-08-21 }}, A. Ishai, J. V. Haxby and L. G. Ungerleider, ''NeuroImage'' '''17''' (2002), pp. 1729-1741.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ratey|Ratey]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[visual pathway]] is not a one-way street. Higher areas of the [[human brain|brain]] can also send visual input back to [[neuron]]s in lower areas of the visual cortex. [...] As humans, we have the ability to see with the mind's eye – to have a perceptual experience in the absence of visual input. For example, [[PET scan]]s have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, imagine they are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the [[visual association cortex]], the [[parietal cortex]], and the [[prefrontal cortex]] - all higher [[Information processing theory#Cognitive processes|cognitive processing center]]s of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;''A User's Guide to the Brain'', John J. Ratey, {{ISBN|0-375-70107-9}}, at p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rudiments of a biological basis for the mind's eye is found in the deeper portions of the brain below the [[neocortex]], or where the center of perception exists.  The [[thalamus]] has been found to be discrete to other components in that it processes all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain.  Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the [[cerebral cortex]], the brain adapts to [[neuroplasticity]] to amend any occlusions for perception.  It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex.  This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate - essentially seeing something that isn't received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality).

Not all people have the same internal perceptual ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, some people are able to perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts.

Furthermore, the [[pineal gland]] is a hypothetical candidate for producing a mind's eye; [[Rick Strassman]] and others have postulated that during [[near-death experiences]] (NDEs) and [[dream]]ing, the gland might secrete a hallucinogenic chemical [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|''N'',''N''-Dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT) to produce internal visuals when external sensory data is occluded.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Strassman, DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences, 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89281-927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis has yet to be fully supported with [[neurochemical]] evidence and plausible mechanism for DMT production.

The hypothesized condition where a person lacks a mind's eye is called [[aphantasia]]. The term was first suggested in a 2015 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.05.019| pmid = 26115582| issn = 0010-9452| last1 = Zeman| first1 = Adam| last2 = Dewar| first2 = Michaela| last3 = Della Sala| first3 = Sergio| title = Lives without imagery – Congenital aphantasia| journal = Cortex| accessdate = 2015-06-24| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945215001781| volume=73| pages=378–380| year = 2015| hdl = 10871/17613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common examples of mental images include [[daydreaming]] and the mental visualization that occurs while reading a book. Another is of the pictures summoned by athletes during training or before a competition, outlining each step they will take to accomplish their goal.&lt;ref&gt;Plessinger, Annie. ''The Effects of Mental Imagery on Athletic Performance''. The Mental Edge. 12/20/13. Web. http://www.vanderbilt.edu&lt;/ref&gt; When a musician hears a song, he or she can sometimes "see" the song notes in their head, as well as hear them with all their tonal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia:  Tales of Music and the Brain |place=London |publisher=Picador |pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is considered different from an after-effect, such as an after-image.  Calling up an image in our minds can be a voluntary act, so it can be characterized as being under various degrees of conscious control.

According to psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1999). ''How the Mind Works''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; our experiences of the world are represented in our minds as mental images. These mental images can then be associated and compared with others, and can be used to synthesize completely new images. In this view, mental images allow us to form useful theories of how the world works by formulating likely sequences of mental images in our heads without having to directly experience that outcome. Whether [[animal cognition|other creatures have this capability]] is debatable.

There are several theories as to how mental images are formed in the mind. These include the [[dual coding theory|dual-code theory]], the propositional theory, and the functional-equivalency hypothesis. The dual-code theory, created by [[Allan Paivio]] in 1971, is the theory that we use two separate codes to represent information in our brains: image codes and verbal codes. Image codes are things like thinking of a picture of a dog when you are thinking of a dog, whereas a verbal code would be to think of the word "dog".&lt;ref&gt;Paivio, Allan. 1941. ''Dual Coding Theory. Theories of Learning in Educational Psychology''. (2013). Web. {{cite web |url=http://www.lifecircles-inc.com/Learningtheories/IP/paivio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221091503/http://www.lifecircles-inc.com/Learningtheories/IP/paivio.html |archivedate=2011-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the difference between thinking of abstract words such as ''justice'' or ''love'' and thinking of concrete words like ''elephant'' or ''chair.'' When abstract words are thought of, it is easier to think of them in terms of verbal codes—finding words that define them or describe them. With concrete words, it is often easier to use image codes and bring up a picture of a ''human'' or ''chair'' in your mind rather than words associated or descriptive of them.

The propositional theory involves storing images in the form of a generic propositional code that stores the meaning of the concept not the image itself. The propositional codes can either be descriptive of the image or symbolic. They are then transferred back into verbal and visual code to form the mental image.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Imaging Theories. 2013. Web. http://faculty.mercer.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional-equivalency hypothesis is that mental images are "internal representations" that work in the same way as the actual perception of physical objects.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W. (2012). ''Fundamentals of Cognition'', 2nd ed. New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the picture of a dog brought to mind when the word ''dog'' is read is interpreted in the same way as if the person looking at an actual dog before them.

Research has occurred to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show a multitude of results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in brodmann area 17.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi e21736"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Masayuki|last2=Sasabe|first2=Tetsuya|last3=Shigihara|first3=Yoshihito|last4=Tanaka|first4=Masaaki|last5=Watanabe|first5=Yasuyoshi|date=2011-07-08|title=Gustatory Imagery Reveals Functional Connectivity from the Prefrontal to Insular Cortices Traced with Magnetoencephalography|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e21736|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021736|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3132751|pmid=21760903|bibcode=2011PLoSO...621736K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial brodmann area 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meister|first=I.

==Neural substrates of visual imagery==
'''Visual imagery''' is the ability to create [[Mental image|mental representations]] of things, people, and places that are absent from an individual’s visual field. This ability is crucial to problem-solving tasks, memory, and spatial reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., &amp; van Gerven, M. A. J. [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/5/1367.abstract “Vividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas”], The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscientist|Neuroscientists]] have found that imagery and [[Perception|perception]] share many of the same [[Neural substrate|neural substrates]], or areas of the [[Brain|brain]] that function similarly during both imagery and perception, such as the [[Visual cortex|visual cortex]] and higher visual areas. Kosslyn and colleagues (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Pascual-Leone, A., Felician, O., Camposano, S., Keenan, J. P., L., W., … Alpert. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/284/5411/167.abstract “The Role of Area 17 in Visual Imagery: Convergent Evidence from PET and rTMS”], Science, 284(5411), 167 LP-170, (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the early visual cortex, Area 17 and Area 18/19, is activated during visual imagery. They found that inhibition of these areas through repetitive [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (rTMS) resulted in impaired visual perception and imagery. Furthermore, research conducted with lesioned patients has revealed that visual imagery and visual perception have the same representational organization. This has been concluded from patients in which impaired perception also experience visual imagery deficits at the same level of the mental representation.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, M. (1988). "Is Visual Imagery Really Visual? Overlooked Evidence From Neuropsychology". Psychological review. 95. 307-17. 10.1037/0033-295X.95.3.307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behrmann and colleagues (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Behrmann, M., Winocur, G., &amp; Moscovitch, M. [https://doi.org/10.1038/359636a0 “Dissociation between mental imagery and object recognition in a brain-damaged patient”]. Nature, 359, 636. (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; describe a patient C.K., who provided evidence challenging the view that visual imagery and visual perception rely on the same representational system. C.K. was a 33-year old man with [[Visual agnosia|visual object agnosia]] acquired after a vehicular accident. This deficit prevented him from being able to recognize objects and copy objects fluidly. Surprisingly, his ability to draw accurate objects from memory indicated his visual imagery was intact and normal. Furthermore, C.K. successfully performed other tasks requiring visual imagery for judgment of size, shape, color, and composition. These findings conflict with previous research as they suggest there is a partial dissociation between visual imagery and visual perception. C.K. exhibited a perceptual deficit that was not associated with a corresponding deficit in visual imagery, indicating that these two processes have systems for mental representations that may not be mediated entirely by the same neural substrates. 

Schlegel and colleagues (2013)&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, A., Kohler, P. J., Fogelson, S. V, Alexander, P., Konuthula, D., &amp; Tse, P. U. [http://www.pnas.org/content/110/40/16277.abstract “Network structure and dynamics of the mental workspace”], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(40), 16277 LP-16282. (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] analysis of regions activated during manipulation of visual imagery. They identified 11 bilateral [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and subcortical regions that exhibited increased activation when manipulating a visual image compared to when the visual image was just maintained. These regions included the [[Occipital lobe|occipital lobe]] and [[Two-streams hypothesis|ventral stream]] areas, two [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobe]] regions, the [[Posterior parietal cortex|posterior parietal cortex]] and the [[Precuneus|precuneus]] lobule, and three [[Frontal lobe|frontal lobe]] regions, the [[Frontal eye fields|frontal eye fields]], [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], and the [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal cortex]]. Due to their suspected involvement in [[Working memory|working memory]] and [[Attention|attention]], the authors propose that these parietal and prefrontal regions, and occipital regions, are part of a network involved in mediating the manipulation of visual imagery. These results suggest a top-down activation of visual areas in visual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, B., &amp; Whishaw, I. Q. (2015). Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology. New York. Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Dynamic causal modelling|Dynamic Causal Modeling]] (DCM) to determine the connectivity of cortical networks, Ishai et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Ishai, A. “Seeing faces and objects with the "mind's eye”", Archives Italiennes de Biologie, 148(1):1-9. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that activation of the network mediating visual imagery is initiated by prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex activity. Generation of objects from memory resulted in initial activation of the prefrontal and the posterior parietal areas, which then activate earlier visual areas through backward connectivity. Activation of the prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex has also been found to be involved in retrieval of object representations from [[Long-term memory|long-term memory]], their maintenance in working memory, and attention during visual imagery. Thus, Ishai et al. suggest that the network mediating visual imagery is composed of attentional mechanisms arising from the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex.

Vividness of visual imagery is a crucial component of an individual’s ability to perform cognitive tasks requiring imagery. Vividness of visual imagery varies not only between individuals but also within individuals. Dijkstra and colleagues (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., &amp; van Gerven, M. A. J. [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/5/1367.abstract “Vividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas”], The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; found that the variation in vividness of visual imagery is dependent on the degree to which the neural substrates of visual imagery overlap with those of visual perception. They found that overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual cortex, the parietal precuneus lobule, the right parietal cortex, and the medial frontal cortex predicted the vividness of a mental representation. The activated regions beyond the visual areas are believed to drive the imagery-specific processes rather than the visual processes shared with perception. It has been suggested that the precuneus contributes to vividness by selecting important details for imagery. The medial frontal cortex is suspected to be involved in the retrieval and integration of information from the parietal and visual areas during working memory and visual imagery. The right parietal cortex appears to be important in attention, visual inspection, and stabilization of mental representations. Thus, the neural substrates of visual imagery and perception overlap in areas beyond the visual cortex and the degree of this overlap in these areas correlates with the vividness of mental representations during imagery.

==Philosophical ideas==
{{Main|Mental representation}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Mental images are an important topic in classical and modern philosophy, as they are central to the study of [[knowledge]].  In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', Book VII, [[Plato]] has [[Socrates]] present the [[Allegory of the Cave]]: a prisoner, bound and unable to move, sits with his back to a fire watching the shadows cast on the cave wall in front of him by people carrying objects behind his back. These people and the objects they carry are representations of real things in the world. Unenlightened man is like the prisoner, explains  Socrates, a human being making mental images from the sense data that he experiences.

The eighteenth-century philosopher Bishop [[George Berkeley]] proposed similar ideas in his theory of [[idealism]].  Berkeley stated that reality is equivalent to mental images&amp;mdash;our mental images are not a copy of another material reality but that reality itself. Berkeley, however, sharply distinguished between the images that he considered to constitute the external world, and the images of individual imagination. According to Berkeley, only the latter are considered "mental imagery" in the contemporary sense of the term.

The eighteenth century British writer Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] criticized idealism.  When asked what he thought about idealism, he is alleged to have replied "I refute it thus!"{{Cite quote|date=February 2017}} as he kicked a large rock and his leg rebounded.  His point was that the idea that the rock is just another mental image and has no material existence of its own is a poor explanation of the painful sense data he had just experienced.

David Deutsch addresses Johnson's objection to idealism in ''The Fabric of Reality'' when he states that, if we judge the value of our mental images of the world by the quality and quantity of the sense data that they can explain, then the most valuable mental image&amp;mdash;or theory&amp;mdash;that we currently have is that the world has a real independent existence and that humans have successfully evolved by building up and adapting patterns of mental images to explain it.  This is an important idea in [[Philosophy of science|scientific thought]].{{Why|date=May 2010}}

Critics of [[scientific realism]] ask how the inner perception of mental images actually occurs. This is sometimes called the "[[homunculus]] problem" (see also the [[mind's eye]]). The problem is similar to asking how the images you see on a computer screen exist in the memory of the computer. To scientific [[materialism]], mental images and the perception of them must be brain-states. According to critics,{{Who|date=May 2010}} scientific realists cannot explain where the images and their perceiver exist in the brain. To use the analogy of the computer screen, these critics argue that [[cognitive science]] and [[psychology]] have been unsuccessful in identifying either the component in the brain (i.e., "hardware") or the mental processes that store these images (i.e. "software").

==In experimental psychology==

[[cognitive psychology|Cognitive psychologists]] and (later) [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscientists]] have empirically tested some of the philosophical questions related to whether and how the human brain uses mental imagery in cognition.

[[Image:MR TMR.jpg|right]]One theory of the mind that was examined in these experiments was the "brain as serial computer" philosophical metaphor of the 1970s. Psychologist [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] theorized that the human mind processes mental images by decomposing them into an underlying mathematical proposition. [[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler challenged that view by presenting subjects with 2D line drawings of groups of 3D block "objects" and asking them to determine whether that "object" is the same as a second figure, some of which rotations of the first "object".&lt;ref&gt;Shepard and Metzler 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Shepard and Metzler proposed that if we decomposed and then mentally re-imaged the objects into basic mathematical propositions, as the then-dominant view of cognition "as a serial digital computer"&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 1987&lt;/ref&gt; assumed, then it would be expected that the time it took to determine whether the object is the same or not would be independent of how much the object had been rotated.  Shepard and Metzler found the opposite: a linear relationship between the degree of rotation in the mental imagery task and the time it took participants to reach their answer.

This [[mental rotation]] finding implied that the human mind—and the human brain—maintains and manipulates mental images as topographic and topological wholes, an implication that was quickly put to test by psychologists.  [[Stephen Kosslyn]] and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn 1995; see also 1994&lt;/ref&gt; showed in a series of neuroimaging experiments that the mental image of objects like the letter "F" are mapped, maintained and rotated as an image-like whole in areas of the human visual cortex.  Moreover, Kosslyn's work showed that there are considerable similarities between the neural mappings for imagined stimuli and perceived stimuli.  The authors of these studies concluded that, while the neural processes they studied rely on mathematical and computational underpinnings, the brain also seems optimized to handle the sort of mathematics that constantly computes a series of topologically-based images rather than calculating a mathematical model of an object.

Recent studies in neurology and neuropsychology on mental imagery have further questioned the "mind as serial computer" theory, arguing instead that human mental imagery manifests [[motor imagery|both visually and kinesthetically]].  For example, several studies have provided evidence that people are slower at rotating line drawings of objects such as hands in directions incompatible with the joints of the human body,&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 1987; 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and that patients with painful, injured arms are slower at mentally rotating line drawings of the hand from the side of the injured arm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwoebel et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists, including Kosslyn, have argued that such results occur because of interference in the brain between distinct systems in the brain that process the visual and motor mental imagery.  Subsequent [[neuroimaging]] studies&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the interference between the motor and visual imagery system could be induced by having participants physically handle actual 3D blocks glued together to form objects similar to those depicted in the line-drawings.  Amorim et al. have shown that, when a cylindrical "head" was added to Shepard and Metzler's line drawings of 3D block figures, participants were quicker and more accurate at solving mental rotation problems.&lt;ref&gt;Amorim et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that motoric embodiment is not just "interference" that inhibits visual mental imagery but is capable of facilitating mental imagery.

As cognitive neuroscience approaches to mental imagery continued, research expanded beyond questions of serial versus parallel or topographic processing to questions of the relationship between mental images and perceptual representations. Both brain imaging (fMRI and ERP) and studies of neuropsychological patients have been used to test the hypothesis that a mental image is the reactivation, from memory, of brain representations normally activated during the perception of an external stimulus. In other words, if perceiving an apple activates contour and location and shape and color representations in the brain’s visual system, then imagining an apple activates some or all of these same representations using information stored in memory. Early evidence for this idea came from neuropsychology. Patients with brain damage that impairs perception in specific ways, for example by damaging shape or color representations, seem to generally to have impaired mental imagery in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J.|title=Is visual imagery really visual? Overlooked evidence from neuropsychology|journal=Psychological Review|date=Sep 30, 1987|volume=95|issue=3|pages=307–317|doi=10.1037/0033.295X.95.3.307|pmid=3043530|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/95/3/307/|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of brain function in normal human brains support this same conclusion, showing activity in the brain’s visual areas while subjects imagined visual objects and scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cichy|first1=Radoslaw M.|last2=Heinzle|first2=Jakob|last3=Haynes|first3=John-Dylan|title=Imagery and Perception Share Cortical Representations of Content and Location|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=June 10, 2011|volume=22|issue=2|pages=372–380|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr106|url=http://psych.wisc.edu/postlab/readings/Cereb.%20Cortex-2012-Cichy-372-80.pdf|pmid=21666128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previously mentioned and numerous related studies have led to a relative consensus within [[cognitive science]], psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy on the neural status of mental images.  In general, researchers agree that, while there is no [[homunculus]] inside the head viewing these mental images, our brains do form and maintain mental images as image-like wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Rohrer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem of exactly how these images are stored and manipulated within the human brain, in particular within language and communication, remains a fertile area of study.

One of the longest-running research topics on the mental image has basis on the fact that people report large individual differences in the vividness of their images.  Special questionnaires have been developed to assess such differences, including the [[Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)]] developed by [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]]. Laboratory studies have suggested that the subjectively reported variations in imagery vividness are associated with different neural states within the brain and also different cognitive competences such as the ability to accurately recall information presented in pictures&lt;ref&gt;Marks, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Rodway, Gillies and Schepman used a novel long-term change detection task to determine whether participants with low and high vividness scores on the VVIQ2 showed any performance differences.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway, Gillies and Schepman 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Rodway et al. found that high vividness participants were significantly more accurate at detecting salient changes to pictures compared to low-vividness participants.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This replicated an earlier study.&lt;ref&gt;Gur and Hilgard 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have found that individual differences in VVIQ scores can be used to predict changes in a person's brain while visualizing different activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cui et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) was used to study the association between early visual cortex activity relative to the whole brain while participants visualized themselves or another person bench pressing or stair climbing. Reported image vividness correlates significantly with the relative fMRI signal in the visual cortex. Thus, individual differences in the vividness of visual imagery can be measured objectively.

Logie, Pernet, Buonocore and Della Sala (2011) used behavioural and fMRI data for mental rotation from individuals reporting vivid and poor imagery on the VVIQ. Groups differed in brain activation patterns suggesting that the groups performed the same tasks in different ways. These findings help to explain the lack of association previously reported between VVIQ scores and mental rotation performance.

==Training and learning styles==

Some [[Learning theory (education)|educational theorists]]{{Who|date=May 2010}} have drawn from the idea of mental imagery in their studies of [[learning styles]]. Proponents of these theories state that people often have learning processes that emphasize visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems of experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} According to these theorists, teaching in multiple overlapping sensory systems benefits learning, and they encourage teachers to use content and media that integrates well with the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems whenever possible.

Educational researchers have examined whether the experience of mental imagery affects the degree of learning. For example, imagining playing a 5-finger piano exercise (mental practice) resulted in a significant improvement in performance over no mental practice—though not as significant as that produced by physical practice.  The authors of the study stated that "mental practice alone seems to be sufficient to promote the modulation of neural circuits involved in the early stages of motor skill learning".&lt;ref&gt;Pascual-Leone et al. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualization and the Himalayan traditions==
In general, [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Bön]], and [[Tantra]] utilize sophisticated visualization or ''imaginal'' (in the language of [[Jean Houston]] of [[Transpersonal Psychology]]) processes in the [[thoughtform]] construction of the [[yidam]] [[sadhana]], [[kye-rim]], and [[dzog-rim]] modes of [[meditation]] and in the [[yantra]], [[thangka]], and [[mandala]] traditions, where holding the fully realized form in the mind is a prerequisite prior to creating an 'authentic' new art work that will provide a sacred support or foundation for deity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Dalai-Lama-at-MIT/dp/0674023196 The Dalai Lama at MIT] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/erosch2007-2.pdf Mental Imagery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229110116/http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/erosch2007-2.pdf |date=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Substitution effects ==
Mental imagery can act as a [[Substitute good|substitute]] for the imagined experience: Imagining an experience can evoke similar cognitive, physiological, and/or behavioral consequences as having the corresponding experience in reality. At least four classes of such effects have been documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Imagined experiences are attributed evidentiary value like physical evidence. 
# [[Mental practice of action|Mental practice]] can instantiate the same performance benefits as physical practice. 
# Imagined consumption of a food can reduce its actual consumption. 
# Imagined goal achievement  can reduce motivation for actual goal achievement.

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

In [[logic]], '''negation''', also called the '''logical complement''', is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] that takes a [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to another proposition "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", written &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (¬P), which is interpreted intuitively as being true when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, and false when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true. Negation is thus a unary (single-argument) [[logical connective]]. It may be applied as an operation on [[notion (philosophy)|notions]], [[proposition]]s, [[truth value]]s, or [[interpretation (logic)|semantic values]] more generally. In [[classical logic]], negation is normally identified with the [[truth function]] that takes ''truth'' to ''falsity'' and vice versa. In [[intuitionistic logic]], according to the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
No agreement exists as to the possibility of defining negation, as to its logical status, function, and meaning, as to its field of applicability..., and as to the interpretation of the negative judgment, (F.H.

''Classical negation'' is an  [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' when its operand is false and a value of ''false'' when its operand is true.  So, if statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "not P") would therefore be false; and conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is false, then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be true.

The [[truth table]] of &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;"
|- bgcolor="#ddeeff"
| &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; \neg P &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| True || False
|-
| False || True
|}

Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical consequence]] and &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is [[False_(logic)|absolute falsehood]]). Conversely, one can define &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;Q \land \neg Q&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical conjunction]]). The idea here is that any [[contradiction]] is false.  While these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic, they do not work in [[paraconsistent logic]], where contradictions are not necessarily false. In classical logic, we also get a further identity, &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical disjunction]].

Algebraically, classical negation corresponds to [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] in a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in a [[Heyting algebra]]. These algebras provide a [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|semantics]] for classical and intuitionistic logic respectively.

==Notation==
The negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is notated in different ways in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. Among these variants are the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="text-align:center" | Notation
! Plain Text
! Vocalization
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt;
| ¬p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\mathord{\sim} p&lt;/math&gt;
| ~p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;-p&lt;/math&gt;
| -p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | N''p''
|
| En ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;p'&lt;/math&gt;
| p'
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' prime,
 | ''p'' complement
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\overline{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| ̅p
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' bar,
 | Bar ''p''
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;!p&lt;/math&gt;
| !p
| {{unbulleted list
 | Bang ''p''
 | Not ''p''
 }}
|-
|}

The notation N''p'' is [[Polish_notation#Polish_notation_for_logic|Łukasiewicz notation]].

In [[Set theory#Basic concepts and notation|set theory]] &lt;math&gt;\setminus&lt;/math&gt; is also used to indicate 'not member of': &lt;math&gt;U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all members of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that are not members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

No matter how it is notated or [[List of logic symbols|symbolized]], the negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be read as "it is not the case that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", "not that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", or usually more simply as "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;".

==Properties==

===Double negation===

Within a system of [[classical logic]], double negation, that is, the negation of the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressed in symbolic terms, &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P \equiv P&lt;/math&gt;. In [[intuitionistic logic]], a proposition implies its double negation but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically, classical negation is called an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of period two.

However, in [[intuitionistic logic]] we do have the equivalence of &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \neg P \equiv \neg P&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, in the propositional case, a sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as [[Double-negation translation|Glivenko's theorem]].

===Distributivity===

[[De Morgan's laws]] provide a way of [[Distributive property|distributing]] negation over [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] :

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; and
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linearity===
Let &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denote the logical [[Exclusive or|xor]] operation. In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a linear function is one such that:

If there exists &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;f(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n) = a_0 \oplus (a_1 \land b_1) \oplus \dots \oplus (a_n \land b_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
for all &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the [[truth-value]] of the operation or it never makes a difference. Negation is a linear logical operator.

===Self dual===
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] a self dual function is one such that:

&lt;math&gt;f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = \neg f(\neg a_1, \dots, \neg a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for all
&lt;math&gt;a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Negation is a self dual logical operator.

==Rules of inference==
There are a number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in a [[natural deduction]] setting is to take as primitive rules of inference ''negation introduction'' (from a derivation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to both &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg Q&lt;/math&gt;, infer &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''), ''negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''ex falso quodlibet''), and ''double negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;). One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination.

Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must not be the case (i.e. &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the rule says that from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity.

Typically the intuitionistic negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;. Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction ([[conditional proof]]) and elimination ([[modus ponens]]). In this case one must also add as a primitive rule ''ex falso quodlibet''.

==Programming==
As in mathematics, negation is used in [[computer science]] to construct logical statements.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    if (!(r == t))
    {
         /*...statements executed when r does NOT equal t...*/
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The "&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;" signifies logical NOT in [[B (programming language)|B]], [[C Programming Language|C]], and languages with a C-inspired syntax such as [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Perl]], and [[PHP]]. "&lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;" is the operator used in [[ALGOL 60]], [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] and [[Seed7]]. Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages like [[PL/I]] and [[Ratfor]] use &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; for negation. Some modern computers and [[operating systems]] will display &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; on files encoded in [[ASCII]]. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from &lt;code&gt;if (!(r == t))&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;if (r != t)&lt;/code&gt;, which allows sometimes, when the compiler/interpreter is not able to optimize it, faster programs.

In computer science there is also ''bitwise negation''. This takes the value given and switches all the [[binary numeral system|binary]] 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.  See [[bitwise operation]].  This is often used to create [[signed number representations|ones' complement]] or "&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;" in C or C++ and [[two's complement]] (just simplified to "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" or the negative sign since this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negative value of the number) as it basically creates the opposite (negative value equivalent) or mathematical complement of the value (where both values are added together they create a whole).

To get the absolute (positive equivalent) value of a given integer the following would work as the "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" changes it from negative to positive (it is negative because "&lt;code&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt;" yields true)

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (x &lt; 0)
            return -x;
        else
            return x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

To demonstrate logical negation:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (!(x &lt; 0))
            return x;
        else
            return -x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code, i.e. will have identical results for any input (note that depending on the compiler used, the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ).

This convention occasionally surfaces in written speech, as computer-related [[slang]] for ''not''.  The phrase &lt;code&gt;!voting&lt;/code&gt;, for example, means "not voting".

==Kripke semantics==
In [[Kripke semantics]] where the semantic values of formulae are sets of [[possible world]]s, negation can be taken to mean [[set-theoretic complement]]ation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} (See also [[possible world semantics]].)

'''Negative and positive rights''' are [[rights]] that oblige either action (''positive rights'') or inaction (''negative rights''). These obligations may be of either a [[natural and legal rights|legal or moral]] character. The notion of positive and negative rights may also be applied to [[liberty rights]].

To take an example involving [[Party (law)|two parties in a court of law]]: Adrian has a ''negative right to x'' against Clay [[if and only if]] Clay is ''prohibited'' from acting upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. In contrast, Adrian has a ''positive right to x'' against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. A case in point, if Adrian has a ''negative right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian; while if Adrian has a ''positive right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian.

Rights considered ''negative rights'' may include [[civil and political rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]], life, [[property (ownership right)|private property]], freedom from [[violent crime]], [[freedom of religion]], ''[[habeas corpus]]'', a [[fair trial]], and freedom from [[slavery]].

Rights considered ''positive rights'', as initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist [[Karel Vasak]], may include other civil and political rights such as [[police]] protection of person and property and the [[right to counsel]], as well as [[economic, social and cultural rights]] such as [[right to food|food]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[public education]], [[employment]], [[national security]], [[military]], [[right to health|health care]], [[social security]], [[right to internet access|internet access]], and a minimum [[right to an adequate standard of living|standard of living]]. In the [[three generations of human rights|"three generations"]] account of human rights, negative rights are often associated with the first generation of rights, while positive rights are associated with the second and third generations.

Some philosophers (see criticisms) disagree that the negative-positive rights distinction is useful or valid.

==Overview==
Under the theory of positive and negative rights, a negative right is a right ''not to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group—a government, for example—usually in the form of abuse or [[coercion]].  As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to ''negate'' them. A positive right is a right ''to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group.  In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be ''added'' to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder. In the framework of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]], negative rights can be associated with [[Categorical imperative#Perfect duty|perfect duties]] while positive rights can be connected to [[Categorical imperative#Imperfect duty|imperfect duties]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Belief in a distinction between positive and negative rights is usually maintained, or emphasized, by [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s, who believe that positive rights do not exist until they are created by contract. The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] lists both positive and negative rights (but does not identify them as such). The constitutions of most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] guarantee negative rights, but not all include positive rights. Nevertheless, positive rights are often guaranteed by other laws, and the majority of liberal democracies provide their citizens with publicly funded education, health care, social security and [[unemployment benefit]]s.

==When they conflict==

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

Rights are often spoken of as [[natural rights|inalienable]] and sometimes even [[moral absolutism|absolute]]. However, in practice this is often taken as [[graded absolutism]]; rights are ranked by degree of importance, and violations of lesser ones are accepted in the course of preventing violations of greater ones. Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding obligation on others to refrain from killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: [[right of self-defense|self-defense]]. Certain widely accepted negative obligations (such as the obligations to refrain from theft, murder, etc.) are often considered [[prima facie]], meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted "on its face"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis.

Thus a thief may have a negative obligation not to steal, and a [[police officer]] may have a negative obligation not to tackle people&amp;mdash;but a police officer tackling the thief easily meets the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the (unarmed) thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The obligation not to kill&amp;mdash;being universally regarded as one of the highest, if not the highest obligation&amp;mdash;is so much greater than the obligation not to steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing.

Positive obligations confer duty. But as we see with the police officer, exercising a duty may violate negative obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics positive obligations are almost never considered ''[[prima facie]]''. The greatest negative obligation may have just one exception&amp;mdash;one higher obligation of self-defense&amp;mdash;but even the greatest positive obligations generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically in the case of [[triage]] after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that positive obligations are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably ''prima facie''. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because positive obligations are not reliably ''prima facie'' they must always be agreed to through contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html "Individual rights"], ''Ayn Rand Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying:
{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary." It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to [[Jan Narveson]], the view of some that there is no distinction between negative and positive rights on the ground that negative rights require police and courts for their enforcement is "mistaken". He says that the question between what one has a right to do and who if anybody enforces it are separate issues. If rights are only negative then it simply means no one has a duty to enforce them, although individuals have a right to use any non-forcible means to gain the cooperation of others in protecting those rights. Therefore, he says "the distinction between negative and positive is quite robust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Narveson - Libertarianism: A Philosophical Introduction|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210122955/http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|url=http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|author=Narveson, Jan|work=Against Politics|archivedate=February 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarians]] hold that positive rights, which would include a right to be protected, do not exist until they are created by contract. However, those who hold this view do not mean that police, for example, are not obligated to protect the rights of citizens. Since they contract with their employers to defend citizens from violence, then they have created that obligation to their employer. A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him, or obtain voluntary assistance from others to defend his life&amp;mdash;but he may not force others to defend him, because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.

Other advocates of the view that there is a distinction between negative and positive rights argue that the presence of a police force or army is not due to any positive right to these services that citizens claim, but rather because they are [[natural monopolies]] or [[public goods]]&amp;mdash;features of any human society that arise naturally, even while adhering to the concept of negative rights only. [[Robert Nozick]] discusses this idea at length in his book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.{{ref|nozick}}

===In medicine===
In the field of [[medicine]], positive rights of [[patient]]s often conflict with negative rights of [[physician]]s.  In controversial areas such as [[abortion]] and [[assisted suicide]], medical professionals may not wish to offer certain services for moral or philosophical reasons. If enough practitioners opt out as a result of conscience, a right granted by [[conscience clause]] statutes in many jurisdictions, patients may not have any means of having their own positive rights fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/do-we-need-a-pro-choice-l_b_178456.html|title=Do We Need a Pro-Choice Litmus Test for Obstetricians?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case of [[Janet Murdock]], a Montana woman who could not find any physician to assist her suicide in 2009.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/big-sky-dilemma-must-doct_b_275034.html|title=Big Sky Dilemma: Must Doctors Help Their Patients Die?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy over positive and negative rights in medicine has become a focal point in the ongoing public debate between conservative ethicist [[Wesley J. Smith]] and bioethicist [[Jacob M.

{{quote|Medical licenses are a limited commodity, reflecting an artificial shortage created by a partnership between Congress and organizations representing physicians&amp;mdash;with medical school seats and residency positions effectively allotted by the government, much like radio frequencies. Physicians benefit from this arrangement in that a smaller number of physicians inevitably leads to increased rates of reimbursement. There's nothing inherently wrong with this arrangement. However, it belies any claim that doctors should have the same right to choose their customers as barbers or babysitters. Much as the government has been willing to impose duties on radio stations (e.g., indecency codes, equal time rules) that would be impermissible if applied to newspapers, Montana might reasonably consider requiring physicians, in return for the privilege of a medical license, to prescribe medication to the dying without regard to the patient's intent.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;}}

Smith replies that this is "taking the duty to die and transforming it into a duty to kill", which he argues "reflects a profound misunderstanding of the government’s role".&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Aid Pakistan Truck.jpeg|thumb|right|180px|A right to adequate nutrition requires duties to avoid stealing, but also duties to act in ways that protect or repair the delivery of the supplies. The right cannot be fully guaranteed by only positive, or else only negative duties; it needs both.]]
Presumably, if a person has positive rights it implies that other people have positive duties (to take certain actions); whereas negative rights imply that others have negative duties (to avoid certain other actions). Philosopher [[Henry Shue]] is skeptical; he believes that all rights (regardless of whether they seem more "negative" or "positive") requires both kinds of duties at once. In other words, Shue says that honouring a right will require avoidance (a "negative" duty) but also protective or reparative actions ("positive" duties). The negative positive distinction may be a matter of emphasis; it is therefore unhelpful to describe ''any right'' as though it requires only one of the two types of duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights/&gt;

To Shue, rights can always be understood as confronting "standard threats" against humanity. Dealing with standard threats requires all kinds of duties, which may be divided across time (e.g. "if avoiding the harmful behaviour fails, begin to repair the damages"), but also divided across people. The point is that every right provokes all 3 types of behaviour (avoidance, protection, repair) to some degree. Dealing with a threat like murder, for instance, will require one individual to practice avoidance (e.g. the potential murderer must stay calm), others to protect (e.g. the police officer, who must stop the attack, or the bystander, who may be obligated to call the police), and others to repair (e.g. the doctor who must resuscitate a person who has been attacked). Thus, even the negative right not to be killed can only be guaranteed with the help of some positive duties. Shue goes further, and maintains that the negative and positive rights distinction can be harmful, because it may result in the neglect of necessary duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights&gt;Shue, Henry (1980). Chapters 1-2 of ''[[Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U.S. Foreign Policy]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

James P. Sterba makes similar criticisms. He holds that any right can be made to appear either positive or negative depending on the language used to define it. He writes:
{{quote|What is at stake is the liberty of the poor not to be interfered with in ''taking from the surplus possessions of the rich'' what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs. Needless to say, libertarians would want to deny that the poor have this liberty. But how could they justify such a denial? As this liberty of the poor has been specified, it is not a positive right to receive something, but a negative right of non-interference.(emphasis added){{ref|sterba}}}}
Sterba has rephrased the traditional "positive right" to provisions, and put it in the form of a sort of "negative right" ''not to be prevented'' from taking the resources on their own.. Thus, all rights may not only require both "positive" and "negative" duties, but it seems that rights that do not involve forced labor can be phrased positively or negatively at will.{{ref|sterba}} The distinction between positive and negative may not be very useful, or justified, as rights requiring the provision of labor can be rephrased from "[[right to education]]" or "[[right to health|right to health care]]" to "right to take surplus money to pay teachers" or "right to take surplus money to pay doctors".

'''Negative equity''' occurs when the value of an asset used to secure a loan is less than the outstanding balance on the loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13145239 America's foreclosure plan: Can’t pay or won’t pay?], Paragraph 5, ''[[The Economist]]'' (February 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, assets (particularly [[real estate]], whose loans are [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]]) with negative equity are often referred to as being "'''underwater'''", and loans and borrowers with negative equity are said to be "'''upside down'''". 

People and companies alike may have negative equity, as reflected on their [[balance sheet]]s.

== In an asset ==

In the owner-occupied [[real estate economics|housing market]], a fall in the [[market value]] of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] house or apartment/flat is the usual cause of negative equity. It may occur when the property owner obtains second-mortgage home-equity loans, causing the combined loans to exceed the home value, or simply because the original mortgage was too generous. If the borrower defaults, [[repossession]] and sale of the property by the lender will not raise enough cash to repay the amount outstanding, and the borrower will still be in [[debt]] as well as having lost the property. Some US states like [[California]] require lenders to choose between going after the borrower or taking repossession, but not both.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The term negative equity was widely used in the [[United Kingdom]] during the economic recession between 1991 and 1996, and in [[Hong Kong]] between 1998 and 2003. These recessions led to increased unemployment and a decline in property prices, which in turn led to an increase in [[repossession]]s by banks and [[Building society|building societies]] of properties worth less than the outstanding debt.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

It is also common for negative equity to occur when the value of a property drops shortly after its purchase. This occurs frequently in automobile loans, where the market value of a car might drop by 20-30% as soon as the car is driven off the lot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

While typically a result of fluctuating asset prices, negative equity can occur when the value of the asset stays fixed and the loan balance increases because loan payments are less than the interest, a situation known as [[negative amortization]]. The typical assets securing such loans are [[real property]] – commercial, office or residential. When the loan is [[Nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse]], the lender can only look to the security, that is, the value of the property, when the borrower fails to repay the loan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Since 2007, those most exposed to negative equity are borrowers who obtained loans of a high percentage of the property value (such as 90% or even 100%). These were commonly available before the [[credit crunch]]. Such cases are of course the most at risk from falls in property value.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Negative net worth ==
A person who has negative equity can be said to have "negative net worth", where the person's liabilities exceed their assets. One might come to have negative equity as a result of taking out a substantial, unsecured loan. For example, one might use a [[student loan]] to pursue higher education. Although education increases the likelihood of higher future earnings, potential alone is not a financial asset. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the United States, [[student loans]] are rarely dischargeable in [[bankruptcy]], and typically lenders provide student loans without requiring security. This stands in contrast to lenders requiring borrowers to have an equity stake in a comparably-sized real estate loan, as described above, secured by both a down payment and a mortgage. An explanation for the willingness of creditors to provide unsecured student loans is that, in a practical sense, American student loans are secured by the borrower's future earnings. This is so since creditors may legally garnish wages when a borrower defaults.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Effects ==

A home owner who is under water might be financially incapable of selling their current house and buying another one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zillow's Humphries on U.S. Housing Market Outlook|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/zillow-s-humphries-on-u-s-housing-market-outlook-4Pd_Q7stQ7WpSRarylLKdQ.html|work=bloomberg.com|publisher=BLOOMBERG L.P.|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">The concept of '''negative and positive [[frequency]]''' can be as simple as a wheel rotating one way or the other way: a ''signed value'' of frequency can indicate both the rate and direction of rotation. The rate is expressed in units such as revolutions (a.k.a. ''cycles'') per second ([[hertz]]) or [[radians per second|radian/second]] (where 1&amp;nbsp;cycle corresponds to 2''π''&amp;nbsp;[[radian]]s).

==Sinusoids==
Let ''ω'' be a nonnegative parameter with units of radians/sec.  Then the angular function (angle vs. time) {{nowrap|−''ωt'' + ''θ''}}, has slope −''ω'', which is called a '''negative frequency'''.  But when the function is used as the argument of a cosine operator, the result is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' − ''θ'')}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, {{nowrap|sin(−''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' − ''θ'' + ''π'')}}.  Thus any [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] can be represented in terms of positive frequencies.  The sign of the underlying phase slope is ambiguous.

[[File:Negative frequency.svg|thumb|right|300px|A negative frequency causes the sin function (violet) to lead the cos (red) by 1/4 cycle.]]
[[File:Unit_circle.svg|thumb|right|300px|The vector {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}} rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/second, and completes a circle every 2''π'' seconds.  The vector {{nowrap|(cos −''t'', sin −''t'')}} rotates in the other direction (not shown).]]
The ambiguity is resolved when the cosine and sine operators can be observed simultaneously, because {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} leads {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} by 1/4 cycle (= ''π''/2 radians) when {{nowrap|''ω'' &gt; 0}}, and lags by 1/4 cycle when {{nowrap|''ω'' &lt; 0}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, a vector, {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}}, rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/sec, and completes a circle every 2π seconds, and the vector {{nowrap|(cos −t, sin −t)}} rotates in the other direction.

The sign of ''ω'' is also preserved in the [[complex-valued function]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t} = \underbrace{\cos(\omega t)}_{R(t)} + i\cdot \underbrace{\sin(\omega t)}_{I(t)},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence is called [[Euler's formula]]&lt;/ref&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

since R(''t'') and I(''t'') can be separately extracted and compared.  Although &lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; clearly contains more information than either of its components, a common interpretation is that it is a simpler function, because:
* It simplifies many important [[Euler's formula#Relationship to trigonometry|trigonometric calculations]], which leads to its formal description as the [[analytic signal|analytic representation]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Euler's formula|Relationship to trigonometry}} and {{section link|Phasor|Addition}} for examples of calculations simplified by the complex representation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A corollary of {{EquationNote|Eq.1}} is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t) = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\left(e^{i \omega t} + e^{-i \omega t}\right),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}
which gives rise to the interpretation that cos(''ωt'') comprises ''both'' positive and negative frequencies.&amp;nbsp; But the sum is actually a cancellation that contains less, not more, information.  Any measure that indicates both frequencies includes a false positive, because ''ω'' can have only one sign.&lt;ref&gt;Conversely, any measure that indicates only one frequency has made an assumption, perhaps based on collateral information.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;  The [[Fourier transform]], for instance, merely tells us that cos(''ωt'') correlates equally well with both {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') + ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}} and with {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') − ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Applications==

Perhaps the most well-known application of negative frequency is the calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(\omega) = \int_{a}^{b} x(t)\cdot e^{-i\omega t} dt,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a measure of the amount of frequency ω in the function ''x''(''t'') over the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}.  When evaluated as a continuous function of ''ω'' for the theoretical interval {{nowrap|(−∞, ∞)}}, it is known as the [[Fourier transform]] of ''x''(''t'').  A brief explanation is that the product of two complex sinusoids is also a complex sinusoid whose frequency is the sum of the original frequencies.  So when ''ω'' is positive, &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; causes all the frequencies of ''x''(''t'') to be reduced by amount ''ω''.  Whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency ''ω'' is changed to frequency zero, which is just a constant whose amplitude level is a measure of the strength of the original ''ω'' content.  And whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency zero is changed to a sinusoid at frequency −''ω''.  Similarly, all other frequencies are changed to non-zero values.  As the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} increases, the contribution of the constant term grows in proportion.  But the contributions of the sinusoidal terms only oscillate around zero.  So ''X''(''ω'') improves as a relative measure of the amount of frequency ''ω'' in the function ''x''(''t'').

The [[Fourier transform]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; produces a non-zero response only at frequency ''ω''.  The transform of &lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; has responses at both ''ω'' and −''ω'', as anticipated by {{EquationNote|Eq.2}}.

==Sampling of positive and negative frequencies and aliasing==
{{Main article|Aliasing#Complex sinusoids}}
[[File:Aliasing between a positive and a negative frequency.png|frame|left|This figure depicts two complex sinusoids, colored gold and cyan, that fit the same sets of real and imaginary sample points.  They are thus aliases of each other when sampled at the rate (''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') indicated by the grid lines.  The gold-colored function depicts a positive frequency, because its real part (the cos function) leads its imaginary part by 1/4 of one cycle.  The cyan function depicts a negative frequency, because its real part lags the imaginary part.]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In operation, an increase in current through the fluorescent tube causes a drop in voltage across it. If the tube were connected directly to the power line, the falling tube voltage would cause more and more current to flow, causing it to [[arc flash]] and destroy itself.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt; To prevent this, fluorescent tubes are connected to the power line through a ''[[electrical ballast|ballast]]''.

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

}}, &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (flow of positive charge) is through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karady" /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a '''power source''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; so &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; This means current is forced to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; The charges gain potential energy, so power flows out of the device into the circuit:&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{diff} = \frac {dv}{di} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel diode ''TD'' has voltage controlled negative differential resistance.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt; The battery &lt;math&gt;V_b&lt;/math&gt; adds a constant voltage (bias) across the diode so it operates in its negative resistance range, and provides power to amplify the signal. Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDR acts as a dependent AC [[current source]] of value Δ''i'' = Δ''v''/''r''. Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

The device may also have [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and therefore the phase difference between current and voltage may differ from 180° and may vary with frequency.&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from [[transmission line]] theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the ''incident wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_I\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels toward the device, and the ''reflected wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_R\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels away from the device.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

The "reflected" (output) signal has larger amplitude than the incident; the device has "reflection gain".&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; The reflection coefficient is determined by the AC impedance of the negative resistance device, &lt;math&gt;Z_N(j\omega)\,=\,R_N\,+\,jX_N&lt;/math&gt;, and the impedance of the circuit attached to it, &lt;math&gt;Z_L(j\omega)\,=\,R_L\,+\,jX_L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; If &lt;math&gt;R_N\,&lt;\,0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma|\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; and the device will amplify.

===Operating regions and applications===
For simple nonreactive negative resistance devices with &lt;math&gt;R_N\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_N\;=\;0&lt;/math&gt; the different operating regions of the device can be illustrated by [[load line (electronics)|load line]]s on the ''I–V'' curve&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; ''(see graphs)''.

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515053022/https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC |date=2016-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
**CCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

===Q enhancement===
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;|R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite conference

===Negative impedance converter===

A common example of an "active resistance" circuit is the [[negative impedance converter]] (NIC)&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linvill"&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component. An NIC can cancel undesired positive resistance in another circuit,&lt;ref name="Maxim"&gt;{{cite web

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt; So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (''X'') as well as resistance (''R''). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a [[frequency domain]] technique due to K.

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

[[William Duddell]], a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and [[arc lamp|arc lights]] would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises.

O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field,&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Valdemar |last=Poulsen |title=System for producing continuous electric oscillations |booktitle=Transactions of the International Electrical Congress, St. Louis, 1904, Vol. 2 |pages=963–971 |publisher=J.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

In [[quantum thermodynamics]], certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve '''negative temperature'''; that is, their [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] can be expressed as a [[negative number|negative]] quantity on the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scales.

A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is ''hotter'' than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1956-07-01 |title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics at Negative Absolute Temperatures |journal=Physical Review |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v103/p20 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.103.20|bibcode = 1956PhRv..103...20R |authorlink1=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|last1=Ramsey|first1=Norman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1975-11-18 |title=Comment on: Negative Kelvin temperatures: some anomalies and a speculation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=44 |pages=994–995 |url=http://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/~tremblay/articles/Comment%20on%20%27Negative%20Kelvin%20temperatures,%20Some%20anomalies%20and%20a%20speculation%27.%20Tremblay.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.10248|issue=10|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44..994T|last1=Tremblay|first1=André-Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard example of such a system is [[population inversion]] in [[laser physics]].

[[Temperature]] is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation.  
The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] as the tradeoff between [[internal energy]] and [[entropy]]
contained in the system, with "[[thermodynamic beta|coldness]]", the ''reciprocal'' of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity.  
Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while  
systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages= 10–14|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamic systems cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding [[heat]] always increases their [[entropy]].  
The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. In classical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle speeds can in principle be increased indefinitely).
Systems bounded by a maximum amount of energy are generally forbidden in classical mechanics, and the phenomenon of negative temperature is strictly a 
[[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.  Some systems, however (see the [[#Examples|examples]] below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages=  89–95|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of temperature ==
The definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] {{mvar|T}} as a function of the change in the system's [[entropy]]  {{mvar|S}}  under reversible [[heat transfer]] 
&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{rev}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{dQ_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}.&lt;/math&gt;
Entropy being a [[state function]], the integral of {{mvar|dS}} over any cyclical process is zero.
For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system's energy {{mvar|E}}, the temperature can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; T  = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, [[thermodynamic beta]], or "coldness", is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{kT} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{dS}{dE},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Note that in classical thermodynamics, {{mvar|S}} is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, {{mvar|S}} is the [[statistical entropy]], a function of the possibly microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates.
For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other. 
However, for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, the definitions of statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not necessarily consistent, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. 

Some theorists have proposed using an alternate definition of entropy originally proposed by Gibbs as a way to resolve these inconsistencies,&lt;ref name="DunkelHilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Dunkel|first1 = Jorn|last2 = Hilbert|first2 = Stefan|title = Consistent thermostatistics forbids negative absolute temperatures|journal = Nature Physics|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 67|doi = 10.1038/nphys2815|arxiv = 1304.2066|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10...67D|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this new definition would create other inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gibbs, Boltzmann, and negative temperatures|journal = American Journal of Physics|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 0002-9505|pages = 163–170|volume = 83|issue = 2|doi = 10.1119/1.4895828|first = Daan|last = Frenkel|first2 = Patrick B.|last2 = Warren|arxiv = 1403.4299 |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..163F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality.  (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in [[statistical mechanics]] for systems with limited states.)  By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than [[absolute zero]], but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p.&amp;nbsp;462) put it, "The temperature scale from cold to hot runs:

: +0 K, … , +300 K, … , +∞ K, −∞ K, … , −300 K, … , −0 K."

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''kT'' (where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, … , 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, β is considered more natural than ''T''.   Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have -∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==
The distribution of energy among the various [[translation (physics)|translational]], [[oscillation|vibrational]], [[rotation]]al, [[Electron configuration|electronic]], and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a "normal" system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the [[Speed|time scale]] of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] [[spin (physics)|spins]] in a strong external [[magnetic field]]. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of [[Temperature#Second law of thermodynamics|temperature]] can be based on the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship suggests that a ''positive temperature'' corresponds to the condition where [[entropy]], ''S'', increases as thermal energy, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;, is added to the system. This is the "normal" condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===
{{multiple image

   | direction = vertical
   | footer    =

Entropy, thermodynamic beta, and temperature as a function of the energy for a system of ''N'' noninteracting two-level particles.

   | image2    = Negative temperature beta of E.png
   | width3    = 235
   | image3    = Negative temperature T of E.png
  }}
The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of ''N'' particles, each of which can take an energy of either ''+ε'' or ''-ε'' but are otherwise noninteracting.  This can be understood as a limit of the [[Ising model]] in which the interaction term becomes negligible.  The total energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E=\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i = \epsilon \cdot j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sign of the ''i''th particle and ''j'' is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with [[negative energy]].  From elementary [[combinatorics]], the total number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with this amount of energy is a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_E=\binom{N}{(N+j)/2} = \frac{N!}{\left(\frac{N+j}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N - j}{2}\right)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics]], the entropy of this [[microcanonical ensemble]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S=k_B \ln \Omega_E &lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for thermodynamic beta (β = 1/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T) by considering it as a [[central difference]] without taking the continuum limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_B} \frac{\delta_{2\epsilon}[S]}{2\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} ( \ln \Omega_{E+\epsilon} - \ln \Omega_{E-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{\left(\frac{N+j-1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j+1}{2}\right)!}{\left(\frac{N+j+1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j-1}{2}\right)!} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{N-j+1}{N+j+1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
hence the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T(E)=\frac{2\epsilon}{k_B}\left[\ln \left( \frac{(N+1)\epsilon - E}{(N+1)\epsilon + E} \right)\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property.  In the [[canonical ensemble]], the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property.  This leads to (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; refers to microstates):
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(Z) + \frac{E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles.  This leads to microstates &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_4  = 2&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \exp(-0 \beta) + 2\exp(-1 \beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = 1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{0\exp(-0 \beta) + 2*1\exp(-1 \beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)) + \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta))T}&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting values for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are all increasing with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1951-01-15 |title=A Nuclear Spin System at Negative Temperature |journal=Physical Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=279–280 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v81/p279 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.279|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..279P |authorlink1=Edward Mills Purcell |authorlink2=Robert Pound |last1=Purcell |first1=E.

In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to [[spin (physics)#Properties of spin|spin up and spin down]]. In the absence of a [[magnetic field]], these spin states are ''degenerate'', meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half  are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state).  It is possible to add energy to the spin system using [[radio frequency]] (RF) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Norman F.|authorlink=Norman Ramsey|title=Spectroscopy with coherent radiation: selected papers of Norman F. Ramsey with commentary|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore; River Edge, N.J.|isbn= 9789810232504 |pages=417|oclc=38753008|series=World Scientific series in 20th century physics, v. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes atoms to ''flip'' from spin-down to spin-up.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Malcolm H.|title=Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex, England|isbn= 978-0-470-51117-6|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature.&lt;ref name="kylma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/triennial/positive.html |title=Positive and negative picokelvin temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures.&lt;ref name="kylma" /&gt; It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many [[laser|lasing]] systems, wherein a large fraction of the system's [[atom]]s (for chemical and gas lasers) or [[electron]]s (in [[semiconductor]] lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a [[population inversion]].

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency ''ν'' is
:&lt;math&gt;H=(h\nu - \mu)a^\dagger a. \, &lt;/math&gt;
The density operator in the [[grand canonical ensemble]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\exp(-\beta H)}{\mathbf{Tr}( \exp(-\beta H))}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, ''βH'' must be positive semidefinite. So if ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and ''H'' is negative semidefinite, then ''β'' must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Motional degrees of freedom ===
Negative temperatures have also been achieved in motional [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. Using an [[optical lattice]], upper bounds were placed on the kinetic energy, interaction energy and potential energy of cold {{SimpleNuclide|Potassium|39}} atoms. This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a [[Feshbach resonance]] and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the [[Bose-Hubbard model|Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian]] from &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} \rightarrow -\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the [[Mott insulator]] regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = S. | last2 = Ronzheimer | first2 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12822">'''Negative thermal expansion''' (NTE) is an unusual [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] process in which some materials contract upon heating, rather than expand as most other materials do. Materials which undergo NTE have a range of potential [[engineering]], [[photonics|photonic]], [[Electronics|electronic]], and [[structural]] applications. For example, if one were to mix a '''negative thermal expansion''' material with a "normal" material which expands on heating, it could be possible to make a zero expansion [[composite material]].

== Origin of negative thermal expansion ==

There are a number of physical processes which may cause contraction with increasing temperature, including transverse vibrational modes, [[Rigid Unit Modes]] and [[phase transitions]].

Recently, Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2011.07.001|title=Origin of negative thermal expansion phenomenon in solids|year=2011|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shun-Li|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=65|issue=8|pages=664–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the NTE phenomenon originates from the existence of high pressure, small volume configurations with higher entropy, with their configurations present in the stable phase matrix through thermal fluctuations. They were able to predict both the colossal positive thermal expansion (In cerium) and zero and infinite negative thermal expansion (in {{chem|Fe|3|Pt}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep07043|pmid=25391631|pmc=4229665|title=Thermal Expansion Anomaly Regulated by Entropy|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=4|pages=7043|year=2014|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shunli|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E7043L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems ==

Negative thermal expansion is usually observed in non-close-packed systems with directional interactions (e.g. [[ice]], [[graphene]], etc.) and complex compounds (e.g. {{Chem|Cu|2|O}}, {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}, beta-quartz, some zeolites, etc.). However, in a paper,&lt;ref name=Rechtsman&gt;{{Citation

 | last3 = Torquato | first3 = S. | bibcode = 2007JPCA..11112816R| arxiv = 0807.3559}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was shown that negative thermal expansion (NTE) is also realized in single-component close-packed lattices with pair central force interactions. The following sufficient condition for potential giving rise to NTE behavior is proposed:

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a) &gt;  0,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Pi &lt;/math&gt; is pair [[interatomic potential]], &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium distance. This condition is (i) necessary and sufficient in 1D and (ii) sufficient, but not necessary in 2D and 3D. ''An approximate'' necessary and sufficient condition is derived in a paper&lt;ref name=Kuzkin&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Comment on 'Negative Thermal Expansion in Single-Component Systems with Isotropic Interactions'
 | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A
 | volume = 118

 |bibcode = 2014JPCA..118.9793K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a)a &gt; -(d-1)\Pi''(a),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the space dimensionality. Thus in 2D and 3D negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems with pair interactions is realized even when the third derivative of the potential is zero or even negative. Note that one-dimensional and multidimensional cases are qualitatively different. In 1D thermal expansion is cased by anharmonicity of [[interatomic potential]] only. Therefore, the sign of thermal expansion coefficient is determined by the sign of the third derivative of the potential. In multidimensional case the geometrical nonlinearity is also present, i.e. lattice vibrations are nonlinear even in the case of harmonic interatomic potential. This nonlinearity contributes to thermal expansion. Therefore, in multidimensional case both &lt;math&gt;\Pi''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi'''&lt;/math&gt; are present in the condition for negative thermal expansion.

== Applications ==

There are many potential applications for materials with controlled thermal expansion properties, as thermal expansion causes many problems in engineering, and indeed in everyday life. One simple example of a thermal expansion problem is the tendency of [[dental fillings]] to expand by an amount different from the [[teeth]], for example when drinking a hot drink, causing [[toothache]]. If dental fillings were made of a [[composite material]] containing a mixture of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion then the overall expansion could be precisely tailored to that of [[tooth enamel]].

== Materials ==

Perhaps one of the most studied materials to exhibit ''negative thermal expansion'' is '''[[zirconium tungstate]]''' ({{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}). This compound contracts continuously over a temperature range of 0.3 to 1050 K (at higher temperatures the material decomposes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Negative Thermal Expansion from 0.3 to 1050 Kelvin in {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=272|issue=5258|pages=90–92|doi= 10.1126/science.272.5258.90|bibcode = 1996Sci...272...90M|last1=Mary|first1=T. A.|last2=Evans|first2=J. S. O.|last3=Vogt|first3=T.|last4=Sleight|first4=A. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials that exhibit this behaviour include: other members of the {{chem|A|M|2|O|8}} family of materials (where A = {{chem|Zr}} or {{chem|Hf}}, M = {{chem|Mo}} or {{chem|W}}) and {{chem|Zr|V|2|O|7}}. {{chem|A|2|({{Chem|M|O|4}})|3}} also is an example of controllable ''negative thermal expansion''.

Ordinary ice shows NTE in its hexagonal and cubic phases at very low temperatures (below –200&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=ice_NTE&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108768194004933|title=Lattice constants and thermal expansion of {{Chem|H|2|O}} and {{Chem|D|2|O}} ice Ih between 10 and 265 K|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B|year=1994|volume= 50|pages=644–648|issue=6|last1=Röttger|first1=K.|last2=Endriss|first2=A.|last3=Ihringer|first3=J.|last4=Doyle|first4=S.|last5=Kuhs|first5=W. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its liquid form, pure [[water]] also displays negative thermal expansivity below 3.984&amp;nbsp;°C.

[[Rubber elasticity]] shows NTE at normal temperatures, but the reason for the effect is rather different from that in most other materials. Put simply, as the long polymer chains absorb energy, they adopt a more contorted configuration, reducing the volume of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeleyphysicsdemos.net/node/344 |title=Heating a rubber band: negative coefficient of thermal expansion &amp;#124; Lecture Demonstrations |publisher=Berkeleyphysicsdemos.net |date= |accessdate=2015-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartz ({{chem|Si|O|2}}) and a number of zeolites also show NTE over certain temperature ranges.&lt;ref name=zeolite1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/b002950p|title=The widespread occurrence of negative thermal expansion in zeolites|journal= Journal of Materials Chemistry|year= 2001|volume= 11|pages=212–216|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Philip|last2=Woodcock|first2=David A.|last3=Maple|first3=Martin J.|last4=Villaescusa|first4=Luis A.|last5=Wright|first5=Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zeolite2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attfield|first1=Martin P.|title=Strong negative thermal expansion in siliceous faujasite|journal= Chemical Communications|year=1998|pages=601–602|doi=10.1039/A707141H|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly pure silicon (Si) has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion for temperatures between about 18 K and 120 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = William C. |editor1-last= O'Mara |editor2-first = Robert B. |editor2-last=Herring | editor3-first = Lee P. |editor3-last=Hunt

Cubic [[Scandium trifluoride]] has this property which is explained by the quartic oscillation of the fluoride ions. The energy stored in the bending strain of the fluoride ion is proportional to the fourth power of the displacement angle, unlike most other materials where it is proportional to the square of the displacement. A fluorine atom is bound to two scandium atoms, and as temperature increases the fluorine oscillates more perpendicularly to its bonds. This draws the scandium atoms together throughout the material and it contracts.&lt;ref name="woo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-incredible-material-reveal-scandium-trifluoride.html|title=An incredible shrinking material: Engineers reveal how scandium trifluoride contracts with heat|last=Woo|first=Marcus|date=7 November 2011|publisher=Physorg|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|Sc|F|3}} exhibits this property from 10 to 1100 K above which it shows the normal positive thermal expansion.&lt;ref name="greve"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greve|first=Benjamin K.|author2=Kenneth L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">A '''notion''' in [[philosophy]] is a reflection in the [[mind]] of [[reality|real]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[phenomena]] in their [[essence|essential]] features and relations.  Notions are usually described in terms of scope and content. This is because notions are often created in response to [[empirical]] [[observations]] (or [[experiment]]s) of covarying trends among variables.

''Notion'' is the common translation for ''Begriff'' as used by [[Hegel]] in his [[Science of Logic#Introduction|Science of Logic]] (1816).

== Primitive notion ==
A [[primitive notion]] is used in [[logic]] or [[mathematics]] as an undefined term or concept at the foundation of an axiomatic system to be constructed. 

However, in philosophy the term "primitive notion" has historical content. For example, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] wrote ''De Alphabeto Cogitationum Humanarum'' ([[English language|English]]: ''An Alphabet for Human Thought''). Jaap Maat (2004) reviewed Leibniz for ''Philosophical Languages of the 17th Century''. According to Leibniz, "The alphabet of human thought is a catalogue of primitive notions, or those we cannot render clearer by any definitions." Maat explains, "a thing which is known without other intermediate notions can be considered to be primitive," and further, "a primitive notion is said to be conceived through itself".

Another example is in the ''Meditations'' of [[René Descartes]]:
:I think that there are certain primitive notions in us which are like originals. There are very few such notions. For apart from the most general notions of being, number, duration, etc which apply to everything that we can conceive, we have only the notion of extension that is specifically for the body, and from that flow the notions of shape and movement; and for the soul on its own we have only the concept of thought, which includes perceptions of the understanding and inclinations of the will. Finally, for the body and soul together, we have only the concept of their union, on which depends the notion of the soul's power to move the body and the body's power to act on the soul by causing its sensations and passions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond M. Clarke]] (2003) ''Descartes's Theory of Mind'', page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

:"[Descartes'] claim that mind-body unity is a primitive notion on a par with the primitive notions of thinking and extended substance..."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber (1992) ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'', page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paired opposites''' are an ancient, pre-Socratic method of establishing [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis and synthesis]] in terms of a standard for what is right and proper in [[natural philosophy]].

== Paired opposites in the proportions of units ==

[[Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar]] ranges and [[coordinate system]]s are paired opposites within [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Incorporating [[dimensions]] of positive and negative numbers and [[exponent]]s, or expanding x, y and z coordinates, by adding a fourth dimension of time allows a resolution of position relative to the standard of the [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] which is often taken as 0,0,0,0 with additional dimensions added as referential scales are expanded from space and time to mass and energy.

Ancient systems frequently scaled their degree of opposition by rate of increase or rate of decrease. [[Linear]] increase was enhanced by doubling systems. An [[acceleration]] in the rate of increase or decrease could be analyzed arithmetrically, geometrically, or through a wide range of other numerical and physical analysis. [[Arithmetic series|Arithmetic]] and [[geometric series]], and other methods of rating proportionate expansion or contraction could be thought of as [[wikt:convergent|convergent]] or [[divergence (statistics)|divergent]] toward a position.

Though unit quantities were first defined by [[spatial dimensions]], and then expanded by adding coordinates of time, the weight or mass a given spatial dimension could contain was also considered and even in antiquity, conditions under which the standard would be established such as at a given temperature, distance from sea level, or density were added.

Rates of change over time were then considered as either indexes of production or depletion

== Paired opposites as rhetorical device==

Paired opposites are used as poetic diction meaning "everything".  Common phrases incorporated paired opposites in English include "all creatures great and small," "working for the man every night and day," "more things in heaven and Earth" "searching high and low" "in sickness and in health".   In Greek literature, [[Homer]] uses the device when he lets [[Telemachus]] say, "I know all things, the good and the evil" (Od.20:309-10).&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Cyrus H.|last2=Rendsburg |first2=Gary A. |title=The Bible and the ancient Near East |year=1997 |publisher=W.W.

The same phrase is used in Hebrew in text of Genesis, referring to the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Orlinsky]]'s notes to the NJPS Torah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space and Time in the Religious Life of the Near East |last=Wyatt |first=Nicolas |page=244 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-567-04942-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjugate Variables==

In [[quantum mechanics]], as well as some fields of mathematics, [[conjugate variables]] are a form of paired opposites, in which knowledge of one precludes knowledge of the other.  A standard example is the relation between position (x) and momentum (p), which can be expressed in terms of the [[uncertainty principle]] as &lt;math&gt; \Delta p \Delta x \geq \hbar&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Philosophy of mind''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the [[mind]].

Monism is the position that mind and body are not [[ontology|ontologically]] distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in [[Western philosophy]] by [[Parmenides]] in the 5th century BCE and was later espoused by the 17th century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;Spinoza, Baruch (1670) ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'' (A Theologico-Political Treatise).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physicalism|Physicalists]] argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.

 }} &lt;!--Kim, J., "Problems in the Philosophy of Mind". ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.

Our perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] that arrive at our various [[Sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world, and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt;

A related problem is how someone's [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and muscles to contract. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[Epistemology|epistemologists]] and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

==Dualist solutions to the mind–body problem==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] is a set of views about the relationship between [[mind]] and [[matter]] (or [[Human body|body]]). It begins with the claim that mental [[phenomenon|phenomena]] are, in some respects, non-[[nature|physical]].&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern [[Sankhya]] and [[Yoga]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into [[purusha]] (mind/spirit) and [[prakriti]] (material substance).&lt;ref name="Sa" /&gt; Specifically, the [[Yoga Sutra]] of [[Patanjali]] presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind.

In [[Western Philosophy]], the earliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of [[Plato]] who maintained that humans' "intelligence" (a faculty of the mind or soul) could not be identified with, or explained in terms of, their physical body.&lt;ref name="Plato" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;Robinson, H. (1983): "Aristotelian dualism", Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 1, 123–44.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the best-known version of dualism is due to [[René Descartes]] (1641), and holds that the mind is a non-extended, non-physical substance, a "[[mental substance|res cogitans]]".&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with [[consciousness]] and [[self-awareness]], and to distinguish this from the brain, which was the seat of intelligence. He was therefore the first to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it still exists today.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

===Arguments for dualism===
The most frequently used argument in favor of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their [[self (psychology)|self]], their personality, their [[soul]], or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one [[ontology|ontological]] entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with [[empirical evidence]] from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt;

Another important argument in favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties.&lt;ref name="Ja"&gt;Jackson, F. (1982) "Epiphenomenal Qualia." Reprinted in Chalmers, David ed. :2002. ''Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of [[glutamate]] in the dorsolateral portion of the [[prefrontal cortex]] feels like.

Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events "[[qualia]]" or "raw feels".&lt;ref name="Ja" /&gt; There is something that it is like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – what it is like to see the color red.&lt;ref name="Nagel"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nagel, T. | title=What is it like to be a bat? | journal=Philosophical Review | issue=83 | pages=435–456 |year=1974|url=http://www.esalq.usp.br/lepse/imgs/conteudo_thumb/What-Is-It-Like-to-Be-a-Bat-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One possible explanation is that of a miracle, proposed by [[Arnold Geulincx]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche]], where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.

Another possible argument that has been proposed by [[C. S. Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.S | title=Miracles | year=1947 | isbn=978-0-688-17369-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Argument from Reason]]: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the [[consequent]] of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.

The [[p-zombie|zombie argument]] is based on a [[thought experiment]] proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by [[David Chalmers]] in his book ''[[The Conscious Mind]]''. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' argument is that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via [[physics]], the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chalmers, David | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-19-511789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Dennett have [[Philosophical zombie#Criticism|argued]] that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent,&lt;ref name="Dennett, Daniel 1995 322–6"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=The unimagined preposterousness of zombies |year=1995 |journal=J Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |pages=322–6 |url=http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/unzombie.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515115656/http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/unzombie.htm |archivedate=2017-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, Daniel | title=Consciousness Explained | publisher=Little, Brown and Co. | year=1991 | page=95 | isbn=978-0-316-18065-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!"&lt;ref name="Dennett, Daniel 1995 322–6"/&gt;

===Interactionist dualism===
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[René Descartes]] by [[Frans Hals]] (1648)]]
Interactionist dualism, or simply interactionism, is the particular form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the ''Meditations''.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; In the 20th century, its major defenders have been [[Karl Popper]] and [[John Carew Eccles]].&lt;ref name="PopE"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Popper, Karl  |author2=Eccles, John  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Self and Its Brain | publisher=Springer Verlag | year=2002 | isbn=978-3-492-21096-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt;

Descartes' famous argument for this position can be summarized as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be measured in terms of length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

At the same time, however, it is clear that Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have [[causality|causal]] effects on his body and vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the caregiver (mental event), and so on.

Descartes' argument crucially depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be "clear and distinct" ideas in his mind are [[logical truth|necessarily true]]. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;Dennett D., (1991), ''Consciousness Explained'', Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;Stich, S., (1983), ''From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]] (Bradford)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, G., 1949, The Concept of Mind, New York: Barnes and Noble&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Joseph Agassi]] suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. [[Pierre Duhem|Duhem]] has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=Privileged Access; ''Science in Flux, Boston Stidues in the Philosophy of Science'', 80| publisher=Reidel| location=Dordrecht| year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=La Scienza in Divenire | publisher=Armando | location=Rome | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forms of dualism===
[[File:DualismCausationViews3.svg|400px|thumb|Four varieties of dualism. The arrows indicate the direction of the causal interactions. Occasionalism is not shown.]]

====Psychophysical parallelism====
[[Psychophysical parallelism]], or simply '''parallelism''', is the view that mind and body, while having distinct ontological statuses, do not causally influence one another. Instead, they run along parallel paths (mind events causally interact with mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events) and only seem to influence each other.&lt;ref name="DuSEP"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was most prominently defended by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Although Leibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of substance, the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monad]], exists in the universe, and that everything is reducible to it, he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between "the mental" and "the physical" in terms of causation. He held that God had arranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with each other. This is known as the doctrine of [[pre-established harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Leibniz | first=Gottfried Wilhelm | title=Monadology | year=1714 | isbn=978-0-87548-030-5| title-link=Monadology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occasionalism====
[[Occasionalism]] is the view espoused by [[Nicholas Malebranche]] as well as Islamic philosophers  such as [[Al-Ghazali|Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali]] that asserts that all supposedly causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects by an act of God's intervention on each specific occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Property dualism====
[[Property dualism]] is the view that the world is constituted of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]] – the physical kind – and there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical bodies (at least, brains). How mental and physical properties relate causally depends on the variety of property dualism in question, and is not always a clear issue. Sub-varieties of property dualism include:

#[[Emergent materialism]] asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge  in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to, or explained in terms of, the physical substrate from which they emerge. They are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge, but opinions vary as to the coherence of [[top–down causation]], i.e. the causal effectiveness of such properties. A form of emergent materialism has been espoused by [[David Chalmers]] and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years,&lt;ref name="Chalmers"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chalmers |first=David | authorlink=David Chalmers | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 | isbn = 978-0-19-511789-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was already suggested in the 19th century by [[William James]].
#[[Epiphenomenalism]] is a doctrine first formulated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. [1874] "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555–580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world.&lt;ref name="DuSEP" /&gt; This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jackson, Frank | title=What Mary didn't know | journal=Journal of Philosophy | year=1986 |pages=291–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Property dualism#Non-reductive Physicalism|Non-reductive physicalism]] is the view that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia in the case of non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.
#[[Panpsychism]] is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [[complexity|complex]] structure in a compound object. So long as the ''reduction'' of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.

====Dual aspect theory====
[[Dual aspect theory]] or dual-aspect monism is the view that the [[mind|mental]] and the [[nature|physical]] are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance.  (Thus it is a mixed position, which is monistic in some respects). In modern philosophical writings, the theory's relationship to [[neutral monism]] has become somewhat ill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships into which they enter to determine whether the group can be thought of as mental, physical, both, or neither, dual-aspect theory suggests that the mental and the physical are manifestations (or aspects) of some underlying substance, entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as normally understood. Various formulations of dual-aspect monism also require the mental and the physical to be complementary, mutually irreducible and perhaps inseparable (though distinct).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atmanspacher | first1 = H | year = 2012 | title = Dual-aspect monism a la Pauli and Jung | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harald_Atmanspacher/publication/262956033_Dual-Aspect_Monism_a_la_Pauli_and_Jung/links/568a246308ae051f9af9ca21.pdf | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies: Special Issue on Monist Alternatives to Physicalism | volume = 19 | issue = 9–10| pages = 96–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Velmans | first1 = M | year = 2012 | title = Reflexive Monism: psychophysical relations among mind, matter and consciousness | url = https://www.academia.edu/2053423 | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies: Special Issue on Monist Alternatives to Physicalism | volume = 19 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 143–165 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171111113509/http://www.academia.edu/2053423/Reflexive_Monism_Psychophysical_relations_among_mind_matter_and_consciousness | archivedate = 2017-11-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Stubenberg.

==== Experiential dualism ====
This is a philosophy of mind that regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical well-being as not necessarily synonymous thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind.  An example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by [[B. Alan Wallace|Allan Wallace]] who notes that it is "experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Consciousness At The Crossroads: Conversations With The Dalai Lama On Brain Science And Buddhism|last=Wallace|first=Allen|publisher=Snow Lion|year=1999|isbn=9780545227209|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical world seems qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one.  This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another.  Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa.

However, unlike cartesian dualism or some other systems, experiential dualism does not posit two fundamental substances in reality: mind and matter.  Rather, experiential dualism is to be understood as a conceptual framework that gives credence to the qualitative difference between the experience of mental and physical states.  Experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework of [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka Buddhism]].

Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding fault with the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind as well in that these generally posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality.  Nonetheless, this does not imply that the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.&lt;blockquote&gt;In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed, physicalism, or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality, is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one's childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, for the simple reason that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Hylomorphism====
{{Main|Hylomorphism}}
Hylomorphism is a theory that originates with [[Aristotle|Aristotelian philosophy]], which conceives [[ousia|being]] as a compound of [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. "Hylomorphism" is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη ''hyle'', "wood, matter", and μορφή, ''morphē'', "form".

==Monist solutions to the mind–body problem==
In contrast to [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], [[monism]] does not accept any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]], monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are [[physicalism|physicalist]].&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science.&lt;ref name="Stol"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, [[idealism]], states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, such as that of [[George Berkeley]], is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called [[panpsychism]], according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as [[Alfred North Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Anderson Weekes (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind (Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408022540/http://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind |date=2015-04-08 }}'', Albany, New York, State University of New York Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Ray Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers" /&gt;

[[Phenomenalism]] is the theory that representations (or [[sense data]]) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by [[Bertrand Russell]] and many of the [[logical positivists]] during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1918) ''Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays'', London: Longmans, Green.&lt;/ref&gt; A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza&lt;ref name="Spin" /&gt; and was popularized by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1886) ''Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen.'' Fifth edition translated as ''The Analysis of Sensations and the Relation of Physical to the Psychical'', New York: Dover. 1959&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century. This [[neutral monism]], as it is called, resembles property dualism.

===Physicalistic monisms===

====Behaviorism====
{{Main|Behaviorism}}
Behaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the 20th century, especially the first half.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of [[introspection]]ism.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Skinner, B.F. | title=Beyond Freedom &amp; Dignity | publisher=Bantam/Vintage Books |location=New York | year=1972 | isbn=978-0-553-14372-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to these developments in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; This is characterized by a strong [[verificationism]], which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or [[disposition]]s to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ryle, Gilbert | title=The Concept of Mind | publisher=Chicago University Press | location=Chicago | year=1949 |isbn=978-0-226-73295-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical behaviorism has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several perceived problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be [[counterintuitive]] when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.

====Identity theory====
{{Main|Type physicalism}}
Type physicalism (or type-identity theory) was developed by [[J. J. C. Smart|John Smart]]&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; and [[Ullin Place]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Place, Ullin | title=Is Consciousness a Brain Process? | journal=British Journal of Psychology | year=1956 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1956.tb00560.x | volume=47 | pages=44–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a direct reaction to the failure of behaviorism. These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states are something material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain. In very simplified terms: a mental state ''M'' is nothing other than brain state ''B''. The mental state "desire for a cup of coffee" would thus be nothing more than the "firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions".&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;
[[File:Anomalous Monism.png|thumb|right|250px|The classic Identity theory and Anomalous Monism in contrast. For the Identity theory, every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds (as indicated by the arrows) to a physical token of a single physical type. For anomalous monism, the token–token correspondences can fall outside of the type–type correspondences. The result is token identity.]]

Despite its initial plausibility, the identity theory faces a strong challenge in the form of the thesis of [[multiple realizability]], first formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]].&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt; For example, not only humans, but many different species of animals can experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt;

On the other hand, even granted the above, it does not follow that identity theories of all types must be abandoned. According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word "green" contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter ''e'' along with one each of the others.
The idea of token identity is that only particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/malebranche "Identity Theory"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2002 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Anomalous monism (see below) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Davidson, D.| title=Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2001 | isbn=978-88-7078-832-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these problems, there is a renewed interest in the type identity theory today, primarily due to the influence of [[Jaegwon Kim]].&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;

====Functionalism====
{{Main|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}
Functionalism was formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]] as a reaction to the inadequacies of the identity theory.&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt; Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical [[computational theory of mind|computational theory of the mind]].&lt;ref name="Block"&gt;Block, Ned. "What is functionalism" in ''Readings in Philosophy of Psychology'', 2 vols. Vol 1. (Cambridge: Harvard, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time or slightly after, [[D.M. Armstrong]] and [[David Kellogg Lewis]] formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, D., 1968, ''A Materialist Theory of the Mind'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by [[Wilfrid Sellars]] and [[Gilbert Harman]]. Another one, [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)#Psychofunctionalism|psychofunctionalism]], is an approach adopted by the [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Metaphysical naturalism|naturalistic philosophy of mind]] associated with Jerry Fodor and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]].

What all these different varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.&lt;ref name="Block" /&gt;

====Non-reductive physicalism====
{{Main|Physicalism}}

Non-reductionist philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with regard to mind–body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states, but 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory: mental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional states.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s [[anomalous monism]]&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism. He "thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason, such as akrasia or self-deception, the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one, but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Francesco M. &amp; Marraffa M.|title=The Unconscious, consciousness, and the Self illusion|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2013|volume=6|issue=1|pages=10–22|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A13-01.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303051022/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A13-01.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson uses the thesis of [[supervenience]]: mental states supervene on physical states, but are not reducible to them. "Supervenience" therefore describes a functional dependence: there can be no change in the mental without some change in the physical–causal reducibility between the mental and physical without ontological reducibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanton | first1 = W.L. | year = 1983 | title = Supervenience and Psychological Law in Anomalous Monism | url = | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 72–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because non-reductive physicalist theories attempt to both retain the ontological distinction between mind and body and try to solve the "surfeit of explanations puzzle" in some way; critics often see this as a paradox and point out the similarities to [[epiphenomenalism]], in that it is the brain that is seen as the root "cause" not the mind, and the mind seems to be rendered inert.

Epiphenomenalism regards one or more mental states as the byproduct of physical brain states, having no influence on physical states. The interaction is one-way (solving the "surfeit of explanations puzzle") but leaving us with non-reducible mental states (as a byproduct of brain states) – causally reducible, but ontologically irreducible to physical states. Pain would be seen by epiphenomenaliasts as being caused by the brain state but as not having effects on other brain states, though it might have effects on other mental states (i.e. cause distress).

====Weak emergentism====
{{Main|Emergentism}}
Weak emergentism is a form of "non-reductive physicalism" that involves a layered view of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science. Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, while others maintain that higher-order properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction. The latter group therefore holds a less strict, or "weaker", definition of emergentism, which can be rigorously stated as follows: a property P of composite object O is emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack property P if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties identical to those in O and has those parts in an identical configuration.

Sometimes emergentists use the example of water having a new property when Hydrogen H and Oxygen O combine to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water). In this example there "emerges" a new property of a transparent liquid that would not have been predicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases. This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state. Emergentists try to solve the notorious mind–body gap this way. One problem for emergentism is the idea of "causal closure" in the world that does not allow for a mind-to-body causation.&lt;ref&gt;Jaegwon Kim, Philosophy of Mind, Westview Press; 2 edition (July 8, 2005) {{ISBN|0-8133-4269-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eliminative materialism====
{{Main|Eliminative materialism}}
If one is a materialist and believes that all aspects of our common-sense psychology will find reduction to a mature [[cognitive neuroscience]], and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, more radical position: eliminative materialism.

There are several varieties of eliminative materialism, but all maintain that our common-sense "[[folk psychology]]" badly misrepresents the nature of some aspect of cognition. Eliminativists such as [[Patricia Churchland|Patricia]] and [[Paul Churchland]] argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence-like, the non-linguistic vector/matrix model of neural network theory or [[connectionism]] will prove to be a much more accurate account of how the brain works.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;

The Churchlands often invoke the fate of other, erroneous popular theories and [[ontology|ontologies]] that have arisen in the course of history.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt; For example, Ptolemaic astronomy served to explain and roughly predict the motions of the planets for centuries, but eventually this model of the solar system was eliminated in favor of the Copernican model. The Churchlands believe the same eliminative fate awaits the "sentence-cruncher" model of the mind in which thought and behavior are the result of manipulating sentence-like states called "[[propositional attitude]]s".

===Non-physicalist monisms===

====Idealism====
[[Idealism]] is the form of monism that sees the world as consisting  of minds, mental contents and or consciousness.
Idealists are not faced with explaining how  minds arise from bodies: rather, the world, bodies and objects are regarded as mere appearances held by minds. However, accounting for the mind–body problem is not usually the main motivation for idealism; rather, idealists tend to be motivated by [[skepticism]], intentionality, and the unique nature of ideas.
Idealism is prominent in Eastern religious and philosophical thought. It has gone through several cycles of popularity and neglect in the history of Western philosophy.

Different varieties of idealism may hold that there are
* multiple  minds ([[pluralistic idealism]])
* only one human mind ([[solipsism]])
* or a single [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], [[Anima Mundi]], [[Plotinus#One|One]] or [[Over-soul]].

====Neutral monism====
[[Neutral monism]], in [[philosophy]], is the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental.  This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical. These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape, just as we experience those properties. But these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether dualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.

==Mysterianism==
{{Main|New mysterianism}}
Some philosophers take an epistemic approach and argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed [[New mysterianism]]. [[Colin McGinn]] holds that human beings are [[Cognitive closure (philosophy)|cognitively closed]] in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as [[consciousness]] arise from their causal basis.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Colin. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 "Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226060901/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 |date=2016-12-26 }}, ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 98, No. 391, July 1989 (pp. 349–366), p. 350.
*Reprinted in O'Connor, Timothy and Robb, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BlSDUzfMxo0C&amp;pg=PA438 "Colin McGinn, Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?"], ''Philosophy of Mind: Contemporary Readings''. Routledge, 2003, p. 438ff.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.

A more moderate conception has been expounded by [[Thomas Nagel]], which holds that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that it might take a future scientific [[paradigm shift]] or revolution to bridge the [[explanatory gap]]. Nagel posits that in the future a sort of "objective [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]" might be able to bridge the gap between subjective conscious experience and its physical basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/#SH3b "Hard problem of Consciousness"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420211306/http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/ |date=2015-04-20 }}, ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Josh Weisberg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic criticism of the mind–body problem==
Each attempt to answer the mind–body problem encounters substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion.&lt;ref name="Hacker"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hacker, Peter | title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience | publisher=Blackwel Pub. | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory.&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wittgenstein, Ludwig | title=Philosophical Investigations | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1954 | isbn=978-0-631-14660-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt; This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a [[category error]] or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt;

Today, such a position is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as [[Peter Hacker]].&lt;ref name="Hacker" /&gt; However, [[Hilary Putnam]], the originator of functionalism, has also adopted the position that the mind–body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Putnam, Hilary | title=The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body, and World | publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York | year=2000 |isbn=978-0-231-10286-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Externalism and internalism==
Where is the mind located? If the mind is a physical phenomenon of some kind, it has to be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the mind is internal to the body ([[internalism]]) or the mind is external to it ([[externalism]]). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.

Proponents of internalism are committed to the view that neural activity is sufficient to produce the mind.
Proponents of externalism maintain that the surrounding world is in some sense constitutive of the mind.

Externalism differentiates into several versions. The main ones are [[semantic externalism]], [[cognitive externalism]] and [[phenomenal externalism]]. Each of these versions of externalism can further be divided into whether they refer only to the content or to the vehicles of the mind.

Semantic externalism holds that the semantic content of the mind is totally or partially defined by a state of affairs external to the body of the subject. [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[Twin Earth thought experiment]] is a good example.

Cognitive externalism is a very broad collection of views that suggests the role of the environment, of tools, of development, and of the body in fleshing out cognition. [[Embodied cognition]], the [[extended mind]], and [[enactivism]] are good examples.

Phenomenal externalism suggests that the phenomenal aspects of the mind are external to the body. Authors who addressed this possibility are Ted Honderich, Edwin Holt, Francois Tonneau, Kevin O'Regan, Riccardo Manzotti, Teed Rockwell and Max Velmans.

==Naturalism and its problems==
The thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material (or physical) world. Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other material thing seems to possess. Physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a material thing. The project of providing such an explanation is often referred to as the "[[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalization]] of the mental".&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt;

===Qualia===
{{Main|Qualia}}

Many mental states seem to be experienced subjectively in different ways by different individuals.&lt;ref name="Nagel" /&gt; And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential ''quality'', e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since no one has a perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.&lt;ref name="Ja" /&gt;

Yet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such experiences.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] an assumption about the possibility of [[reductionism|reductive explanations]]. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency).&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; In the case of mental states, this means that there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.

The 20th-century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] criticized the [[ontology|ontological]] assumptions underpinning such a reductive model, and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms. This is because, according to Heidegger, the nature of our subjective experience and its ''qualities'' is impossible to understand in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties". Another way to put this is that the very concept of qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of—or is semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of—substances that bear properties.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, Sept. 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem of explaining introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the [[explanatory gap]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]], ''Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap'', in: ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'', vol. 64, no. 4, October, 1983, 354–361&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different views of the nature of this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. [[David Chalmers]] and the early [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] interpret the gap as [[ontology|ontological]] in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because [[physicalism]] is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, F. (1986) "What Mary didn't Know", Journal of Philosophy, 83, 5, pp. 291–295.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as [[Thomas Nagel]] and [[Colin McGinn]]. According to them, the gap is [[epistemology|epistemological]] in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently.&lt;ref name="Nagel" /&gt; For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, C. "Can the Mind-Body Problem Be Solved", ''Mind'', New Series, Volume 98, Issue 391, pp. 349–366. a [http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf (online)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101441/http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to the famous "''Qualia Question''", which is: ''Does Red cause Redness''?

===Intentionality===
{{Main|Intentionality}}
[[File:John Searle 2002.jpg|thumb|[[John Searle]]—one of the most influential philosophers of mind, proponent of [[biological naturalism]] (Berkeley 2002)]]
[[Intentionality]] is the capacity of mental states to be directed towards (''about'') or be in relation with something in the external world.&lt;ref name="Searleint" /&gt; This property of mental states entails that they have [[mental content|contents]] and [[semantics|semantic referents]] and can therefore be assigned [[truth value]]s. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fodor, Jerry | title=Psychosemantics. The problem of meaning in the philosophy of mind | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-262-06106-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not make any sense to say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that [[Herodotus]] was a historian refers to Herodotus and to the fact that he was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.&lt;ref name="Int" /&gt;

==Philosophy of perception==
{{Main|Philosophy of perception}}
[[Philosophy of perception]] is concerned with the nature of [[Perception|perceptual experience]] and the status of perceptual objects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world. The main contemporary views within philosophy of perception include [[naive realism]], [[enactivism]] and [[Mental representation|representational]] views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macpherson, F. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, S. (2011)."The Contents of Perception", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/perception-contents/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of mind and science==
Humans are corporeal beings and, as such, they are subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind.&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[cognitive science]], [[cybernetics]], [[linguistics]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacology]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Pinker"&gt;Pinker, S. (1997) ''How the Mind Works''. tr. It: ''Come Funziona la Mente''. Milan:Mondadori, 2000. {{ISBN|88-04-49908-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiology===
{{Main|Neuroscience}}
The theoretical background of biology, as is the case with modern [[natural science]]s in general, is fundamentally materialistic. The objects of study are, in the first place, physical processes, which are considered to be the foundations of mental activity and behavior.&lt;ref name="Bear"&gt;Bear, M. F. et al. Eds. (1995). ''Neuroscience: Exploring The Brain''. Baltimore, Maryland, Williams and Wilkins. {{ISBN|0-7817-3944-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing success of biology in the explanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical refutation of its fundamental presupposition: "there can be no change in the mental states of a person without a change in brain states."&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt;

Within the field of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes:&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; [[Neurophysiology|Sensory neurophysiology]] investigates the relation between the processes of [[perception]] and [[stimulation]].&lt;ref name="Pinel"&gt;{{cite book | author=Pinel, J.P.J | title=Psychobiology | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=1997 | isbn=978-88-15-07174-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive neuroscience]] studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes.&lt;ref name="Pinel" /&gt; [[Neuropsychology]] describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain.&lt;ref name="Pinel" /&gt; Lastly, [[evolutionary biology]] studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenesis|phylogenetic]] development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages.&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt; Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the [[gene]]-based mechanism of [[natural selection]] does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Metzinger, Thomas | title=Being No One – The Self Model Theory of Subjectivity | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=2003 | pages=349–366 | isbn=978-0-262-13417-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Functional magnetic resonance imaging.jpg|thumb|Since the 1980s, sophisticated [[neuroimaging]] procedures, such as [[fMRI]] (above), have furnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain, shedding light on ancient philosophical problems.]]

The [[methodology|methodological]] breakthroughs of the neurosciences, in particular the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: one of the main goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: [[neural correlate]]).&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; Several groups are inspired by these advances.

===Computer science===
{{Main|Computer science}}
Computer science concerns itself with the automatic processing of [[information]] (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as [[computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sipser, M.| title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation | location=Boston, Mass. | publisher=PWS Publishing Co. | isbn=978-0-534-94728-6 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, [[computer programmer]]s have been able to develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).

Within AI, it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a more ambitious one: this distinction was coined by [[John Searle]] in terms of a [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|weak AI and strong AI]]. The exclusive objective of "weak AI", according to Searle, is the successful simulation of mental states, with no attempt to make computers become conscious or aware, etc. The objective of strong AI, on the contrary, is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Searle, John | title=Minds, Brains and Programs | journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | issue=3 | pages=417–424 |year=1980|url=http://cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program of strong AI goes back to one of the pioneers of computation [[Alan Turing]]. As an answer to the question "Can computers think?", he formulated the famous [[Turing test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing believed that a computer could be said to "think" when, if placed in a room by itself next to another room that contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of both the computer and the human being by a third party human being, the computer's responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the human. Essentially, Turing's view of machine intelligence followed the behaviourist model of the mind—intelligence is as intelligence does. The Turing test has received many criticisms, among which the most famous is probably the [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]] formulated by Searle.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;

The question about the possible sensitivity ([[qualia]]) of computers or robots still remains open. Some computer scientists believe that the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to the resolution of the "mind–body problem". They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers, it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain ([[wetware (brain)|wetware]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Russell, S.  |author2=Norvig, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Artificial Intelligence:A Modern Approach | location=New Jersey | publisher=Prentice Hall, Inc. | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-13-103805-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology}}
Psychology is the science that investigates mental states directly. It uses generally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like [[joy]], [[fear]] or [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessions]]. Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychology.org | title=Encyclopedia of Psychology | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513103646/http://www.psychology.org/ | archivedate=2008-05-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this is the [[Perception|psychology of perception]]. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the [[Form perception|perception of forms]]. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other.&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt; This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.

===Cognitive science===
[[Cognitive science]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes.  It examines what [[cognition]] is, what it does, and how it works.  It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It spans many levels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation. [[Mark Rowlands|Rowlands]] argues  that cognition is  enactive, embodied, embedded, affective and (potentially) extended. The position is taken that the "classical sandwich" of cognition sandwiched between perception and action is artificial; cognition has to be seen as a product of a strongly coupled interaction that cannot be divided this way.&lt;ref name=Rowlands&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Rowlands |authorlink=Mark Rowlands |chapter=Chapter 3: The mind embedded |pages=51 ''ff'' |year=2010 |isbn=978-0262014557 |publisher=MIT Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiwjpL-0hDgC&amp;pg=PA51 |title=The new science of the mind: From extended mind to embodied phenomenology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dave Ward |author2=Mog Stapleton |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1E7FogqvJ0C&amp;pg=PA89 |chapter=Es are good.

==Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition==
Most of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called [[analytic philosophy]] (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy).&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dummett, M.| title=Origini della Filosofia Analitica | publisher=Einaudi | year=2001 | isbn=978-88-06-15286-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt; In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, in relation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label ([[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to the discussion of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of [[thought]] and [[experience|perceptual experience]] in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt;

Immanuel Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', first published in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later become known as the philosophy of mind. Kant's first [[critique]] is generally recognized as among the most significant works of [[modern philosophy]] in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both [[Continental philosophy|continental]] and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental]] consciousness, or the life of the mind as conceived through universal [[category (Kant)|categories]] of consciousness.

In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''Philosophy of Mind'' (frequently translated as ''Philosophy of Spirit'' or [[Geist]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hegel, G.W.F | title=Phenomenology of Spirit | isbn=978-0-19-503169-0| year=1983 }}, translated by A.V. Miller with analysis of the text and foreword by J. N. Findlay (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) {{ISBN|0-19-824597-1}} .&lt;/ref&gt; the third part of his ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind: the "subjective mind/spirit", the mind of an individual; the "objective mind/spirit", the mind of society and of the State; and the "Absolute mind/spirit", the position of religion, art, and philosophy. See also Hegel's ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. Nonetheless, Hegel's work differs radically from the style of [[Anglosphere|Anglo-American]] philosophy of mind.

In 1896, [[Henri Bergson]] made in ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' "Essay on the relation of body and spirit" a forceful case for the ontological difference of body and mind by reducing the problem to the more definite one of memory, thus allowing for a solution built on the ''empirical test case'' of [[aphasia]].

In modern times, the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by [[Edmund Husserl]], focuses on the contents of the human mind (see [[noema]]) and how processes shape our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Husserl, Edmund | title=Logische Untersuchungen | isbn=978-3-05-004391-3| year=2008 }} trans.: Giovanni Piana. Milan: EST. {{ISBN|88-428-0949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. See Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'', Merleau-Ponty's ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'', Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and Simone de Beauvoir's ''[[The Second Sex]]''.

===Mind in Hindu philosophy===

====Dualism====
[[Cartesian dualism|Substance Dualism]] is a common feature of several [[Āstika and nāstika#Āstika|orthodox Hindu schools]] including the [[Sāṅkhya]], [[Nyāya]], [[Yoga]] and [[Dvaita Vedanta]]. In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes [[samsara]], a cycle of death and rebirth. The [[Nyāya]] school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/#H2/|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004042359/http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/#H2/|archivedate=2012-10-04|df=}} Nyāya, Matthew R. Dasti&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as [[moksha]], liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.

====Vedanta monistic idealism====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|Śaṅkara]]
In the [[Advaita Vedanta]] of the 8th century Indian philosopher [[Śaṅkara]], the mind, body and world are all held to be the same unchanging eternal conscious entity called [[Brahman]]. Advaita, which means non-dualism, holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute [[consciousness]]. The fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. The only thing that exists is [[Brahman]], which is described as [[Satchitananda]] (Being, consciousness and bliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states "Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101653/http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/|archivedate=2015-06-26|df=}} Advaita Vedanta, Sangeetha Menon&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of monistic Vedanta is [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified non-dualism) as posited by the eleventh century philosopher [[Ramanuja]]. Ramanuja criticized Advaita Vedanta by arguing that consciousness is always [[intentionality|intentional]] and that it is also always a property of something. Ramanuja's Brahman is defined by a multiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity. This doctrine is called "[[samanadhikaranya]]" (several things in a common substrate).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055536/http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|archivedate=2014-07-17|df=}} Ramanuja, Shyam Ranganathan&lt;/ref&gt;

====Materialism====
Arguably the first exposition of [[empiricism|empirical]] [[materialism]] in the history of philosophy is in the [[Cārvāka]] school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the [[four elements]]), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/#H1|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611095345/http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/#H1|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}} Lokāyata/Cārvāka – Indian Materialism, Abigail Turner-Lauck Wernicki&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy of mind===
{{PancaKhandha}}
Buddhist teachings describe that the mind manifests moment-to-moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE Open |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream has been described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

A salient feature of [[Buddhist philosophy]] which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is the centrality of the doctrine of [[Anatta|not-self]] ([[Pāli]]. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous way of looking at the ever-changing stream of [[five aggregates|five interconnected aggregate factors]].&lt;ref name="Coseru"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-indian-buddhism/|title= Coseru, Christian, "Mind in Indian Buddhist Philosophy"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising ([[pratītyasamutpāda]]). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both [[determinism|causal determinist]] and [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalist]] conceptions of mind.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;

====Abhidharma theories of mind====
Three centuries after the death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a large body of literature called the [[Abhidharma]] in several contending [[Buddhist schools]]. In the Abhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as [[prapañca]] ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like [[self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|other]] upon an ever-changing stream of aggregate phenomena.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;
In this conception of mind no strict distinction is made between the conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the [[five senses]] and sixth for perception of mental phenomena.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (''manovijñāna'') and attention (''āvartana''), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.

Rejection of a permanent agent eventually led to the philosophical problems of the seeming continuity of mind and also of explaining how [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] continue to be relevant doctrines without an eternal mind. This challenge was met by the [[Theravāda]] school by introducing the concept of mind as a factor of existence. This "life-stream" ([[Bhavanga]]-sota) is an undercurrent  forming the condition of being. The continuity of a karmic "person" is therefore assured in the form of a [[mindstream]] (citta-santana), a series of flowing mental moments arising from the subliminal life-continuum mind ([[Bhavanga]]-citta), mental content, and attention.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;

====Indian Mahayana====
The [[Sautrāntika]] school held a form of [[phenomenalism]] that saw the world as imperceptible. It held that external objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later [[Yogācāra]] school of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its [[Internalism and externalism#Philosophy of mind|internalist]] stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of [[Vasubandhu]] have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of [[Idealism]]. Vasubandhu uses the [[dream argument]] and a [[mereology|mereological]] refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects as anything other than mental entities.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/|title=Gold, Jonathan C., "Vasubandhu"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201232037/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/|archivedate=2012-12-01|df=}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, [[neutral monism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)#Realist phenomenology|realist phenomenology]].

The Indian [[Schools of Buddhism#Mahāyāna schools|Mahayana schools]] were divided on the issue of the possibility of reflexive awareness (''[[svasaṃvedana]]''). [[Dharmakīrti]] accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogācāra school, comparing it to a lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects. This was strictly rejected by [[Mādhyamika]] scholars like [[Candrakīrti]]. Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by [[Shunyata|emptiness]], they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self-validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker [[Śāntarakṣita]]. In Śāntarakṣita's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the [[two truths doctrine]]. Thus he states: "By relying on the Mind-Only system, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this Middle Way system, know that no self exists at all, even in that [mind]." &lt;ref name="Blumenthal"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/saantarak-sita/|title= Blumenthal, James, "Śāntarakṣita"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (fall 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yogācāra school also developed the theory of the [[Vijñāna#Eight vijñānas|repository consciousness]] (''ālayavijñāna'') to explain continuity of mind in [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and accumulation of [[karma]]. This repository consciousness acts as a storehouse for karmic seeds ([[Bīja|bija]]) when all other senses are absent during the process of death and rebirth as well as being the causal potentiality of [[Dharma (Buddhism)#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmic phenomena]].&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; Thus according to [[B. Alan Wallace]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;No constituents of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental states and processes. Such subjective experiences do not emerge from the body, but neither do they emerge from nothing. Rather, all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate, and all subjective mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;B. Alan Wallace; [https://books.google.com/books?id=WeUYBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity], p. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tibetan Buddhism====
[[Tibetan Buddhist]] theories of mind evolved directly from the Indian Mahayana views. Thus the founder of the [[Gelug]] school, [[Je Tsongkhapa]] discusses the Yogācāra system of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] in his ''Explanation of the Difficult Points''.&lt;ref name="Sparham"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/tsongkhapa/|title= Sparham, Gareth, "Tsongkhapa"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; He would later come to repudiate [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s pragmatic [[idealism]]. 
According to the [[14th Dalai Lama]] the mind can be defined "as an entity that has the nature of mere experience, that is, 'clarity and knowing'. It is the knowing nature, or agency, that is called mind, and this is non-material."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=417|title=Talk by His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Cambridge, MA USA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019213407/http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=417|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}}, From MindScience, edited by Daniel Goleman and Robert F. Thurman, first in 1991 by Wisdom Publications, Boston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneously dual nature of mind is as follows:
:: 1. '''Clarity''' (''gsal'') – The mental activity which produces cognitive phenomena (''snang-ba'').
:: 2. '''Knowing''' (''rig'') – The mental activity of perceiving cognitive phenomena.
The 14th Dalai Lama has also explicitly laid out his theory of mind as '''experiential dualism''' which is described above under the different types of dualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because Tibetan philosophy of mind is ultimately [[soteriology|soteriological]], it focuses on meditative practices such as [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]] that allow a practitioner to experience the true reflexive nature of their mind directly. This unobstructed knowledge of one's primordial, empty and non-dual [[Buddha nature]] is called [[rigpa]].  The mind's innermost nature is described among various schools as pure luminosity or "clear light" ([[Ösel (yoga)|'od gsal]]) and is often compared to a crystal ball or a mirror. [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] speaks of mind thus:
"Imagine a sky, empty, spacious, and pure from the beginning; its essence is like this. Imagine a sun, luminous, clear, unobstructed, and spontaneously present; its nature is like this."

====Zen Buddhism====
The central issue in Chinese Zen philosophy of mind is in the difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind. Chinese Chan master [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huangpo]] described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts.&lt;ref name="Zeuschner"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|title=Zeuschner, Robert B., "The Understanding of Mind in the Northern Line of Ch'an (Zen)"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822105440/http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|archivedate=2012-08-22|df=}}, Philosophy East and West, V. 28, No. 1 (January 1978), pp. 69–79, University of Hawaii Press, Hawaii, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pure Buddha-mind is thus able to see things "as they truly are", as absolute and non-dual "thusness" ([[Tathatā/Dharmatā|Tathatā]]). This non-conceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind, as well as no difference between [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref name="Zeuschner"/&gt;

In the [[Shobogenzo]], the Japanese philosopher [[Dogen]] argued that body and mind are neither ontologically nor phenomenologically distinct but are characterized by a oneness called ''shin jin'' (bodymind). According to Dogen, "casting off body and mind" (''Shinjin datsuraku'') in [[zazen]] will allow one to experience things-as-they-are (''genjokoan'') which is the nature of original enlightenment (''[[hongaku]]'').&lt;ref name="Shaner"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|title=David E. Shaner, "The bodymind experience in Dogen's Shobogenzo: a phenomenological perspective"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822105440/http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|archivedate=2012-08-22|df=}}, Philosophy East and West 35, no. 1 (January 1985), University of Hawaii Press, Hawaii, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics related to philosophy of mind==
There are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of [[death]] and its definitive character, the nature of [[emotion]], of [[perception]] and of [[memory]]. Questions about what a [[person]] is and what his or her [[Personal identity|identity]] consists of also have much to do with the philosophy of mind. There are two subjects that, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: [[free will]] and the [[self (philosophy)|self]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt;

===Free will===
{{Main| Free will}}
In the context of philosophy of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic [[determinism|determinists]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; According to this position, natural laws completely determine the course of the material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.&lt;ref name="Hond"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm | title=Philosopher Ted Honderich's Determinism web resource | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062050/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm | archivedate=2008-05-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argumentation is rejected, on the one hand, by the [[compatibilism|compatibilists]]. Those who adopt this position suggest that the question "Are we free?" can only be answered once we have determined what the term "free" means. The opposite of "free" is not "caused" but "compelled" or "coerced". It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination. A free act is one where the agent could have done otherwise if it had chosen otherwise. In this sense a person can be free even though determinism is true.&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt; The most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Paul, ''Freedom and Moral Sentiment: Hume's Way of Naturalizing Responsibility'' Oxford University Press: New York &amp; Oxford, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, this position is defended, for example, by [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dennett, Daniel | title=The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting | publisher=Bradford Books–MIT Press |location=Cambridge MA | year=1984 |isbn=978-0-262-54042-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are also many [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]] who reject the argument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt; These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Descartes|year=1649|title=Passions of the Soul|isbn=978-0-87220-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=Robert |year=2009 |title=Libertarianism |journal=Philosophical Studies |volume=144 |issue=1 |page=39 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2vg712u87804766 |doi= 10.1007/s11098-009-9365-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Libertarianism, the will does not have to be deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt;

===Self===
{{Main|Philosophy of self}}
The philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of "self". If by "self" or "I" one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the ''person'', some modern philosophers of mind, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered an illusion.&lt;ref name="DHof"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dennett, C.  |author2=Hofstadter, D.R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Mind's I | publisher=Bantam Books | year=1981 |isbn=978-0-553-01412-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the idea of an [[soul|immaterial soul]]. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of "self" as postulated by [[David Hume]], who could never catch himself ''not'' doing, thinking or feeling anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Searle, John | title=Mind: A Brief Introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press Inc, USA  | date=1 November 2004|isbn=978-0-19-515733-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the light of empirical results from [[developmental psychology]], [[developmental biology]] and [[neuroscience]], the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=LeDoux, Joseph | title=The Synaptic Self | location=New York | publisher=Viking Penguin | year=2002 | isbn=978-88-7078-795-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''physical law''' or a '''law of [[physics]]''' is a statement "[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present."&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]]. These terms are not used the same way by all authors.

The distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use "physical law" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists. See Norman Swartz, ''The Concept of Physical Law'' (New York: Cambridge University Press), 1985. Second edition available online [https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Several general properties of physical laws have been identified. Physical laws are:

* True, at least within their regime of validity. By definition, there have never been repeatable contradicting observations.&lt;!--concept pre-existing in article--&gt;
* Universal. They appear to apply everywhere in the universe.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=The mind of God : the scientific basis for a rational world|date=2005|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-671-79718-8|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}
* Simple. They are typically expressed in terms of a single mathematical equation.
* Absolute. Nothing in the universe appears to affect them.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;{{rp|82}}
* Stable. Unchanged since first discovered (although they may have been shown to be approximations of more accurate laws—see "[[Physical law#Laws as approximations|Laws as approximations]]" below),
* Omnipotent. Everything in the universe apparently must comply with them (according to observations).&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;{{rp|83}}
* Generally [[Conservation law (physics)|conservative]] of quantity.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=The character of physical law|date=1994|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-60127-2|edition=Modern Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59}}
* Often expressions of existing homogeneities ([[symmetries]]) of [[space]] and time.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;
* Typically theoretically reversible in time (if non-[[quantum mechanics|quantum]]), although [[arrow of time|time itself is irreversible]].&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;

== Examples ==
{{main|List of laws in science}}
{{See also|Scientific laws named after people}}

Some of the more famous laws of nature are found in [[Isaac Newton]]'s theories of (now) [[classical mechanics]], presented in his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', and in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. Other examples of laws of nature include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]], the four laws of [[thermodynamics]], etc.

==Laws as definitions==
Many scientific laws are couched in mathematical terms (e.g. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}, or the [[uncertainty principle]], or the [[principle of least action]], or [[causality]]). While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not "mathematical" laws. (Mathematical laws can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment.)

== Laws being consequences of mathematical symmetries==
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}
Other laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (say, [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[space–time]]). Laws are constantly being checked experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed.

Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, but the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies can be said to generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations (see below), to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.

Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose–Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].

The [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].

One strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.

== Laws as approximations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Physical law]] --&gt;
Some laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, Newtonian dynamics (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.

== History ==
Compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature fill the role played by [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.

The observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes—such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena—to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.

In Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.&lt;blockquote&gt;The formula "law of nature" first appears as "a live metaphor" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,&lt;ref&gt;in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, "When Nature Got its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley, "When Nature Got Its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[René Descartes]] described "nature" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts "are to be attributed to nature. The rules according to which these changes take place I call the 'laws of nature'."&lt;ref name="bertie.ccsu.edu7"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cosmological Revolution V: Descartes and Newton | website=bertie.ccsu.edu | url=http://bertie.ccsu.edu/naturesci/Cosmology/Cosmo5Newton.html | accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The modern [[scientific method]] which took shape at this time (with [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) aimed at total separation of science from theology, with minimal speculation about [[metaphysics]] and ethics. [[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).

== Other fields ==
Some [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.

Examples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius–Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as "laws". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">In [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], '''Planck's principle''' is the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views.

The reason for the name is the statements by [[Max Planck]]:&lt;ref&gt;Planck, Max K. (1950). Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers. New York: Philosophical library.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it|sign=Max Planck|source=Scientific autobiography, 1950, p. 33}}

What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.|sign=Max Planck|source=Scientific autobiography, 1950, p. 97}}

Planck's quote has been used by [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Paul Feyerabend]] and others to argue that [[scientific revolutions]] are arational, rather than spreading through "mere force of truth and fact".&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hull DL, Tessner PD, Diamond AM |title=Planck's Principle |journal=Science |date=17 November 1978 |volume=202 |issue=4369 |pages=717–23 |doi=10.1126/science.202.4369.717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

Graff Zivin: Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time? 2015, {{doi|10.3386/w21788}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as [[Darwinian]] rather than [[Lamarckian]] conceptual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John T.

Whether age influences the readiness to accept new ideas has been empirically criticised. In the case of acceptance of [[evolution]] in the years after Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' age was a minor factor.&lt;ref name="Hull"/&gt; Similarly, it was a weak factor in accepting [[cliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arthur M.

A '''polar concept argument''' is a type of [[argument]] that posits the understanding of one concept, from the mere understanding of its [[wikt:polar opposite|polar opposite]]. A well-known instance of a polar concept argument is [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s argument against scepticism (1960). According to Anthony Grayling's characterisation, Ryle's argument can be stated as follows:

:''There cannot be counterfeit coins, (...) unless there are genuine ones, nor crooked paths unless there are straight paths, nor tall men unless there are short men''.

According to Ryle's polar concept argument, counterfeit and genuine coins come in pairs, and one cannot conceive of counterfeit coins without also capturing the essence of the genuine coins at the same time. When one grasps the essence of one polar concept, one also grasps immediately the essence of its polar opposite. Ryle's original argument (1960) runs as follows:

:''A country which had no coinage would offer no scope to counterfeiters. There would be nothing for them to manufacture or pass counterfeits of. They could, if they wished, manufacture and give away decorated disks of brass or lead, which the public might be pleased to get. But these would not be false coins. There can be false coins only where there are coins made of the proper materials by the proper authorities. In a country where there is a coinage, false coins can be manufactured and passed; and the counterfeiting might be so efficient that an ordinary citizen, unable to tell which were false and which were genuine coins, might become suspicious of the genuineness of any particular coin that he received.''

A polar concept argument bears on some more or less strong version of [[dialectical monism]], a philosophical doctrine that views reality as a unified whole, due to the complementarity of [[polar concepts]].

A '''principle''' is a concept or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. In [[law]], it is a [[Legal rule|rule]] that has to be or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in  nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Alpa, Guido (1994) [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol1/iss1/2/ General Principles of Law], ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law'', Vol. 1: Is. 1, Article 2. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's [[IBM System/360 architecture|360/370]] ''Principles of Operation''.

Examples of principles are, [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]] in a number of fields, [[least action]] in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: [[doctrine]]s or assumptions forming  normative rules of conduct, [[separation of church and state]] in statecraft, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]] in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the [[territorial principle]], [[homestead principle]], and [[precautionary principle]].

===As scientific law===
[[Archimedes principle]], relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a  [[law (principle)|law]] in science. Another early one developed by [[Malthus]] is the ''population principle'', now called the [[Malthusian principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W.  [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Malthus1.htm "T. Robert Mathus's Principle ...."] ''Rogers State University''.  2013.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also wrote on principles, especially the [[reality principle]] necessary to keep the id and [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in check. Biologists use the [[principle of priority]] and [[principle of Binominal nomenclature]] for precision in naming [[species]]. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in [[cosmology]] which observes the [[mediocrity principle]], the [[anthropic principle]], the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[cosmological principle]]. Other well-known principles include the [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[pigeonhole principle]] and [[superposition principle]] in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===
{{Main|Principle of sufficient reason}}
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ "Principle of Sufficient Reason."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  7 September 2016.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity ''x'', if ''x'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''x'' exists.
:For every event ''e'', if ''e'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''e'' occurs.
:For every proposition ''p'', if ''p'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''p'' is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
{{Main|Law of noncontradiction}}
According to [[Aristotle]], “It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/ "Aristotle on Non-contradiction."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  12 June 2015.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it rains and doesn't rain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Aristotle/aristotle_laws_of_thought.html "Great Philosophers."] ''Oregon State University''.  2002.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle of excluded middle===
{{Main|Law of excluded middle}}
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as: either ''A'' is ''B'' or ''A'' isn't ''B''. It is read the following way: either ''P'' is true, or its denial ¬''P'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001|title=Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead ... and Bertrand Russell.|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known as "''tertium non datur''" ('A third (thing) is not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no contradiction and sufficient reason).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12519">The '''principle of transformation groups''' is a rule for assigning ''epistemic'' probabilities in a statistical inference problem.  It was first suggested by [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Edwin T. Jaynes]] &lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prior.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen as a generalisation of the [[principle of indifference]].

This can be seen as a method to create ''objective ignorance probabilities'' in the sense that two people who apply the principle and are confronted with the same information will assign the same probabilities.

== Motivation and description of the method ==
The method is motivated by the following normative principle, or desideratum:

''In two problems where we have the same prior information we should assign the same prior probabilities''

The method then comes about from "transforming" a given problem into an equivalent one.  This method has close connections with [[group theory]], and to a large extent is about finding symmetry in a given problem, and then exploiting this symmetry to assign prior probabilities.

In problems with discrete variables (e.g. dice, cards, categorical data) the principle reduces to the [[principle of indifference]], as the "symmetry" in the discrete case is a permutation of the labels, that is the [[permutation group]] is the relevant transformation group for this problem.

In problems with continuous variables, this method generally reduces to solving a [[differential equation]].  Given that differential equations do not always lead to unique solutions, this method cannot be guaranteed to produce a unique solution.  However, in a large class of the most common types of parameters it does lead to unique solutions (see the examples below)

== Examples ==
=== Discrete Case - coin flipping ===
Consider a problem where all you are told is that there is a coin, and it has a head (H) and a tail (T).  Denote this information by ''I''.  You are then asked "what is the probability of Heads?".  Call this ''problem 1'' and denote the probability ''P(H|I)''.  Consider another question "what is the probability of Tails?".  Call this ''problem 2'' and denote this probability by ''P(T|I)''.

Now from the information which was actually in the question, there is no distinction between heads and tails.  The whole paragraph above could be re-written with "Heads" and "Tails" interchanged, and "H" and "T" interchanged, and the problem statement would not be any different.  Using the desideratum then demands that

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I)=P(T|I)&lt;/math&gt;

The probabilities must add to 1, this means that

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I)+P(T|I)=1 \rightarrow 2 P(H|I)=1 \rightarrow P(H|I)=0.5 &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus we have a unique solution.  This argument easily extents to ''N'' categories, to give the "flat" prior probability ''1/N''.
This provides a ''consistency'' based argument to the principle of indifference which goes as follows: ''if someone is truly ignorant about a discrete/countable set of outcomes apart from their potential existence, but does not assign them equal prior probabilities, then they are assigning different probabilities when given the same information''.

This can be alternatively phrased as: ''a person who does not use the principle of indifference to assign prior probabilities to discrete variables, is either not ignorant about them, or reasoning inconsistently''.

===Continuous Case - location parameter===

This is the easiest example for continuous variables.  It is given by stating one is "ignorant" of the location parameter in a given problem.  The statement that a parameter is a "location parameter" is that the sampling distribution, or likelihood of an observation ''X'' depends on a parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; only through the difference

&lt;math&gt;p(X|\mu,I)=f(X-\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

for some normalised, but otherwise arbitrary distribution ''f(.)''.  Examples of location parameters include mean parameter of [[normal distribution]] with known variance and median parameter of [[Cauchy distribution]] with known inter-quartile range.
The two "equivalent problems" in this case, given ones knowledge of the sampling distribution &lt;math&gt;p(X|\mu,I)=f(X-\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, but no other knowledge about &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, is simply given by a "shift" of equal magnitude in ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  This is because of the relation:

&lt;math&gt; f(X-\mu)=f([X+b]-[\mu+b])=f(X^{(1)}-\mu^{(1)}) &lt;/math&gt;

So simply "shifting" all quantities up by some number ''b'' and solving in the "shifted space" and then "shifting" back to the original one should give exactly the same answer as if we just worked on the original space.  Making the transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mu^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of simply 1, and so the prior probability &lt;math&gt;g(\mu) = p(\mu|I)&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the functional equation:

&lt;math&gt;g(\mu)=\left|{\partial \mu^{(1)} \over \partial \mu}\right| g(\mu^{(1)}) = g(\mu+b)&lt;/math&gt;

And the only function which satisfies this equation is the "constant prior":

&lt;math&gt;p(\mu|I) \propto 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the uniform prior is justified for expressing complete ignorance of a location parameter.

===Continuous case - scale parameter===

As in the above argument, a statement that &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a scale parameter means that the sampling distribution has the functional form:

&lt;math&gt;p(X|\sigma,I)={1 \over \sigma}f\left({X \over \sigma}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where, as before ''f(.)'' is a normalised probability density function.  The requirement that probabilities be finite and positive forces the condition &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Examples include the standard deviation of a normal distribution with known mean, the [[gamma distribution]].  The "symmetry" in this problem is found by noting that

&lt;math&gt;{X \over \sigma}={X a \over \sigma a} ; a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

But, unlike in the location parameter case, the Jacobian of this transformation in the sample space and the parameter space is ''a'', not 1.  so the [[sampling probability]] changes to:

&lt;math&gt;p(X^{(1)}|\sigma,I)={1 \over a} \cdot {1 \over \sigma}f\left({X a \over \sigma a}\right)= {1 \over \sigma^{(1)}}f\left({X^{(1)} \over \sigma^{(1)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is invariant (i.e. has the same form before and after the transformation), and the prior probability changes to:

&lt;math&gt;p(\sigma|I)={1 \over a} p(\sigma^{(1)}|I)={1 \over a}p\left({\sigma \over a}|I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which has the unique solution (up to a proportionality constant):

&lt;math&gt;p(\sigma|I) \propto {1 \over \sigma} \rightarrow p(\log(\sigma)|I) \propto 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Which is the well-known [[Jeffreys prior]] for scale parameters, which is "flat" on the log scale, although it should be noted that it is derived using a different argument to that here, based on the [[Fisher information]] function.  The fact that these two methods give the same results in this case does not imply it in general.

===Continuous case - Bertrand's paradox===
Edwin Jaynes used this principle to provide a resolution to [[Bertrand paradox (probability)|Bertrand's Paradox]]&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/well.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
by stating his ignorance about the exact position of the circle.  The details are available in the reference or in the link.

== Discussion ==

This argument depends crucially on ''I''; changing the information may result in a different probability assignment.  It is just as crucial as changing [[axioms]] in [[deductive logic]] - small changes in the information can lead to large changes in the probability assignments allowed by "consistent reasoning".

To illustrate suppose that the coin flipping example also states as part of the information that the coin has a side (S) (i.e. it is a ''real coin'').  Denote this new information by ''N''.  The same argument using "complete ignorance", or more precisely, the information actually described, gives:

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I,N)=P(T|I,N)=P(S|I,N)=1/3 &lt;/math&gt;

But this seems absurd to most people - intuition tells us that we should have P(S) very close to zero.  This is because most people's intuition do not see "symmetry" between a coin landing on its side compared to landing on heads.  Our intuition says that the particular "labels" actually carry some information about the problem.  A simple argument could be used to make this more formal mathematically (e.g. the physics of the problem make it difficult for a flipped coin to land on its side) - we make a distinction between "thick" coins and "thin" coins [here thickness is measured relative to the coin's diameter].  It could reasonably be assumed that:

&lt;math&gt;P(S|\text{thin coin}) \neq P(S|\text{thick coin})&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this new information probably wouldn't break the symmetry between "heads" and "tails", so ''that'' permutation would still apply in describing "equivalent problems", and we would require:

&lt;math&gt;P(T|\text{thin coin}) = P(H|\text{thin coin}) \neq P(H|\text{thick coin})=P(T|\text{thick coin})&lt;/math&gt;

This is a good example of how the principle of transformation groups can be used to "flesh out" personal opinions.  All of the information used in the derivation is explicitly stated.  If a prior probability assignment doesn't "seem right" according to what your intuition tells you, then there must be some "background information" which has not been put into the problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmonkeys.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is then the task to try and work out what that information is.  In some sense, by combining the method of transformation groups with one's intuition can be used to "weed out" the actual assumptions one has.  This makes it a very powerful tool for prior elicitation.

Introducing the thickness of the coin is permissible because it was not specified in the problem, so this is still only using information in the question{{Huh|date=December 2017}}. Introducing a "nuisance parameter" and then making the answer invariant to this parameter is a very useful technique for solving supposedly "ill-posed" problems like Bertrand's Paradox.  This has been called "the well-posing strategy" by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/519028 |jstor=519028 |title=Bertrand's Paradox and the Principle of Indifference |year=2007 |last1=Shackel |first1=Nicholas |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=150|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/3803/1/Shackel%20Bertrand%27s%20paradox%205.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real power of this principle lies in its application to continuous parameters, where the notion of "complete ignorance" is not so well defined as in the discrete case.  However, if applied with infinite limits, it often gives [[improper prior]] distributions.  Note that the discrete case for a countably infinite set, such as (0,1,2,...) also produces an improper discrete prior.  For most cases where the likelihood is sufficiently "steep" this does not present a problem.  However, in order to be absolutely sure to avoid incoherent results and paradoxes, the prior distribution should be approached via a well defined and well behaved limiting process.  One such process is the use of a sequence of priors with increasing range, such as &lt;math&gt;f(M) = {I(M \in [-b,b]) \over 2b}&lt;/math&gt; where the limit &lt;math&gt;b \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; is to be taken ''at the end of the calculation'' i.e. after the normalisation of the posterior distribution.  What this effectively is doing, is ensuring that one is taking the limit of the ratio, and not the ratio of two limits.  See [[Limit of a function#Properties]] for details on limits and why this order of operations is important.

If the limit of the ratio does not exist or diverges, then this gives an improper posterior (i.e. a posterior which does not integrate to one).  This indicates that the data are so uninformative about the parameters that the prior probability of arbitrarily large values still matters in the final answer.  In some sense, an improper posterior means that the information contained in the data has not "ruled out" arbitrarily large values.  Looking at the improper priors this way, it seems to make some sense that "complete ignorance" priors should be improper, because the information used to derive them is so meager that it cannot rule out absurd values on its own.  From a state of complete ignorance, only the data or some other form of additional information can rule out such absurdities.

A '''process reference model''' is a [[Conceptual model|model]] that has generic functionality and can be used more than once in different models. The creator of a process model benefits from existing process reference models by not needing to reinvent the process model but only reusing it as a starting point in creating a process model for a specific purpose.

==Process model reuse==
During the identification of processes ideal for reuse, the designer needs to (1) Get approval (2) Provide Organization Scope Context and (3) Identify Process [[Standardization]] Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Marne de Vries, Alta van der Merwe, Paula Kotze and Aurona Gerber.

The '''psychotherapy and social action model''' is an approach to [[psychotherapy]] characterized by concentration on past and present personal, social, and political obstacles to [[mental health]]. In particular, the goal of this therapeutic approach is to acknowledge that individual symptoms are not unique, but rather shared by people similarly oppressed and marginalized. Ultimately, the psychotherapy and social action model aims to aid clients in overcoming [[mental illness]] through personal psychotherapy, group [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], and collective social action.

==Background==
	The psychotherapy and social action model was initially proposed by Sue Holland, a [[psychotherapist]] with a background in community action. Holland developed this framework in 1980 following her experience working with women coping with psychological disorders at a housing estate in West London.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; At this estate, Holland observed the psychological difficulties experienced by women, noticing that their mental health was fundamentally tied to the social and economic obstacles they encountered as females in their society. In addition, Holland took issue with the way [[Depression (mood)]] was being treated at the shelter, believing that individualized treatment, especially with the use of psychotropic medication, was not successfully addressing the root of the dysfunction for these women. Instead, Holland posited a pathway from individual treatment to sociopolitical action that empowered women to deal with their mental dysfunction both privately and socially. As such, the psychotherapy and social action model is rooted in the ideals of both traditional psychotherapy and [[Feminism|feminist]] empowerment.

	Implementation of the model began with a three-year trial run and, according to Holland (1992), achieved its three initial goals, including providing private focused psychotherapy, promoting mental health, and fostering community continuity. There was initial evidence supporting the efficacy of the model in treating individual psychological dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==

The square model derives from the sociological theory of the four paradigms for the analysis of social theory.&lt;ref&gt;Burrell, G. &amp; Morgan, G. (1979). Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the frame of the model, the dichotomy of individual versus social approaches to personal well-being is represented. The two bottom cells of the square delineate the changing of individuals to conform to social convention while the two top cells of the square represent the changing of social structures as opposed to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Orford, J. (2008). Community Psychology: challenges, controversies and emerging consensus (Illustrated ed.). London: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four cells within the frame represent the four paradigms of social theory including functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist, and radical structuralist paradigms. [[Functional psychology|Functionalism]] here is rooted in regulation and objective thinking, and represents the individual, status-quo approach to mental health. The interpretive paradigm is characterized by an approach to understanding the social world through subjective experience, and represents psychoeducation within the psychotherapy framework. The radical humanist paradigm is defined by a radial approach to change with an emphasis on “transcending limitations of existing social arrangements.” (Burrell &amp; Morgan, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;32). With respect to an approach to therapy, this stage is characterized by the adoption of a social self, such that healing occurs at a group or collective level. The radical structuralist paradigm concentrates on radical change through political or economic emancipation. This is the endpoint of therapy, at which time the client is empowered to challenge sociopolitical structures that foster the conditions perpetuating the manifestation of individual mental illness within an oppressed group.

Taken from her 1992 publication entitled, “From Social Abuse to Social Action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women,” Holland formulated her four step approach to mental health and social action for women in treatment for depression as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

===I. Patient on Pills===
At this stage, patients endorse the status-quo characterization of the “individualized patient.” As such, they treat their disorder passively with psychotropic medication and accept the label associated with their illness.

===II. Person-to-Person Psychotherapy===
This stage represents the first alternative to the status-quo treatment of psychiatric disorders: [[talk therapy]]. At this stage, clients and therapists are able to explore the meaning of their psychopathology and pinpoint the potential causes through individual therapy.

===III. Talking in Groups===
At this stage, the client is able to move past the personal challenges that are acknowledged and addressed in psychotherapy and discover that the challenges are universal amongst similarly marginalized individuals. Together, clients aim to acknowledge what is best for the collective.

===IV. Taking Action===
The final stage, as the name suggests, is the point at which the collective mobilizes to change the social structures enabling their common oppression. Having changed from an individual to a collective, the clients should feel empowered to undertake social change.

Included in this framework is the assumption that only some of the clients in this therapy will traverse all three stages. In Holland’s words, “…many will be content enough with the relief from symptoms and the freedom to get on with their personal lives which the individual therapy gives them.” (Holland, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;73). Thus, this framework is fluid based on the personal inclinations of the client throughout the therapeutic process.

'''Pythagorean Method of Memorization''' ('''PYMOM'''), also known as '''Triangular Movement Cycle''' ('''TMC'''), is a game-based, educational methodology or [[associative learning|associative-learning]] technique that primarily uses corresponding information, such as terms and definitions on opposing sides, displayed on [[cue cards]], to exploit psychological retention of information for academic study and language acquisition. PYMOM is named such because of the shape the cue-cards form during the progression of the game, a right-angled or [[Pythagorean triangle|Pythagorean]] triangle.&lt;ref name=PsychologyOfStudy&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cecil Alec Mace|title=The Psychology of Study|date=1968|publisher=Penguin|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=NLzKrQEACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Pythagorean+Method+of+Memorization%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BHFUVbL3KoGAzAOw9oHoCA&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gospels&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig S.

It is a [[theoretical]] educational method that is made up of several established and tested educational methods that have been in use for decades.&lt;ref name=huffington /&gt;&lt;ref name=Life-of-Pythagoras /&gt;&lt;ref name=toolsforeasyliving /&gt;

==Methodology==
PYMOM is a composite body of techniques that claims, in its digital form, to incorporate (to a greater or lesser degree): spaced repetition, non-failure redundant subroutine, [[chromatics]]{{dn|date=November 2016}}, positive reinforcement, the [[Von Restorff effect]], picture association, selective musical tonality, [[kinesthetics]], the [[serial-position effect]] and [[meditation]]. There are two branches of this methodology:&lt;ref name=Life-of-Pythagoras&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Taylor|author2=Iamblichus|title=Iamblichus' Life of Pythagoras|date=1813|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=EB5UvHrdMpsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;hl=ar#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toolsforeasyliving&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robert A.

#the historical, physical incarnation, the Triangular Movement Cycle and
#the digitized version, incorporating the significant addition of the aforementioned educational methods and theories, Pythagorean Method of Memorization.

==Process &amp; application==
As with both branches, there is only one variable in the game or learning method: a correct or incorrect answer. The initial movement cycle also remains largely unchanged.&lt;ref name=Gospels /&gt;&lt;ref name=mantelligence /&gt;

The movement cycle which is most crucial to the methodology and reinforces the spaced repetition, begins with either 3, 4 or 5 cards; 3 cards for a 6-card session, 4 cards for a 10-card session and 5 cards for the most advanced 15-card session. Because two-sided associative cue-cards are being used, all cards are presented with a congruent side up, either all "terms" or "definitions," not mixed.&lt;ref name=Gospels /&gt;&lt;ref name=mantelligence /&gt;

Once cards have been answered correctly, the predominant row has reached its maximum and a card must be graduated out of this row to continue the game. Thus the card to the far right comes into play.  Routines are repeated as each row reaches its maximum. A cue-card is finally eliminated from the game session by being answered correctly once more, after it has graduated to the top tier or row.&lt;ref name=Gospels /&gt;&lt;ref name=youlearn /&gt;&lt;ref name=mantelligence /&gt;

===Triangular Movement Cycle===
{{One source section|date=March 2017}}
The first manifestation, referred to as the "Triangular Movement Cycle" or TMC, was a simple paper-based learning technique that was primarily a manual movement cycle using physical cue-cards, which allowed for manual-spaced repetition to elicit psychological retention of information. Its origins, however, are not very clear. Using TMC, teachers would move the cards for the student in a one-on-one setting according to either the correct or incorrect feedback from the student.This presented challenges for the teacher or tutor using this method. The first challenge lies in the fact that, although TMC lent itself well to a two-party learning group (i.e. teacher &amp; student), it could also be done by the student themselves on their own. It was a very easy system to utilize once learned, however, it was found exceptionally difficult to teach the complex movement cycle and principles behind such to students, especially where a linguistic barrier was present. The second challenge lay in that the educator needed to create and remember innumerable cue-cards or create custom master lists in order to know the correct answers — and properly guide the student, thus progressing or digressing the card in play. TMC often failed to keep the attention of many students owing to the fact that cards were not very visually appealing. To make them so required tremendous effort — and was very time consuming.&lt;ref name=youlearn /&gt;

The term "Pythagorean Method of Memorization" was coined in 2013 and officially copyrighted in October 2014 by a Canadian company named You Learn Educational Solutions &amp; Linguistics Inc. PYMOM takes the movement cycle from TMC and remedied the challenge of teaching the movement cycle itself to students by providing a software-based solution to handling cycles by means of sub-routines prompted by the user’s input.&lt;ref name=youlearn&gt;{{cite news|title=Pythagorean Method of Memorization|url=https://youlearnacademy.com/blog/2015/04/pythagorean-method-of-memorization/|accessdate=14 May 2015|publisher=You Learn Academy|date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PYMOM wove established educational theory into the fabric of TMC to create a viable educational platform for academic and linguistic study by several means. Because spaced repetition is intrinsically part of the movement-cycle subroutines, it adds to the content and surrounding experience making it into a platform. The developers of PYMOM describe it as an “organic learning experience.” The tenets that truly allow a learning system to be a PYMOM-based system are enumerated thusly: The Von Restorff effect: for example, where it features a language, this method is employed to further aid in memory retention of the highlighted word in the phrase.&lt;ref name=youlearn /&gt;

*Chromatics: there are no white backgrounds where learning takes place.
*Positive Reinforcement: There are no truly "wrong" responses, only mistakes. These mistakes are greeted by neutral reinforcement and "correct" responses are rewarded with positive reinforcement.
*Picture Association: Visual aids should accompany concept-based material.
*Selective Musical Tonality: the learning experience should always incorporate music; generally instrumental, that aids learning by increasing focus and reducing stress (which inhibits learning).
*Kinesthetics: whether by utilizing a touch-screen, key board or mouse, a level of physical movement should always be present while learning to further increase retention.
*The Serial Position Effect: taking breaks at specific, regular intervals to aid in learning and reduce stress levels.
*Meditation: a session of meditation should be incorporated into every learning session to allow for further retention of the information.

'''Search neutrality''' is a [[principle]] that [[search engine]]s should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=The New York Times | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain [[bias]]. 
 
Search neutrality is related to [[network neutrality]] in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet. Search neutrality aims to keep the [[organic search]] results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.

==Background==
The term "search neutrality" in context of the internet appears as early as March 2009 in an academic paper by Andrew Odlyzko titled, "Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets"&lt;ref name="odlyzko"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Odlyzko|first1=Andrew|title=Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets|journal=Review of Network Economics|date=March 2009|pages=40-60|url=https://www.bsi.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/rne81.pdf|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this paper, Odlykzo predicts that if net neutrality were to be accepted as a legal or regulatory principle, then the questions surrounding search neutrality would be the next controversies. Indeed, in December 2009 the New York Times published an opinion letter by Foundem co-founder and lead complainant in an anti-trust complaint against Google, Adam Raff, which likely brought the term to the broader public. According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be "the [[principle]] that [[search engines]] should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]]"&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=The New York Times | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices &lt;ref name=raff1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|website=searchneutrality.org|title=About SearchNeutrality.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804021604/http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as "search neutrality" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality&lt;ref name="raff1" /&gt;.

In contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as "what is search neutrality?" or "what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?", appear to have less consensus. The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality &lt;ref name=grimmelmann&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1742444|title=Some Skepticism about Search Neutrality|work=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|pages=435-461|accessdate=5 July 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt;. Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other [[information retrieval]] applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking). "Relevance" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results. Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences. And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.

Search neutrality became a concern after [[search engines]], most notably [[Google]], were accused of search bias by other companies.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lao|first1=Marina|title="Neutral" Search As A Basis for Antitrust Action?|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology Occasional Paper Series|date=July 2013|pages=1–12|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/antitrust/articles/Lao.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herman|first1=Tavani|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|title=Search Engines and Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2014|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/ethics-search/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines. Sites like [[Amazon.com]] and [[Facebook]] are also accused of skewing results.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shavin|first1=Naomi|title=Are Google and Amazon the next threat to net neutrality?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/naomishavin/2014/07/02/are-google-and-amazon-the-next-threat-to-net-neutrality/|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon’s search results are influenced by companies that pay to rank higher in their search results while Facebook filters their newsfeed lists to conduct social experiments.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

== "Vertical search" spam penalties ==
In order to find information on the Web, most users make use of [[search engines]], which [[web crawler|crawl the web]], index it and show a list of results ordered by relevance. The use of search engines to access information through the web has become a key factor for [[online business]]es companies, which depend on the flow of users visiting their pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marketingtoday.com/emarketing/0305/b2b_importance_sem.htm| title=Search Engine Marketing | publisher=Marketing Today | year=2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these companies is Foundem. Foundem provides a "[[vertical search]]" service to compare products available on online markets for the U.K. Many people see these "vertical search" sites as spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antitrust nemesis accuses Google of 'WMD program'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/01/foundem_accuses_google_of_wmd_program_against_vertical_search_rivals/|work=The Register|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Cade Metz|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006 and for three and a half years following, Foundem’s traffic and business dropped significantly due to what they assert to be a penalty deliberately applied by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/foundem-google-story| title=Foundem’s Google Story| publisher=www.searchneutrality.org| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127070002/http://www.searchneutrality.org/foundem-google-story |archivedate=27 January 2010 | year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear, however, whether their claim of a penalty was self-imposed via their use of iframe HTML tags to embed the content from other websites.  At the time at which Foundem claims the penalties were imposed, it was unclear whether web crawlers crawled beyond the main page of a website using iframe tags without some extra modifications. The former SEO director OMD UK, Jaamit Durrani, among others, offered this alternative explanation, stating that “Two of the major issues that Foundem had in summer was content in iFrames and content requiring javascript to load – both of which I looked at in August, and they were definitely in place. Both are huge barriers to search visibility in my book. They have been fixed somewhere between then and the lifting of the supposed ‘penalty’. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.”&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title = Foundem vs Google redux: it was a penalty!

Most of Foundem’s accusations claim that Google deliberately applies penalties to other vertical search engines because they represent competition.&lt;ref name="policyBlog"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/02/committed-to-competing-fairly.html | title=Committed to competing fairly| publisher=[[Google]] | year=2010 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundem is backed by a Microsoft proxy group, the 'Initiative for Competitive Online Marketplace'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Conducting Antitrust Review of Google|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/204857/texas_conducting_antitrust_review_of_google.html|work=PC World|publisher=IDG Consumer and SMB|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Nancy Gohring|date=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other cases====
[[Google]]'s large market share (85%) has made them a target for search neutrality litigation via [[antitrust laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/ | title=Background to EU Formal Investigation | publisher=foundem | date=November 30, 2010 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, Google released an article on the Google Public Policy blog expressing their concern for fair competition, when other companies at the UK joined Foundem's cause (eJustice.fr, and Microsoft's Ciao! from Bing) also claiming being unfairly penalized by Google.&lt;ref name="policyBlog" /&gt;

===The FTC’s Investigation into Allegations of Search Bias===

After two years of looking into claims that Google “manipulated its search algorithms to harm vertical websites and unfairly promote its own competing vertical properties,” the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) voted unanimously to end the antitrust portion of its investigation without filing a formal complaint against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Agrees to Change Its Business Practices to Resolve FTC Competition Concerns In the Markets for Devices Like Smart Phones, Games and Tablets, and in Online Search|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/01/google-agrees-change-its-business-practices-resolve-ftc|website=FTC.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC concluded that Google’s “practice of favoring its own content in the presentation of search results” did not violate U.S. antitrust laws.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"/&gt; The FTC further determined that even though competitors might be negatively impacted by Google's changing algorithms, Google did not change its algorithms to hurt competitors, but as a product improvement to benefit consumers.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"/&gt;

== Arguments ==
There are a number of arguments for and against search neutrality.

=== Pros ===
* Those who advocate search neutrality argue that the results would not be biased towards sites with more advertising, but towards sites most relevant to the user.&lt;ref name="Concurring Opinions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2011/02/search-neutrality-as-disclosure-and-auditing.html | title=Search Neutrality as Disclosure and Auditing | publisher=Concurring Opinions | date=February 19, 2011 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Search neutrality encourages sites to have more quality content rather than pay to rank higher on organic results.
* Restrains search engines from only supporting their best advertisers.&lt;ref name="Concurring Opinions"/&gt;
* Search engines would allow traffic to sites that depend on visitors, keeping their results comprehensive, impartial, and based solely on relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html?_r=1 | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=Bucknell.edu | date=December 27, 2009 | accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann"&gt;{{cite book | last=Grimmelmann | first=James | chapterurl=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=james_grimmelmann | title=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet | chapter=Some Skepticism About Search Neutrality | publisher=TechFreedom | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allows for organized, logical manipulation of search results by an objective, automatic algorithm.  At the same time, disallowing underhanded ranking of results on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann"/&gt;
* Personalized search results might suppress information that disagrees with users' [[worldview]]s, isolating them in their own cultural or ideological "[[filter bubble]]s".&lt;ref name=twsT43&gt;{{cite news|first1= Lynn | last1= Parramore|title= The Filter Bubble|work= The Atlantic|quote= Since Dec. 4, 2009, Google has been personalized for everyone. So when I had two friends this spring Google "BP," one of them got a set of links that was about investment opportunities in BP. The other one got information about the oil spill....|date=  October 10, 2010|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2010/10/the-filter-bubble/181427/|accessdate= April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cons ===
*Forcing search engines to treat all websites equally would lead to the removal of their biased look at the Internet. A biased view of the Internet is exactly what search users are seeking. By performing a search the user is seeking what that search engine perceives as the "best" result to their query. Enforced search neutrality would, essentially, remove this bias. Users continually return to a specific search engine because they find the "biased" or "subjective" results to fit their needs.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Search neutrality has the possibility of causing search engines to become stagnant. If site A is first on a [[Search engine results page|SERP]] (search engine results page) one month, and then tenth the next month search neutrality advocates cry "foul play," but in reality it is often the page's loss in popularity, relevance, or quality content that has caused the move. The case against Google brought forth by the owners of Foundem extoll this phenomenon and regulation could limit the search engine's ability to adjust ranking based on their own metrics.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Proponents of search neutrality desire transparency in a search engine's ranking algorithm. Requiring transparent algorithms leads to two concerns. These algorithms are the companies private [[intellectual property]] and should not be forced into the open. This would be similar to forcing a soda manufacturer to publish their recipes. The second concern is that opening the algorithm would allow spammers to exploit and target how the algorithm functions directly. This would permit spammers to circumvent the metrics in place that prevent spammed websites from being at the top of a SERP.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Removing a search engine's ability to directly manipulate rankings limits their ability to penalize dishonest websites that practice [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] techniques to improve their rankings. Any site who finds a way to circumvent the algorithm would benefit from a search engine's inability to manually decrease their ranking causing a spam site to gain high ranking for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">In [[decision theory]], the '''sure-thing principle''' states that a decision maker who would take a certain action if he knew that event ''E'' has occurred, and also if he knew that the negation of ''E'' has occurred, should also take that same action if he knows nothing about ''E''.

The principle was coined by [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|L.J. Savage]]:&lt;ref&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954), ''The foundations of statistics''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=A businessman contemplates buying a certain piece of property. He considers the outcome of the next presidential election relevant. So, to clarify the matter to himself, he asks whether he would buy if he knew that the Democratic candidate were going to win, and decides that he would. Similarly, he considers whether he would buy if he knew that the Republican candidate were going to win, and again finds that he would. Seeing that he would buy in either event, he decides that he should buy, even though he does not know which event obtains, or will obtain, as we would ordinarily say. It is all  too seldom that a decision can be arrived at on the basis of this principle, but except possibly for the assumption of simple ordering, I know of no other extralogical principle governing decisions that finds such ready acceptance.|source=p. 21}}

He formulated the principle as a [[Strategic dominance|dominance principle]], but it can also be framed probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Jeffrey |jstor=192456 |title=The Sure Thing Principle |journal=Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association |volume=2 |year=1982 |pages=719-730}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeffrey&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt; and later Pearl&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Savage's principle is only valid when the probability of the event considered (e.g., the winner of the election) is unaffected by the action (buying the property). Under such conditions, the sure-thing principle is a theorem in the ''do''-calculus&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Bayes networks]]). Blyth&lt;ref name="blyth-72"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blyth|first1=C.|title=On Simpson's paradox and the sure-thing principle|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=1972|volume=67|pages=364–366|doi=10.2307/2284382}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed a counterexample to the sure-thing principle using sequential sampling in the context of [[Simpson's paradox]], but this example violates the required action-independence provision.&lt;ref name=pearl-2015-r466&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=The sure-thing principle|url=http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r466.pdf|website=UCLA Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Technical Report R-466|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is closely related to [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], and equivalent under the axiom of truth (everything the agent knows is true).&lt;ref&gt;Samet, Dov.  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~samet/papers/the-sure-thing-principle.pdf "The sure-thing principle and independence of irrelevant knowledge". Israel Institute of Business Research, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is similarly targeted by the [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg]] and [[Allais paradox|Allais paradoxes]], in which actual people's choices seem to violate this principle.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt;

[[File:Blank stop sign octagon.svg|thumb|upright|A red [[octagon]] symbolizes "stop" even without the word.|alt=Silhouette of a red octagon]]

A '''symbol''' is a mark, sign  or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is [[know]]n or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for "STOP". On a map, a blue line might represent a river. [[Numeral system|Numerals]] are symbols for [[number]]s. [[Alphabet]]ic letters may be symbols for sounds. Personal names are symbols representing individuals. A red rose may symbolize love and compassion. The [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.

In [[cartography]], an organized collection of symbols forms a [[Legend (map)#Map symbology|legend]] for a map.

==Etymology==
The word ''symbol'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σύμβολον ''symbolon'', meaning "token,  watchword" from σύν ''syn'' "together" and βάλλω ''bállō'' " "I throw, put." The sense evolution in Greek is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" was first recorded in 1590, in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=symbol&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In considering the effect of a symbol on the psyche, in his seminal essay ''The Symbol without Meaning'' [[Joseph Campbell]] proposes the following definition:
''A symbol is an energy evoking, and directing, agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|title=Flight of the Wild Gander:- The Symbol without Meaning|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|location=California|isbn=1-57731-210-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, expanding on what he means by this definition Campbell says:

:"a symbol, like everything else, shows a double aspect. We must distinguish, therefore between the 'sense' and the 'meaning' of the symbol. It seems to me perfectly clear that all the great and little symbolical systems of the past functioned simultaneously on three levels: the corporeal of waking consciousness, the spiritual of dream, and the ineffable of the absolutely unknowable. The term 'meaning' can refer only to the first two but these, today, are in the charge of science – which is the province as we have said, not of symbols but of signs. The ineffable, the absolutely unknowable, can be only sensed. It is the province of art which is not 'expression' merely, or even primarily, but a quest for, and formulation of, experience evoking, energy-waking images: yielding what [[Sir Herbert Read]] has aptly termed a 'sensuous apprehension of being'.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Symbol without Meaning p153''&lt;/ref&gt;
Jared Elisha defined symbolism that is something that stands for another, it can be place, object, or a person

[[Heinrich Zimmer]] gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols.

:"Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Heinrich Zimmer; edited by Joseph|title=Philosophies of India|year=1969|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-01758-1|pages=1–2|edition=9. paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Signs and Symbols, ''it is stated that ''A symbol ... is a visual image or sign representing an idea -- a deeper indicator of a universal truth.''&lt;ref&gt;Dorling Kindersley Limited. Signs and Symbols. p.6. {{ISBN|978-0-7566-3393-6}}. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbols are a means of complex communication that often can have multiple levels of meaning.&lt;ref name= "Womack"&gt;Womack, Mari. Symbols and Meaning: A Concise Introduction. California: AltaMira Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This separates symbols from [[sign]]s, as signs have only one meaning.

Human cultures use symbols to express specific ideologies and social structures and to represent aspects of their specific culture.  Thus, symbols carry meanings that depend upon one’s cultural background; in other words, the meaning of a symbol is not inherent in the symbol itself but is culturally learned.&lt;ref name="Womack" /&gt;

Symbols are the basis of all human understanding and serve as vehicles of conception for all human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Susanne K.  A Theory of Art, Developed From: Philosophy in a New Key. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols facilitate understanding of the world in which we live, thus serving as the grounds upon which we make judgments.&lt;ref name="Catherine"&gt;Palczewski, Catherine, and Ice, Richard, and Fritch, John. Rhetoric in Civic Life. Pennsylvania: Strata Publishing, Inc., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, people use symbols not only to make sense of the world around them, but also to [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] and cooperate in society through [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Symbols and semiotics==

[[Semiotics]] is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues.  Semiotics is linked with both [[linguistics]] and psychology.  Semioticians thus not only study what a symbol implies, but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society.  Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both [[denotation]] and [[connotation]].

==Psychoanalysis, rhetoric and archetypes==
Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], who studied [[archetype]]s, proposed an alternative definition of symbol, distinguishing it from the term ''[[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]''. In Jung's view, a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted this with ''symbol'', which he used to stand for something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise.  An example of a symbol in this sense is [[Christ]] as a symbol of the [[archetype]] called ''[[Self in Jungian psychology|self]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christ, A symbol of the self CW vol 9i Aion RKP 1958&lt;/ref&gt; For example, written languages are composed of a variety of different symbols that create words, p. . Through these written words humans communicate with each other. [[Kenneth Burke]] described ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a "[[Definition of man|symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal]]" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling. But the man's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of "blubber" representing something inedible in his mind. In addition, the symbol of "blubber" was created by the man through various kinds of [[learning]].

Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the [[The Interpretation of Dreams|theory of dreams]] but also to "normal symbol systems". He says they'''{{clarify|date=December 2013}}'''&lt;!--What is "they"?--&gt; are related through "substitution", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--The meaning of what?--&gt;. In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--This is still not clear.  These last two sentences do not clearly support or explain the one before it--&gt;.

[[Jean Dalby Clift]] says that people not only add their own interpretations to symbols, they also create personal symbols that represent their own understanding of their lives: what she calls "core images" of the person.  She argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Dalby Clift, ''Core Images of the Self: A Symbolic Approach to Healing and Wholeness''.  Crossroad, 1992. {{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfil psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as "the hero," "the princess" and "the witch" have remained popular for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130629202403/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6039-7 Indick, William. Ancient Symbology in Fantasy Literature: A Psychological Study. Jefferson: McFarland &amp;, 2012. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paul Tillich==

[[Paul Tillich]] argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities.  For Tillich a symbol always "points beyond itself" to something that is unquantifiable and mysterious; symbols open up the "depth dimension of reality itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol.
When a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the "symbol is taken for reality." The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality which are otherwise inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of context in symbolism==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
A symbol's [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] may be modified by various factors including popular usage, [[history]], and contextual [[intent (law)|intent]].

===Historical meaning===
The history of a symbol is one of many factors in determining a particular symbol's apparent meaning. Consequently, symbols with emotive power carry problems analogous to [[false etymologies]].

===Context===
The context of a symbol may change its meaning.  Similar five-pointed stars might signify a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officer or a member of the [[armed services]], depending upon the [[uniform]].

== Symbols in Cartography ==
[[File:Cartographic Symbols.jpg|thumb|The three categories of cartographic symbol shapes.]]
Symbols are used in cartography to communicate geographical information (generally as point, line, or area features).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles of map design |last=Tyner |first=Judith A. |date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=9781606235447 |location=New York |oclc=437300476}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other symbols, visual variables such as size, shape, orientation, texture, and pattern provide meaning to the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cartography : thematic map design |last=Dent |first=Borden D. |last2=Torguson |first2=Jeffrey |last3=Hodler |first3=T. W. |isbn=0072943823 |edition=6th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |oclc=184827987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form, or shape, of a cartographic symbol is classified into one of three main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=How maps work : representation, visualization, and design |last=MacEachren |first=Alan M. |date=1995 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=0898625890 |location=New York |oclc=31078855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial/Representational''' - a shape or image that clearly resembles the geographic feature being symbolized and can be interpreted without a legend.

'''Associative''' - a mixture of pictorial and geometric elements that produce an easily recognizable shape.

'''Abstract/Geometric''' - completely arbitrary shapes chosen to represent a certain feature.

==Symbolic action==
A '''symbolic action''' is an action that has no, or little, practical effect but symbolizes, or signals, what the actor wants or believes.  The action conveys meaning to the viewers.

Symbolic action may overlap with [[symbolic speech]], such as the use of [[flag burning]] to express hostility or saluting the flag to express patriotism.&lt;ref name="Bagossy2008"&gt;Bagossy, Renate. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LyziXxw238C&amp;pg=PA16 The Difficulty of the Amendment Process of the Constitution of the United States of America and Freedom of Speech and its limits]''. GRIN Verlag; 2008-08-11 [cited 5 November 2012]. {{ISBN|9783640129546}}. p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to intense public criticism, businesses, organizations, and governments may take symbolic actions rather than, or in addition to, directly addressing the identified problems.&lt;ref name="Bednar2008"&gt;Bednar, Michael Kay. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Fyefq5LV8sC How Symbolic Action Affects the Media as a Governance Mechanism]''. ProQuest; 2008. {{ISBN|9780549738817}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic actions are sometimes derided as [[slacktivism]].
