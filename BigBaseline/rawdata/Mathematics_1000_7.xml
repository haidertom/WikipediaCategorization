      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2682">In [[mathematics]], the phrases '''arbitrarily large''', '''arbitrarily small''', and '''arbitrarily long''' are used in statements such as:

: "&amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for arbitrarily large ''x''."

which is shorthand for:

: "For every real number ''n'', &amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for some values of ''x'' greater than ''n''."

"Arbitrarily large" is not equivalent to "[[sufficiently large]]". For instance, while it is true that prime numbers can be arbitrarily large since there are an [[Euclid's theorem|infinite number]] of them, it is not true that all sufficiently large numbers are prime. "Arbitrarily large" does not mean "[[infinitely large]]" because although prime numbers can be arbitrarily large, an infinitely large prime does not exist since all prime numbers (as well as all other integers) are finite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xamuel.com/arbitrary-and-infinity/ Infinitely Large vs. Arbitratily Large.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222215520/http://www.xamuel.com/arbitrary-and-infinity/ |date=2012-02-22 }} Accessed 21 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, phrases such as "P(''x'') is true for arbitrarily large ''x''" are used primarily for emphasis, as in "P(''x'') is true for all ''x'', no matter how large ''x'' is."  In these cases, the phrase "arbitrarily large" does not have the meaning indicated above but is in fact logically synonymous with "all."

To say that there are "arbitrarily long [[primes in arithmetic progressions|arithmetic progressions of prime numbers]]" does not mean that there exists any infinitely long arithmetic progression of prime numbers (there is not), nor that there exists any particular arithmetic progression of prime numbers that is in some sense "arbitrarily long", but rather that no matter how large a number ''n'' is, there exists some arithmetic progression of prime numbers of length at least ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/htdp2e-part2.html 4 Arbitrarily Large Data.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222213518/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/htdp2e-part2.html |date=February 22, 2012 }} Accessed 21 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement "&amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for arbitrarily large ''x''." could be rewritten as:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{, } \exists x \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{ such that } x &gt; n \land f(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

Using "sufficiently large" instead yields:

: &lt;math&gt;\exists n \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{ such that } \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{, } x &gt; n \Rightarrow f(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11243">"'''As I was going to St Ives'''" is a traditional English-language [[nursery rhyme]] in the form of a [[riddle]]. Its [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number is 19772.

==Lyrics==
The most common modern version is:

: As I was going to St. Ives,
: I met a man with seven wives,
: Each wife had seven sacks,
: Each sack had seven cats,
: Each cat had seven kits:
: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
: How many were there going to St. Ives?&lt;ref name=Opie1997&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 376–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The following version is found in a manuscript (Harley MS 7316) dating from approximately 1730:&lt;ref name="Opie1997"/&gt;  

: As I went to St. Ives
: I met Nine Wives
: And every  Wife had nine Sacs,
: And every Sac had nine Cats
: And every Cat had nine Kittens

A version very similar to that accepted today was published in the ''Weekly Magazine'' of August 4, 1779:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|work=The Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement

|date=1779-08-04

|volume=xlv

|page=132

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: As I was going to St Ives,
: Upon the road I met seven wives;
: Every wife had seven sacks,
: Every sack had seven cats,
: Every cat had seven kits:
: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
: How many were going to St Ives?

The suggestion of [[polygamy]] (implicit in the line "I met a man with seven wives") is generally absent from the earliest publications, but is present by 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Chambers' Edinburgh Journal |date=1837-04-29 |issue=274 |page=112 |title=A Hoax Extraordinary |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Chambers |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015035107351?urlappend=%3Bseq=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of places called [[St Ives (disambiguation)|St Ives]] in England and elsewhere. It is generally thought
that the rhyme refers to [[St Ives, Cornwall]], when it was a busy fishing port and had many cats to stop the rats and mice destroying the fishing gear, although some people argue it was [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire]] as this is an ancient [[market town]] and therefore an equally plausible destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Answers==

All potential answers to this riddle are based on its ambiguity because the riddle only tells us the group has been "met" on the journey to St. Ives and gives no further information about its intentions, only those of the narrator. In modern usage, 'to meet someone on the road' may include the sense of 'passed' or 'overtook'; while the older usage may have referred exclusively to those going in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Highway Code|page=9|publisher=The Stationery Office|date=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the 'correct' answer could be stated as "at least one, the narrator plus anyone who happens to be travelling in the same direction as him or her".&lt;ref name="legend of St Ives"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of St Yves|page=76|first=Bryan|last=Gibson|publisher=Waterside Press|date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the group that the narrator meets is assumed ''not'' to be travelling to St. Ives the answer could be ''one'' person going to St. Ives: the narrator. This is the most common assumption,&lt;ref name=Opie1997/&gt; as the purpose of the riddle was most likely to trick the listener into making long winded calculations only to be surprised by the simplicity of the answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Number Theory and Its History|page=118|first=Oystein|last=Ore|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|date=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one disregards the 'trick' answer and assumes the narrator overtook the group as they were ''also'' travelling to St. Ives,&lt;ref name=Opie1997/&gt; the most common mathematical answer is 2802: 1 man, 7 wives, 49 sacks, 343 cats, and 2401 kits, plus the narrator (the sum of a [[geometric series#Formula|geometric series]], plus one).

After the riddle was published in the August 4, 1779 issue of ''The Weekly Magazine'', as described above, a subsequent edition of that journal contained the following solution, submitted by reader "Philo-Rhithmus" of Edinburgh:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|work=The Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Why the deuce do you give yourselves so much vexation,
: And puzzle your brains with a long calculation
: Of the number of cats, with their kittens and sacks,
: Which ''went'' to St Ives, on the old women's backs,
: As you seem to suppose?  {{--}} Don't you see that the cunning
: Old Querist ''went only''? {{--}} The rest were all ''coming''.
: But grant the wives ''went'' too, {{--}} as sure's they were married,

: ''Eight'' only could go, {{--}} for the rest were all ''carried''.

A similar problem is found in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (Problem 79), dated to around 1650 BC.
The papyrus is translated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The problem appears to be an illustration of an [[algorithm]] for [[multiplication|multiplying]] numbers. The sequence 7, 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; appears in the right-hand column, and the terms 2,801, 2×2,801, 4×2,801 appear in the left; the sum on the left is 7×2,801 = 19,607, the same as the sum of the terms on the right. The equality of the two geometric sequences can be stated as the equation (2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(7&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) = 7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, which relies on the coincidence 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=7.

Note that the author of the papyrus listed a wrong value for the fourth power of 7; it should be 2,401, not 2,301. However, the sum of the powers (19,607) is correct.

The problem has been [[paraphrase]]d by modern commentators as a [[story problem]] involving houses, cats, mice, and grain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript EPISODE 17 – RHIND MATHEMATICAL PAPYRUS|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode17/|work=A history of the world|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus there is no discussion beyond the bare outline stated above. The [[ancient Egyptian weights and measures#Volume|hekat]] was {{frac|1|30}} of a cubic [[cubit]] (approximately {{convert|4.8|l|lk=on|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

| It was parodied by [[Roald Dahl]] in his poetry book ''[[Rhyme Stew]]'' (1989): "As I was going to St Ives/ I met a man with seven wives/ he said: "I think it's much more fun/ than getting stuck with only one."
| In the [[1995 in film|1995 film]] ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', the rhyme is presented to the protagonists by the villain as a riddle, giving them thirty seconds to telephone him on the number "555 plus the answer" or a bomb would detonate. The protagonists initially believe the answer to be 2401, only solving for the number of kits. However, they eventually solve the riddle, calling the number 555–0001 which proves to be correct. They missed the 30-second deadline, but the bomb did not explode since the villain had not said "[[Simon Says|Simon says]]."
| The rhyme was recited by [[Mary Murphy (actress)|Mary Murphy]]'s character while caring for a cat with seven kittens in the movie ''[[A Man Alone (film)|A Man Alone]]''. Later the character played by [[Ray Milland]] who overheard the rhyme offers her the answer and Murphy's character explains that she alone was going to St. Ives.
| The rhyme was also the basis of a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' Muppet skit from the show's first season, in which the boy Muppet holding a numeral 7 sings the rhyme as a song to the girl Muppet twice (the second time, the girl is busy writing down the calculations) and finally, in keeping true to the spirit of the riddle, reveals the answer as 1 (the traditional answer), because ''he'' was going to St. Ives and the kits, cats, sacks and wives were going the other way. Then the girl turns the tables on the boy and asks how many were going the other way.  She then reveals the mathematical answer from her calculations: 1 man + 7 wives + 49 sacks + 343 cats + 2,401 kittens, which comes to 2,801. Astonished, the boy responds, "How about that?!"
| ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine used it in at least two articles over the years for the following parodies:&lt;poem&gt;
As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
Of course, the seven wives weren't his
But here in France, that's how it is&lt;/poem&gt; and &lt;poem&gt;As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
I know this sounds absurd and loony
But that poor man was [[Mickey Rooney]]!&lt;/poem&gt;
| In a post-Christmas ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'' comic strip sequence from December 1957, Pogo Possum gives Albert Alligator a book with the poem and Albert immediately gets hopelessly entangled by the riddle. Pogo's proposed solution: "Gimme the book back an' I'll give you a pair of pants to go with the suspenders you got."
| In the sixth series of [[BBC]] radio comedy ''[[John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme]]'', the fourth episode features a sketch with a [[Cornishman]] arguing with another man on a train about whether he actually has seven wives, each of whom have sacks of cats with them, on the train with him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">The '''Cebeci–Smith model''' is a 0-equation [[eddy viscosity]] model used in [[computational fluid dynamics]] analysis of [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[boundary layer]] flows. The model gives eddy viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\mu_t&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of the local boundary layer velocity profile. The model is suitable for high-speed flows with thin attached boundary-layers, typically present in aerospace applications.  Like the [[Baldwin-Lomax model]], this model is not suitable for cases with large [[flow separation|separated]] regions and significant curvature/rotation effects.  Unlike the [[Baldwin-Lomax model]], this model requires the determination of a boundary layer edge.

The model was developed by [[Tuncer Cebeci]] and [[Apollo M. O. Smith]], in 1967.

== Equations ==

In a two-layer model, the boundary layer is considered to comprise two layers: inner (close to the surface) and outer. The eddy viscosity is calculated separately for each layer and combined using:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu_t =
\begin{cases}
{\mu_t}_\text{inner} &amp; \mbox{if } y \le y_\text{crossover} \\ 
{\mu_t}_\text{outer} &amp; \mbox{if } y &gt; y_\text{crossover}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_\text{crossover}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest distance from the surface where &lt;math&gt;{\mu_t}_\text{inner}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;{\mu_t}_\text{outer}&lt;/math&gt;.

The inner-region eddy viscosity is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mu_t}_\text{inner} = \rho \ell^2 \left[\left(
 \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right)^2 +
 \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\right)^2
\right]^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell = \kappa y \left( 1 - e^{-y^+/A^+} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

with the von Karman constant &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; usually being taken as 0.4, and with

:&lt;math&gt;
A^+ = 26\left[1+y\frac{dP/dx}{\rho u_\tau^2}\right]^{-1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The eddy viscosity in the outer region is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mu_t}_\text{outer} = \alpha \rho U_e \delta_v^* F_K
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.0168&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta_v^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement thickness]], given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_v^* = \int_0^\delta \left(1 - \frac{U}{U_e}\right)\,dy
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Klebanoff intermittency function given by

:&lt;math&gt;
F_K = \left[1 + 5.5 \left( \frac{y}{\delta} \right)^6
  \right]^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

The following tables list the [[computational complexity]] of various [[algorithm]]s for common [[mathematical operation]]s.

Here, complexity refers to the [[time complexity]] of performing computations on a [[multitape Turing machine]].&lt;ref name="Schonhage"&gt;A. Schönhage, A.F.W. Grotefeld, E. Vetter: ''Fast Algorithms—A Multitape Turing Machine Implementation'', BI Wissenschafts-Verlag, Mannheim, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; See [[big O notation]] for an explanation of the notation used.

Note: Due to the variety of multiplication algorithms, ''M''(''n'') below stands in for the complexity of the chosen multiplication algorithm.

==Special functions==
Many of the methods in this section are given in Borwein &amp; Borwein.&lt;ref&gt;J. Borwein &amp; P. Borwein. ''Pi and the AGM: A Study in Analytic Number Theory and Computational Complexity''. John Wiley 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elementary functions===
The [[elementary function]]s are constructed by composing arithmetic operations, the [[exponential function]] (exp), the [[natural logarithm]] (log), [[trigonometric function]]s (sin, cos), and their inverses. The complexity of an elementary function is equivalent to that of its inverse, since all elementary functions are [[analytic function|analytic]] and hence invertible by means of Newton's method. In particular, if either exp or log in the complex domain can be computed with some complexity, then that complexity is attainable for all other elementary functions.

Below, the size ''n'' refers to the number of digits of precision at which the function is to be evaluated.

The '''counting board''' is the precursor of the [[abacus]], and the earliest known form of a counting device (excluding fingers and other very simple methods). Counting boards were made of stone or wood, and the counting was done on the board with beads, or pebbles etc. Not many boards survive because of the perishable materials used in their construction. 

The oldest known counting board, the [[Salamis Tablet]] (''c.'' 300 BC) was discovered on the Greek island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ju.edu/ssundbe/salamis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103213141/http://users.ju.edu/ssundbe/salamis.html |archivedate=2008-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought to have been used by the Babylonians in about 300 BC and is more of a gaming board than a calculating device. It is marble, about 150 x 75 x 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and is in the [[Greek National museum]] in [[Athens]].  It has carved Greek letters and parallel grooves. 

The German mathematicican [[Adam Ries]] described the use of counting boards in ''Rechenbuch auf Linien und Ziphren in allerlei Handthierung / geschäfften und Kaufmanschafft''. In the novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', [[Hilary Mantel]] refers to [[Thomas Cromwell]] using a counting board in 16th-century England.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2906">In [[mathematics]], two objects, especially systems of axioms or semantics for them, are called '''cryptomorphic''' if they are equivalent but not obviously equivalent.  This word is a play on the many [[morphism]]s in mathematics, but "cryptomorphism" is only very distantly related to "[[isomorphism]]", "[[homomorphism]]", or "morphisms". The equivalence may possibly be in some informal sense, or may be formalized in terms of a [[bijection]] or [[equivalence of categories]] between the mathematical objects defined by the two cryptomorphic axiom systems.

==Etymology==

The word was coined by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] before 1967, for use in the third edition of his book ''Lattice Theory''.  Birkhoff did not give it a formal definition, though others working in the field have made some attempts since.

==Use in matroid theory==

Its informal sense was popularized (and greatly expanded in scope) by [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] in the context of [[matroid]] theory: there are dozens of equivalent axiomatic approaches to matroids, but two different systems of axioms often look very different.  

In his 1997 book ''Indiscrete Thoughts'', Rota describes the situation as follows:

{{cquote|Like many another great idea, matroid theory was invented by one of the great American pioneers, [[Hassler Whitney]].  His paper, which is still today the best entry to the subject, flagrantly reveals the unique peculiarity of this field, namely, the exceptional variety of cryptomorphic definitions for a matroid, embarrassingly unrelated to each other and exhibiting wholly different mathematical pedigrees.  It is as if one were to condense all trends of present day mathematics onto a single finite structure, a feat that anyone would ''a priori'' deem impossible, were it not for the fact that matroids do exist.}}

Though there are many cryptomorphic concepts in mathematics outside of matroid theory and [[universal algebra]], the word has not caught on among mathematicians generally.  It is, however, in fairly wide use among researchers in matroid theory.

Albany, NY: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3351-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a broad cluster of ideas ranging from distinct numerical and mathematical systems to multicultural mathematics education. The goal of ethnomathematics is to contribute both to the understanding of culture and the understanding of mathematics, and mainly to lead to an appreciation of the connections between the two.

==The development and meaning of "ethnomathematics"==
The term "ethnomathematics" was introduced by the Brazilian educator and mathematician [[Ubiratàn D'Ambrosio]] in 1977 during a presentation for the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].  Since D'Ambrosio put forth the term, people - D'Ambrosio included - have struggled with its meaning ("An etymological abuse leads me to use the words, respectively, ''ethno'' and ''mathema'' for their categories of analysis and ''tics'' from (from techne)".&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio 1997) D'Ambrosio. (1997). "Foreword", Ethnomathematics, p.xv and xx. {{ISBN|0-7914-3352-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The following is a sampling of some of the definitions of ethnomathematics proposed between 1985 and 2006:

*"The mathematics which is practiced among identifiable cultural groups such as national-tribe societies, labour groups, children of certain age brackets and professional classes".&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio, 1985)  D'Ambrosio. (1985). Ethnomathematics and its place in the history and pedagogy of mathematics. For the Learning of Mathematics, 5, 44-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The mathematics implicit in each practice".&lt;ref&gt;(Gerdes, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The study of mathematical ideas of a non-literate culture".&lt;ref&gt;(Ascher, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The codification which allows a cultural group to describe, manage and understand reality".&lt;ref&gt;(D.Ambrosio, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Mathematics…is conceived as a cultural product which has developed as a result of various activities".&lt;ref&gt;(Bishop, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The study and presentation of mathematical ideas of traditional peoples".&lt;ref&gt;(Ascher, 1991)  Ascher, Marcia (1991). Ethnomathematics: A Multicultural View of Mathematical Ideas. Pacific Grove, Calif.: Brooks/Cole. {{ISBN|0-412-98941-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Any form of cultural knowledge or social activity characteristic of a social group and/or cultural group that can be recognized by other groups such as Western anthropologists, but not necessarily by the group of origin, as mathematical knowledge or mathematical activity".&lt;ref&gt;(Pompeu, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The mathematics of cultural practice".&lt;ref&gt;(Presmeg, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The investigation of the traditions, practices and mathematical concepts of a subordinated social group".&lt;ref&gt;(Knijnik, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"I have been using the word ''ethnomathematics'' as modes, styles, and techniques (''tics'') of explanation, of understanding, and of coping with the natural and cultural environment (''mathema'') in distinct cultural systems (''ethnos'')".&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio, 1999, 146)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"What is the difference between ethnomathematics and the general practice of creating a mathematical model of a cultural phenomenon (e.g., the "mathematical anthropology" of Paul Kay [1971] and others)? The essential issue is the relation between intentionality and [[epistemology|epistemological]] status. A single drop of water issuing from a watering can, for example, can be modeled mathematically, but we would not attribute knowledge of that mathematics to the average gardener. Estimating the increase in seeds required for an increased garden plot, on the other hand, would qualify".&lt;ref&gt;(Eglash et al. 2006)  Eglash, R., Bennett, A., O'Donnell, C., Jennings, S., and Cintorino, M. "Culturally Situated Design Tools: Ethnocomputing from Field Site to Classroom." American Anthropologist, Vol. 108, No. 2. (2006), pp. 347–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==

===Numerals and naming systems===

====Numerals====

Some of the systems for representing numbers in previous and present cultures are well known. [[Roman numerals]] use a few letters of the alphabet to represent numbers up to the thousands, but are not intended for arbitrarily large numbers and can only represent positive [[integers]]. [[Arabic numerals]] are a family of systems, originating in India and passing to [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic civilization]], then to Europe, and now standard in global culture—and having undergone many curious changes with time and geography—can represent arbitrarily large numbers and have been adapted to negative numbers, [[fractions]], and [[real numbers]].

Less well known systems include some that are written and can be read today, such as the Hebrew and Greek method of using the letters of the [[alphabet]], in order, for digits 1–9, tens 10–90, and hundreds 100–900.

A completely different system is that of the [[quipu]], which recorded numbers on knotted strings.

Ethnomathematicians are interested in the ways in which numeration systems grew up, as well as their similarities and differences and the reasons for them.  The great variety in ways of representing numbers is especially intriguing.

====Names for numbers====

This means the ways in which number words are formed.&lt;ref&gt;(See Menninger (1934, 1969).) Menninger, Karl (1934), ''Zahlwort und Ziffer''. Revised edition (1958). Göttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht. (See Menninger (1934, 1969).) Menninger, Karl (1969), ''Number Words and Number Symbols''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky (1973) Zaslavsky, Claudia (1973). ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture''. Third revised ed., 1999. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books. {{ISBN|1-55652-350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====English=====
For instance, in English, there are four different systems. The units words (one to nine) and ten are special.  The next two are reduced forms of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] "one left over" and "two left over" (i.e., after counting to ten).  Multiples of ten from "twenty" to "ninety" are formed from the units words, one through nine, by a single pattern.  Thirteen to nineteen, and in a slightly different way twenty-one through ninety-nine (excluding the tens words), are compounded from tens and units words.  Larger numbers are also formed on a base of ten and its powers ("hundred" and "thousand").  One may suspect this is based on an ancient tradition of finger counting.  Residues of ancient counting by 20s and 12s are the words "score", "dozen", and "gross". (Larger number words like "million" are not part of the original English system; they are scholarly creations based ultimately on Latin.)

=====German=====
The German language counts similarly to English, but the unit is placed first in numbers over 20. For example, "26" is "sechsundzwanzig", literally "six and twenty". This system was formerly common in English, as seen in an artifact from the English [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Sing a Song of Sixpence]]": ''Sing a song of sixpence, / a pocket full of rye. / Four and twenty blackbirds, / baked in a pie.'' It persists in some children's songs such as "[https://guidezone.e-guiding.com/jmone_twenty.htm One and Twenty]."

=====French=====
In the French language as used in France, one sees some differences. ''Soixante-dix'' (literally, "sixty-ten") is used for "seventy". The words "quatre-vingt" (literally, "four-twenty", or 80) and "quatre-vingt-dix" (literally, "four-twenty ten" 90) are based on 20 ("vingt") instead of 10. [[Swiss French]] and [[Belgian French]] do not use these forms, preferring more standard [[Latin]]ate forms: ''septante'' for 70, ''octante'' for 80 and ''nonante'' for 90; In Swiss, they even replaced 80 with ''huitante'' (See the article [[:fr:80 (nombre)|80 (number) in French Wikipedia]]), which can date back to 12th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Bien écrire et parler juste, guide pratique d'expression et de communication |magazine=[[Reader's Digest|Sélection du Reader's Digest]] |page=21 |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |language=fr |first1=Yves |last1=Cormier |author-link=Yves Cormier |title=Dictionnaire du français acadien |editor=Fides |year=2009 |page=253 |isbn=978-2-7621-3010-2 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mesopotamia=====
In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], the base for constructing numbers was 60, with 10 used as an intermediate base for numbers below 60.

=====West Africa=====
Many West African languages base their number words on a combination of 5 and 20, derived from thinking of a complete hand or a complete set of [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] comprising both fingers and toes. In fact, in some languages, the words for 5 and 20 refer to these body parts (e.g., a word for 20 that means "man complete"). The words for numbers below 20 are based on 5 and higher numbers combine the lower numbers with multiples and powers of 20.  Of course, this description of hundreds of languages is badly oversimplified; better information and references can be found in Zaslavsky (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia (1973). ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture''. Third revised ed., 1999. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books. {{ISBN|1-55652-350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finger counting====
{{Main|Finger counting}}
Many systems of [[finger counting]] have been, and still are, used in various parts of the world. Most are not as obvious as holding up a number of fingers. The position of fingers may be most important.&lt;ref&gt;(See Zaslavsky (1980) for some finger-counting gestures.)  Zaslavsky, Claudia (1980). ''Count On Your Fingers African Style''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell. Revised with new illustrations, New York: Black Butterfly Books. {{ISBN|0-86316-250-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One continuing use for finger counting is for people who speak different languages to communicate prices in the marketplace.

In contrast to finger counting, the [[Yuki people]] (indigenous Americans from Northern California) keep count by using the four spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as an [[octal]] (base-8) counting system.

===The history of mathematics===

This area of ethnomathematics mainly focuses on addressing [[Eurocentrism]] by countering the common belief{{according to whom|date=September 2014}} that most worthwhile{{clarify|date=September 2014}} mathematics known and used today was developed in the Western world.&lt;!--the Greeks attributed mathematics to the Babylonians, the medieval Christians to the Arabs/Persians. So, up to the medieval period, "Western" contribution is rather underemphasized than overemphasized. For *modern* mathematics otoh it is of course true that it was mostly developed in the West, in the 18th to 19th centuries. So if you want to discuss "worthwhile" mathematics, please make clear if this is about historical, medieval mathematics, or about modern mathematics.--&gt;
 
The area stresses that "the history of mathematics has been oversimplified",{{according to whom|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--every field of knowledge has been 'oversimplified' by *somebody* (e.g. in journalism). Explain how this is somehow peculiar to the field of the history of mathematics more than of any other field--&gt;
and seeks to explore the emergence of mathematics from various ages and civilizations throughout human history.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Some examples and major contributors====

D'Ambrosio's 1980 review of the evolution of mathematics, his 1985 appeal to include ethnomathematics in the history of mathematics and his 2002 paper about the historiographical approaches to non-Western mathematics are excellent examples. Additionally, Frankenstein and Powell's 1989 attempt to redefine mathematics from a non-eurocentric viewpoint and Anderson's 1990 concepts of world mathematics are strong contributions to this area. Detailed examinations of the history of the mathematical developments of non-European civilizations, such as the [[Japanese mathematics|mathematics of ancient Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;(Shigeru, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;(Robson, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;(Ritter, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and of Islamic,&lt;ref&gt;(Sesiano, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;(Langermann and Simonson, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and Incan&lt;ref&gt;(Gilsdorf, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; civilizations, have also been presented.

===The philosophy and cultural nature of mathematics===

The core of any debate about the cultural nature of mathematics will ultimately lead to an examination of the nature of mathematics itself. One of the oldest and most controversial topics in this area is whether mathematics is internal or external, tracing back to the arguments of Plato, an externalist, and Aristotle, an internalist. On the one hand, Internalists such as Bishop, Stigler and Baranes, believe mathematics to be a cultural product. On the other hand, externalists, like Barrow, Chevallard and Penrose, see mathematics as culture-free, and tend to be major critics of ethnomathematics. With disputes about the nature of mathematics, come questions about the nature of ethnomathematics, and the question of whether ethnomathematics is part of mathematics or not. Barton, who has offered the core of research about ethnomathematics and philosophy, asks whether "ethnomathematics is a precursor, parallel body of knowledge or precolonized body of knowledge" to mathematics and if it is even possible for us to identify all types of mathematics based on a Western-epistemological foundation.&lt;ref&gt;(Barton, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political math===
{{Further|Anti-racist mathematics}}
The contributions in this area try to illuminate how mathematics has affected the nonacademic areas of society. One of the most controversial and provocative political components of ethnomathematics is its racial implications. Ethnomathematicians purport that the prefix "ethno" should not be taken as relating to race, but rather, the cultural traditions of groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;(D'Ambrosio. (1985). "Ethnomathematics and its place in the history and pedagogy of mathematics". ''For the Learning of Mathematics'', 5, 44-8., 1987; Borba, 1990; Skovsmose and Vithal, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in places like South Africa concepts of culture, ethnicity and race are not only intertwined but carry strong, divisive negative connotations. So, although it may be made explicit that ethnomathematics is not a "racist doctrine" it is vulnerable to association with racism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!-- Huh? This seems like [[:WP:OR]]. At the very least, a citation from a reliable source is needed. --&gt;

Another major facet of this area addresses the relationship between gender and mathematics. This looks at topics such as discrepancies between male and female math performance in educations and career-orientation, societal causes, women's contributions to mathematics research and development, etc.

====Some examples and major contributors====
Gerdes' writings about how mathematics can be used in the school systems of Mozambique and South Africa, and D'Ambrosio's 1990 discussion of the role mathematics plays in building a democratic and just society are examples of the impact mathematics can have on developing the identity of a society. In 1990, Bishop also writes about the powerful and dominating influence of Western mathematics. More specific examples of the political impact of mathematics are seen in Knijik's 1993 study of how Brazilian sugar cane farmers could be politically and economically armed with mathematics knowledge, and Osmond's analysis of an employer's perceived value of mathematics (2000).

===The mathematics of different cultures===

The focus of this area is to introduce the mathematical ideas of people who have generally been excluded from discussions of formal, academic mathematics. The research of the mathematics of these cultures indicates two, slightly contradictory viewpoints. The first supports the objectivity of mathematics and that it is something discovered not constructed. The studies reveal that all cultures have basic counting, sorting and deciphering methods, and that these have arisen independently in different places around the world. This can be used to argue that these mathematical concepts are being discovered rather than created. However, others emphasize that the usefulness of mathematics is what tends to conceal its cultural constructs. Naturally, it is not surprising that extremely practical concepts such as numbers and counting have arisen in all cultures. The universality of these concepts, however, seems harder to sustain as more and more research reveals practices which are typically mathematical, such as counting, ordering, sorting, measuring and weighing, done in radically different ways (see Section 2.1: Numerals and Naming Systems).

One of the challenges faced by researchers in this area is the fact that they are limited by their own mathematical and cultural frameworks. The discussions of the mathematical ideas of other cultures recast these into a Western framework in order to identify and understand them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} This raises the questions of how many mathematical ideas evade notice simply because they lack similar Western mathematical counterparts, and of how to draw the line classifying mathematical from non-mathematical ideas.

====Some examples and major contributors====
The majority of research in this area has been about the intuitive mathematical thinking of small-scale, traditional, indigenous cultures including: Aboriginal Australians,&lt;ref&gt;(Harris,1991)&lt;/ref&gt; the indigenous people of Liberia,&lt;ref&gt;(Gay and Cole, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans in North America,&lt;ref&gt;(Pixten,1987 and Ascher, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific Islanders,&lt;ref&gt;(Kyselka, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian construction foremen,&lt;ref&gt;(Carraher, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and tribes in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;(Zaslavsky, 1973) Zaslavsky, Claudia (1973). ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture''. Third revised ed., 1999. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books. {{ISBN|1-55652-350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Gerdes, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Games of skill====

An enormous variety of games that can be analyzed mathematically have been played around the world and through history. The interest of the ethnomathematician usually centers on the ways in which the game represents informal mathematical thought as part of ordinary society, but sometimes has extended to mathematical analyses of games. It does not include the careful analysis of good play&amp;mdash;but it may include the social or mathematical aspects of such analysis.

A mathematical game that is well known in European culture is [[tic-tac-toe]] (noughts-and-crosses). This is a geometrical game played on a 3-by-3 square; the goal is to form a straight line of three of the same symbol. There are many broadly similar games from all parts of England, to name only one country where they are found.

Another kind of geometrical game involves objects that move or jump over each other within a specific shape (a "board"). There may be captures. The goal may be to eliminate the opponent's pieces, or simply to form a certain configuration, e.g., to arrange the objects according to a rule. One such game is [[Nine Men's Morris]]; it has innumerable relatives where the board or setup or moves may vary, sometimes drastically. This kind of game is well suited to play out of doors with stones on the dirt, though now it may use plastic pieces on a paper or wooden board.

A mathematical game found in West Africa is to draw a certain figure by a line that never ends until it closes the figure by reaching the starting point (in mathematical terminology, this is a [[Eulerian path]] on a [[graph theory|graph]]). Children use sticks to draw these in the dirt or sand, and of course the game can be played with pen and paper.

The games of [[checkers]], [[chess]], [[oware]] (and other [[mancala]] games), and [[Go (board game)|Go]] may also be viewed as subjects for ethnomathematics.

====Mathematics in folk art====

One way mathematics appears in art is through [[symmetry|symmetries]]. Woven designs in cloth or carpets (to name two) commonly have some kind of symmetrical arrangement. A rectangular carpet often has [[rectangular symmetry]] in the overall pattern. A woven cloth may exhibit one of the seventeen kinds of [[plane symmetry groups]]; see Crowe (2004) for an illustrated mathematical study of African weaving patterns. Several types of patterns discovered by ethnomathematical communities are related to technologies; see Berczi (2002) about illustrated mathematical study of patterns and symmetry in Eurasia. Following the analysis of Indonesian folk weaving patterns&lt;ref&gt;Situngkir, H: ''[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1508/1508.02868.pdf Cellular-Automata and Innovation within Indonesian Traditional Weaving Crafts]'', Computers and Society Technical Report'', November 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Batak]] traditional architectural ornaments,&lt;ref&gt;Situngkir, H: ''[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01140 Deconstructing Bataknese Gorga Computationally]'', Computational Geometry Technical Report'', October 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the geometry of Indonesian traditional motifs of [[batik]] is analyzed by [[Hokky Situngkir]] that eventually made a new genre of [[fractal]] batik designs as [[generative art]]; see Situngkir and Surya (2007) for implementations.

===Mathematics education===

Ethnomathematics and mathematics education addresses first, how cultural values can affect teaching, learning and curriculum, and second, how mathematics education can then affect the political and social dynamics of a culture. One of the stances taken by many educators is that it is crucial to acknowledge the cultural context of mathematics students by teaching culturally based mathematics that students can relate to. Can teaching math through cultural relevance and personal experiences help the learners know more about reality, culture, society and themselves? Robert (2006)

Another approach suggested by mathematics educators is exposing students to the mathematics of a variety of different cultural contexts, often referred to as multicultural math. This can be used both to increase the social awareness of students and offer alternative methods of approaching conventional mathematics operations, like multiplication.(Andrew, 2005)

====Examples====
Various mathematics educators have explored ways of bringing together culture and mathematics in the classroom, such as: Barber and Estrin (1995) and Bradley (1984) on Native American education, Gerdes (1988b and 2001) with suggestions for using African art and games, Malloy (1997) about African American students and Flores (1997), who developed instructional strategies for Hispanic students.

== Criticism ==
Some critics claim that [[mathematics education]] in some countries, including the United States, unduly emphasizes ethnomathematics in order to promote [[multiculturalism]] while spending too little time on core mathematical content, and that this often results in [[pseudoscience]] being taught. An example of this criticism is an article by [[Marianne M. Jennings]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne M. Jennings: ''[http://www.csmonitor.com/1996/0402/02182.html ′Rain Forest′ Algebra Course Teaches Everything But Algebra]'', [[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', April 2, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Richard Askey]], who accuses&lt;ref&gt;Richard Askey: [http://library.msri.org/books/Book36/files/askey.pdf ''The Third Mathematics Education Revolution''], published in ''Contemporary Issues in Mathematics Education'' (Press Syndicate, Cambridge, UK, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Focus on Algebra'', the same [[Addison-Wesley]] textbook criticized by Marianne M. Jennings, of teaching pseudoscience, claiming for [[South Sea island]]ers [[mysticism|mystic]] knowledge of [[astronomy]] more advanced than scientific knowledge.

The '''European Congress of Mathematics''' ('''ECM''') is an international congress of the [[mathematics]] community, held every four years.  Its objectives are "to present various new aspects of pure and applied mathematics to a wide audience, to be a forum for discussion of the relationship between mathematics and society in Europe, and to enhance cooperation among mathematicians from all European countries."

The Congress is held under the auspices of the [[European Mathematical Society]] (EMS), and was one of its earliest initiatives. The [[European_Mathematical_Society#Prizes|EMS Prizes]] are awarded at the beginning of the Congress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20136">[[File:Exponential.svg|thumb|300px|right|The graph illustrates how exponential growth (green) surpasses both linear (red) and cubic (blue) growth. {{legend|green|Exponential growth}} {{legend|blue|[[Polynomial|Cubic growth]]}} {{legend|red|[[Linear growth]]}}]]

'''Exponential growth''' is exhibited when the [[Rate (mathematics)#Of change|rate of change]]—the change per instant or unit of time—of the value of a mathematical function is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the function's current value, resulting in its value at any time being an [[exponential function]] of time, i.e., a function in which the time value is the exponent.
[[Exponential decay]] occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative.  In the case of a discrete [[Domain of a function|domain]] of definition with equal intervals, it is also called '''geometric growth''' or '''geometric decay''', the function values forming a [[geometric progression]].  In either exponential growth or exponential decay, the ratio of the rate of change of the quantity to its current size remains constant over time.

The formula for exponential growth of a variable ''x'' at the growth rate ''r'', as time ''t'' goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), is

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of ''x'' at time 0. This formula is transparent when the exponents are converted to multiplication.  For instance, with a starting value of 50 and a growth rate of {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 5% = 0.05}} per interval, the passage of one interval would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05}}; two intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05}}; and three intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05}}.  In this way, each increase in the exponent by a full interval can be seen to increase the previous total by another five percent.  (The order of multiplication does not change the result based on the [[associative property]] of multiplication.)

Since the time variable, which is the input to this function, occurs as the exponent, this is an [[exponential function]].  This contrasts with growth based on a [[power function]], where the time variable is the base value raised to a fixed exponent, such as cubic growth (or in general terms denoted as [[Growth_rate_(group_theory)|polynomial growth]]).

*'''[[Biology]]'''
** The number of [[microorganism]]s in a [[microbiological culture|culture]] will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted. Typically the first organism [[cell division|splits]] into two daughter organisms, who then each split to form four, who split to form eight, and so on. Because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate, it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state. However, cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism  and gene expression.&lt;ref name="SlavovBudnik2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slavov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Budnik|first2=Bogdan A.|last3=Schwab|first3=David|last4=Airoldi|authorlink4=Edoardo Airoldi|first4=Edoardo M.|last5=van Oudenaarden|first5=Alexander|title=Constant Growth Rate Can Be Supported by Decreasing Energy Flux and Increasing Aerobic Glycolysis|journal=Cell Reports|volume=7|issue=3|year=2014|pages=705–714|issn=2211-1247|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.057|pmid=24767987|pmc=4049626}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
** A virus (for example [[SARS]], or [[smallpox]]) typically will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial [[immunization]] is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people.
** [[World population|Human population]], if the number of births and deaths per person per year were to remain at current levels (but also see [[logistic growth]]). For example, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]], over the last 100 years (1910 to 2010), the population of the United States of America is exponentially increasing at an average rate of one and a half percent a year (1.5%). This means that the [[doubling time]] of the American population (depending on the yearly growth in population) is approximately 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Census Data, "U.S. Census Bureau", 20 Dec 2012, Internet Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20121220035511/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Physics]]'''
** [[Avalanche breakdown]] within a [[dielectric]] material. A free [[electron]] becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied [[electrical field]] that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of the dielectric media. These ''secondary'' electrons also are accelerated, creating larger numbers of free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete [[dielectric breakdown]] of the material.
** [[Nuclear chain reaction]] (the concept behind [[nuclear reactors]] and [[nuclear weapons]]). Each [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] that undergoes [[Nuclear fission|fission]] produces multiple [[neutron]]s, each of which can be [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the [[probability]] of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[shape]] and [[mass]] of the uranium), ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. "Due to the exponential rate of increase, at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion, which only takes 3–4 generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq2.html|title=Introduction to Nuclear Weapon Physics and Design|publisher=Nuclear Weapons Archive|last=Sublette|first=Carey|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Positive feedback]] within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic [[Amplifier|amplification]] can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal, although [[resonance]] effects may favor some [[component frequencies]] of the signal over others.
* '''[[Economics]]'''
** [[Economic growth]] is expressed in percentage terms, implying exponential growth.
* '''[[Finance]]'''
** [[Compound interest]] at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital. See also [[rule of 72]].
** [[Pyramid scheme]]s or [[Ponzi scheme]]s also show this type of growth resulting in high profits for a few initial investors and losses among great numbers of investors.
* [[Computer|'''Computer technology''']]
** [[Clock rate|Processing power]] of computers. See also [[Moore's law]] and [[technological singularity]]. (Under exponential growth, there are no singularities. The singularity here is a metaphor, meant to convey an unimaginable future. The link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]].)
** In [[computational complexity theory]], computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) for only a constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, if a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 10}} requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 11}} requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 12}} will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of [[Moore's Law]] do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size ''x'' in time ''t'', then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size ''x'' + constant in the same time ''t''. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.

==Basic formula==
A quantity ''x'' depends exponentially on time ''t'' if

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''a'' is the initial value of ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;x(0)=a\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the constant ''b'' is a positive growth factor, and ''τ'' is the [[time constant]]—the time required for ''x'' to increase by one factor of ''b'':

:&lt;math&gt;x(t+\tau)=a \cdot b^{\frac{t+\tau}{\tau}} = a \cdot b^{\frac{t}{\tau}} \cdot b^{\frac{\tau}{\tau}} = x(t)\cdot b\, .&lt;/math&gt;

If {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, then ''x'' has exponential growth. If {{nowrap|''τ'' &lt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, or {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}}  and 0 &lt; {{nowrap|''b'' &lt; 1}}, then ''x'' has [[exponential decay]].

Example: ''If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?''  The question implies ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;min.

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}=1\cdot 2^{(60\text{ min})/(10\text{ min})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x(1\text{ hr})= 1 \cdot 2^6 =64.&lt;/math&gt;

After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.

Many pairs (''b'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') of a [[dimensionless]] non-negative number ''b'' and an amount of time ''τ'' (a [[physical quantity]] which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with ''τ'' proportional to log&amp;nbsp;''b''. For any fixed ''b'' not equal to 1 (e.g. ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time ''τ''. For any non-zero time ''τ'' the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number&amp;nbsp;''b''.

Thus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different [[exponentiation|base]].  The most common forms are the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_0\cdot e^{kt} = x_0\cdot e^{t/\tau} = x_0 \cdot 2^{t/T}
= x_0\cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^{t/p},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; expresses the initial quantity ''x''(0).

Parameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):
* The ''growth constant'' ''k'' is the [[frequency]] (number of times per unit time) of growing by a factor ''e''; in finance it is also called the logarithmic return,  [[continuous compounding|continuously compounded return]], or [[Compound interest#Force of interest|force of interest]].
* The ''[[e-folding|e-folding time]]'' ''τ'' is the time it takes to grow by a factor ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''.
* The ''[[doubling time]]'' ''T'' is the time it takes to double.
* The percent increase ''r'' (a dimensionless number) in a period ''p''.
The quantities ''k'', ''τ'', and ''T'', and for a given ''p'' also ''r'', have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{\ln 2}{T} = \frac{\ln \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' = 0 corresponds to ''r'' = 0 and to ''τ'' and ''T'' being infinite.

If ''p'' is the unit of time the quotient ''t''/''p'' is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation ''t'' for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, ''t''/''p'' can be replaced by ''t'', but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by ''p'' in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.

A popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the [[rule of 70]],
i.e. &lt;math&gt;T \simeq 70 / r&lt;/math&gt;.

{{wide image|doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg|640px|Graphs comparing doubling times and half lives of exponential growths (bold lines) and decay (faint lines), and their 70/''t'' and 72/''t'' approximations. In the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg SVG version], hover over a graph to highlight it and its complement.}}

==Reformulation as log-linear growth==
If a variable ''x'' exhibits exponential growth according to &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;, then the log (to any base) of ''x'' [[linear function|grows linearly]] over time, as can be seen by taking [[logarithm]]s of both sides of the exponential growth equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\log x(t) = \log x_0 + t \cdot \log (1+r).&lt;/math&gt;

This allows an exponentially growing variable to be modeled with a [[Nonlinear regression#Linearization|log-linear model]]. For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on ''x'', one can [[linear regression|linearly regress]] log ''x'' on ''t''.

==Differential equation==
The [[exponential function]] &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[linear differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\, \frac{dx}{dt} = kx&lt;/math&gt;

saying that the change per instant of time of ''x'' at time ''t'' is proportional to the value of ''x''(''t''), and ''x''(''t'') has the [[initial value]]
:&lt;math&gt;x(0).&lt;/math&gt;

The differential equation is solved by direct integration:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = kx \\[5pt]
\frac{dx} x &amp; = k\, dt \\[5pt]
\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \frac{dx}{x} &amp; = k \int_0^t  \, dt \\[5pt]
\ln \frac{x(t)}{x(0)} &amp; =  kt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) =  x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above differential equation, if {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; 0}}, then the quantity experiences [[exponential decay]].

For a [[nonlinear]] variation of this growth model see [[logistic function]].

==Difference equation==
The [[difference equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = a \cdot x_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;

has solution

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0 \cdot a^t,&lt;/math&gt;

showing that ''x'' experiences exponential growth.

== Other growth rates ==
In the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]]) as well as any [[polynomial]] growth, i.e., for all α:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} {t^\alpha \over ae^t} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See [[Degree of a polynomial#The degree computed from the function values]].

Growth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called [[hyperbolic growth]]. In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the [[hyperoperation]]s beginning at [[tetration]], and &lt;math&gt;A(n,n)&lt;/math&gt;, the diagonal of the [[Ackermann function]].

==Limitations of models==
Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic. Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored [[negative feedback]] factors become significant (leading to a [[logistic growth]] model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down.

==Exponential stories==

===Rice on a chessboard===
{{see also|Wheat and chessboard problem}}
According to an old legend, vizier Sissa Ben Dahir presented an Indian King Sharim with a beautiful, hand-made [[chessboard]]. The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third etc. The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought. All went well at first, but the requirement for 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; grains on the ''n''th square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square, more than a million million ({{aka}} [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares. (From Swirski, 2006)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=Jonathan|title=Capitalism: as if the world matters|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=1-84407-192-8|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[second half of the chessboard]] is the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization's overall business strategy.

===Water lily===
French children are told a story in which they imagine having a pond with [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]] leaves floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and, if left unchecked, it will smother the pond in thirty days killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day, the plant's growth is small and so it is decided that it shall be cut down when the water lilies cover half of the pond. The children are then asked on what day will half of the pond be covered in water lilies.  The solution is simple when one considers that the water lilies must double to completely cover the pond on the thirtieth day.  Therefore, the water lilies will cover half of the pond on the twenty-ninth day. There is only one day to save the pond. (From Meadows ''et al''. 1972)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005/&gt;

'''''Formulario Mathematico''''' ([[Latino sine flexione]]:&lt;ref&gt;While Latino sine Flexione was sometimes called Interlingua, it should not be confused with modern [[Interlingua]], developed between 1924 and 1951 by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Formulation of mathematics'') is a book&lt;ref&gt;
There are many editions. Here are two:
* (French) Published 1901 by Gauthier-Villars, Paris.  230p.  [https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15255022W/Formulaire_des_mathematiques OpenLibrary OL15255022W], [https://archive.org/details/formulairedesmat00pean PDF].
* (Italian) Published 1960 by Edizione cremonese, Roma. 463p.  [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL16587658M/Formulario_mathematico OpenLibrary OL16587658M].&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Giuseppe Peano]] which expresses fundamental theorems of mathematics in a symbolic language developed by Peano. The author was assisted by [[Giovanni Vailati]], [[Mario Pieri]], [[Alessandro Padoa]], [[Giovanni Vacca (mathematician)|Giovanni Vacca]], [[Vincenzo Vivanti]], [[Gino Fano]] and [[Cesare Burali-Forti]].

The ''Formulario'' was first published in 1895. The fifth and last edition was published in 1908. 

Kennedy&lt;ref name=HCK&gt;H.C. Kennedy (1980) ''Peano, Life and Works of Giuseppe Peano'', Chapter 6: The ''Formulario Project'', pages 44&amp;ndash;50, Chapter 17: Completion of the ''Formulario'', page 118&amp;ndash;24, [[D. Reidel]] {{ISBN|90-277-1067-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "the development and use of [[mathematical logic]] is the guiding motif of the project". He also explains the variety of Peano's publication under the title:
:the five editions of the ''Formulario'' [are not] editions in the usual sense of the word. Each is essentially a new elaboration, although much material is repeated. Moreover, the title and language varied: the first three, titled ''Formulaire de Mathématiques'', and the fourth, titled, ''Formulaire Mathématique'', were written in French, while [[Latino sine flexione]], Peano's own invention, was used for the fifth edition, titled ''Formulario Mathematico''. ... Ugo Cassina lists no less than twenty separately published items as being parts of the 'complete' ''Formulario''!&lt;ref name=HCK/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Peano believed that students needed only precise statement of their lessons. He wrote:
:Each professor will be able to adopt this ''Formulario'' as a [[textbook]], for it ought to contain all theorems and all methods. His teaching will be reduced to showing how to read the formulas, and to indicating to the students the theorems that he wishes to explain in his course.&lt;ref name=HCK/&gt;{{rp|66}}
Such a dismissal of the [[oral tradition]] in lectures at universities was the undoing of Peano's own teaching career.&lt;ref name=HCK/&gt;{{rp|chapter 14}}

'''Graph paper''', '''coordinate paper''', '''grid paper''', or '''squared paper''' is writing [[paper]] that is printed with fine lines making up a [[regular grid]]. The lines are often used as guides for plotting [[mathematical function]]s or [[experimental data]] and drawing [[two-dimensional graph]]s. It is commonly found in mathematics and engineering education settings and in [[laboratory notebook]]s. Graph paper is available either as [[loose leaf]] paper or bound in [[notebook]]s.

== History ==
The first commercially published "coordinate paper" is usually attributed to Dr. Buxton of England, who patented paper, printed with a rectangular coordinate grid, in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://web.calstatela.edu/curvebank/index/milestone.pdf |title=Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization |publisher=York University |first1=Michael |last1=Friendly |first2=Daniel J. |last2=Denis |page=13 |date=5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, E. H. Moore, a distinguished mathematician at the University of Chicago, advocated usage of paper with "squared lines" by students of high schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://micromath.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/graphed-paper/ |title=Graphed Paper |work=Mathematics under the Microscope |first=Alexandre |last=Borovik |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1906 edition of ''Algebra for Beginners'' by H. S. Hall and S. R. Knight included a strong statement that "the squared paper should be of good quality and accurately ruled to inches and tenths of an inch. Experience shows that anything on a smaller scale (such as 'millimeter' paper) is practically worthless in the hands of beginners."&lt;ref name="pballew-graph"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.pballew.net/arithme7.html#graphppr |chapter=Some Notes on graph paper |title=Math Words, and Some Other Words, of Interest |website=PBallew.net |first=Pat |last=Ballew |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "graph paper" did not catch on quickly in American usage. ''A School Arithmetic'' (1919) by H. S. Hall and F. H. Stevens had a chapter on graphing with "squared paper". ''Analytic Geometry'' (1937) by W. A. Wilson and J. A. Tracey used the phrase "coordinate paper". The term "squared paper" remained in British usage for longer; for example it was used in ''Public School Arithmetic'' (1961) by W. M. Baker and A. A. Bourne published in London.&lt;ref name="pballew-graph"/&gt;

== Formats ==
* '''Quad paper''', sometimes referred to as '''quadrille paper''' from French quadrillé, 'small square',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/quadrille#quadrille_Noun_300 |title=quadrille |encyclopedia=Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a common form of graph paper with a sparse grid printed in light blue or gray and right to the edge of the paper. In the U.S. and Canada, it often has two, four or five squares to the inch for work not needing too much detail. Metric paper with similarly sparse grid typically has one or two squares per centimeter.
* '''Engineering paper''', or an '''Engineer's Pad''',&lt;ref name="mit-pset"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/me-ugoffice/communication/pset-format.pdf |title=The Preparation of Engineering Problem Sets |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |agency=Technical Communications in Mechanical Engineering |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is traditionally printed on light green or tan translucent paper. It may have four, five or ten squares per inch. The grid lines are printed on the back side of each page and show through faintly to the front side.  Each page has an unprinted margin.  When [[Photocopier|photocopied]] or [[Image scanner|scanned]], the grid lines typically do not show up in the resulting copy, which often gives the work a neat, uncluttered appearance.  In the U.S. and Canada, some engineering professors require student [[homework]] to be completed on engineering paper.&lt;ref name="mit-pset"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.auburn.edu/cheweb/student/Homework_Format.pdf |title=Required Homework Format |agency=Department of Chemical Engineering |publisher=Auburn University |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Millimeter paper''' has ten squares per centimeter and is used for [[technical drawing]]s.
* '''Hexagonal paper''' shows regular hexagons instead of squares. These can be used to map geometric [[Tiling by regular polygons|tiled or tesselated]] designs among other uses.
* '''Isometric graph paper''' or '''3D graph paper''' is a triangular graph paper which uses a series of three guidelines forming a 60° grid of small triangles. The triangles are arranged in groups of six to make hexagons. The name suggests the use for [[isometric projection|isometric views]] or pseudo-three-dimensional views. Among other functions, they can be used in the design of [[trianglepoint]] [[embroidery]]. It can be used to draw angles accurately.
* '''Logarithmic paper''' has rectangles drawn in varying widths corresponding to [[logarithmic scale]]s for [[semi-log plot]]s or [[log-log plot]]s.
* '''Normal [[probability]] paper''' is another graph paper with rectangles of variable widths. It is designed so that "the graph of the normal distribution function is represented on it by a straight line", i.e. it can be used for a [[normal probability plot]].&lt;ref name="eom-prob"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Probability_graph_paper&amp;oldid=11790 |title=Probability graph paper |work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics |first=A. V. |last=Prokhorov |year=2011 |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Polar coordinate paper''' has concentric circles divided into small arcs or 'pie wedges' to allow plotting in [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]].

In general, graphs showing grids are sometimes called '''Cartesian''' graphs because the square can be used to map measurements onto a [[cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian (x vs. y)]] coordinate system. It is also available without lines but with dots at the positions where the lines would intersect.

== Model form ==

The general case is a [[non-linear system|non-linear model]] with a partial theoretical structure and some unknown parts derived from data. Models with unlike theoretical structures need to be evaluated individually,&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathworks13"&gt;Mathworks, 2013. [http://www.mathworks.com.au/help/ident/ug/supported-grey-box-models.html Supported grey box models ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauth08"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hauth |first=J. |year=2008|title=Grey Box Modelling for Nonlinear Systems| url=https://kluedo.ub.uni-kl.de/files/2045/diss.pdf | type= dissertation, [[Kaiserslautern University of Technology]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly using [[simulated annealing]] or [[genetic algorithms]].

Within a particular model structure, [[System identification|parameters]]&lt;ref name="Hauth08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash87" &gt;Nash, J.C. and Walker-Smith, M. 1987.

Queensland Branch, Brisbane), 129-148.&lt;/ref&gt; may need to be found. For a particular structure it is arbitrarily assumed that the data consists of sets of feed vectors '''f''', product vectors '''p''', and operating condition vectors '''c'''.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;  Typically '''c''' will contain values extracted from '''f''', as well as other values. In many cases a model can be converted to a function of the form:&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"&gt;Whiten, W.J., 1994.

: '''m(f,p,q)'''
where the vector function '''m''' gives the errors between the data '''p''', and the model predictions. The vector '''q''' gives some variable parameters that are the model's unknown parts.

The parameters '''q''' vary with the operating conditions '''c''' in a manner to be determined.&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; This relation can be specified as '''q''' = '''Ac''' where '''A''' is a matrix of unknown coefficients, and '''c''' as in [[linear regression]]&lt;ref name="Draper98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisburg05"/&gt; includes a constant term and possibly transformed values of the original operating conditions to obtain non-linear relations&lt;ref name="Wikipolynomial"&gt;[[Polynomial]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wikispline"&gt;[[Spline (mathematics)]]&lt;/ref&gt; between the original operating conditions and '''q'''. It is then a matter of selecting which terms in '''A''' are non-zero and assigning their values. The model completion becomes an [[Mathematical optimization|optimisation]] problem to determine the non-zero values in '''A''' that minimizes the error terms '''m(f,p,Ac)''' over the data.&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" &gt;Kojovic, T., and Whiten W. J., 1994.

== Model completion ==

Once a selection of non-zero values is made, the remaining coefficients in '''A''' can be determined by minimizing '''''m''(''f'',''p'',''Ac'')''' over the data with respect to the nonzero values in '''A''', typically by [[non-linear least squares]]. Selection of the nonzero terms can be done by optimization methods such as [[simulated annealing]] and [[evolutionary algorithms]]. Also the [[non-linear least squares]] can provide accuracy estimates&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash87" /&gt; for the elements of '''A''' that can be used to determine if they are significantly different from zero, thus providing a method of [[Model selection|term selection]].&lt;ref name="Linhart86"&gt;{{cite book|first=H. |last=Linhart|first2=W. |last2=Zucchini|title=Model selection|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=fzDm34Z8ctUC}}|year=1986|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-83722-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan |last=Miller|title=Subset Selection in Regression|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V-vLBQAAQBAJ}}|date=15 April 2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes possible to calculate values of '''q''' for each data set, directly or by [[non-linear least squares]]. Then the more efficient [[linear regression]] can be used to predict '''q''' using '''c'''  thus selecting the non-zero values in '''A''' and estimating their values. Once the non-zero values are located [[non-linear least squares]] can be used on the original model '''m(f,p,Ac)''' to refine these values .&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt;

A third method is [[model inversion]],&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt; which converts the non-linear '''m'''('''f''','''p''','''Ac''') into an approximate linear form in the elements of '''A''', that can be examined using efficient term selection&lt;ref name="Linhart86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"/&gt; and evaluation of the linear regression.&lt;ref name="Lawson96"/&gt;  For the simple case of a single '''q''' value ('''q''' = '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c''') and an estimate '''q*''' of '''q'''. Putting d'''q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c'''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''q*''' gives

: '''m(f,p,a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c) = m(f,p,q* + '''d'''q) ≈ m(f,p.q*) + '''d'''q m’(f,p,q*) = m(f,p.q*) + (a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c − q*) m’(f,p,q*)'''

so that '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is now in a linear position with all other terms known, and thus can be analyzed by [[linear regression]] techniques. For more than one parameter the method extends in a direct manner.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; After checking that the model has been improved this process can be repeated until convergence. This approach has the advantages that it does not need the parameters '''q''' to be able to be determined from an individual data set and the linear regression is on the original error terms&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;

== Model validation ==

Where sufficient data is available, division of the data into a separate model construction set and one or two [[Cross-validation (statistics)|evaluation sets]] is recommended. This can be repeated using multiple selections of the construction set and the [[Bootstrap aggregating|resulting models averaged]] or used to evaluate prediction differences.

A statistical test such as [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]] on the residuals is not particularly useful.&lt;ref name="Deming2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=William Edwards | last = Deming|title=Out of the Crisis p272|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LA15eDlOPgoC |page=272}}|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54115-2| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chi squared test requires known standard deviations which are seldom available, and failed tests give no indication of how to improve the model&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;

An attempt to predict the residuals '''m(, )''' with the operating conditions '''c''' using linear regression will show if the residuals can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt; Residuals that cannot be predicted offer little prospect of improving the model using the current operating conditions.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Terms that do predict the residuals are prospective terms to incorporate into the model to improve its performance.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;

The model inversion technique above can be used as a method of determining whether a model can be improved. In this case selection of nonzero terms is not so important and linear prediction can be done using the significant [[eigenvectors]] of the [[Design matrix|regression matrix]]. The values in '''A''' determined in this manner need to be substituted into the nonlinear model to assess improvements in the model errors. The absence of a significant improvement indicates the available data is not able to improve the current model form using the defined parameters.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Extra parameters can be inserted into the model to make this test more comprehensive.

The '''hat operator''' is a [[mathematical notation]] with various uses in different branches of science and [[mathematics]].

==Hat matrix==
{{Main|hat matrix}}
In statistics, the hat matrix ''H'' projects the observed values '''y''' of response variable to the predicted values '''ŷ''': 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{y}} = H \mathbf{y}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Cross product==
In [[screw theory]], one use of the [[circumflex|hat]] operator is to represent the [[cross product]] operation.  Since the cross product is a [[linear transformation]], it can be represented as a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  The hat operator takes a [[coordinate vector|vector]] and transforms it into its equivalent matrix.  

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{\hat{a}} \mathbf{b} &lt;/math&gt;

For example, in three dimensions,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} a_x \\ a_y \\ a_z \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} b_x \\ b_y \\ b_z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -a_z &amp; a_y \\ a_z &amp; 0 &amp; -a_x \\ -a_y &amp; a_x &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} b_x \\ b_y \\ b_z \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{\hat{a}} \mathbf{b}  &lt;/math&gt;

==Unit vector==
{{Main|unit vector}}

==Estimated value==
In [[statistics]], the hat is used to denote an [[estimator]] or an estimated value, as opposed to its theoretical counterpart. For example, in the context of [[Errors and residuals in statistics|errors and residuals]], the "hat" over the letter ε indicates an observable estimate (the residuals) of an unobservable quantity called ε (the statistical errors).

==Biography==
Born March 30, 1876 to a [[New Jersey]] insurance claims adjuster and a housewife, and raised in [[Massachusetts]], her family tree included colonial settlers. Young Helen's formal education started at a high school in Massachusetts, and after graduating she went to [[Wellesley College]], where she intended to major in Greek and Latin. Unusually, the mathematics faculty at the college consisted mostly of women, including [[Ellen Hayes]], and before completing her first years, Helen Merrill had decided to major in mathematics instead of languages. In 1893 she began teaching at Wellesley while also studying and guest lecturing abroad. In 1903 she earned a PhD in mathematics at Yale under the direction of [[James Pierpont (mathematician)|James Pierpont]]. In 1920 she was appointed vice-president of the [[Mathematical Association of America]]. Upon her retirement from Wellesley, she was given the title [[Professor Emerita]].

At Wellesley, Merrill wrote two textbooks with [[Clara Eliza Smith]], ''Selected Topics in Higher Algebra'' (Norwood, 1914) and ''A First Course in Higher Algebra'' (Macmillan, 1917).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/smith.htm|title=Clara Eliza Smith|work=Biographies of Women Mathematicians|first=Larry|last=Riddle|publisher=Agnes Scott College|date=February 25, 2016|accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reviews of ''A First Course in Higher Algebra'':

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12783">{{Redirect|Predicativism|the other school of philosophy, also known as predicativism|Ultrafinitism}}
Something that is '''impredicative''', in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], is a [[self reference|self-referencing]] [[definition]]. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.

The opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratified]] (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is [[intuitionistic type theory]], which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.

[[Russell's paradox]] is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The [[paradox]] is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be  asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.

The [[greatest lower bound]] of a set {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|glb({{var|X}})}}, also has an impredicative definition: {{math|1={{var|y}} = glb({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and any {{math|{{var|z}}}} less than or equal to all elements of {{math|{{var|X}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|y}}}}. This definition quantifies over the set (potentially [[infinite set|infinite]], depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, one of which being the glb itself. Hence '''predicativism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would reject this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

|source={{harv|Russell|1907|loc=p.34}} (Russell used "norm" to mean a proposition: roughly something that can take the values "true" or "false".)
}}

The terms "predicative" and "impredicative" were introduced by {{harvtxt|Russell|1907}}, though the meaning has changed a little since then. 

[[Solomon Feferman]] provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vicious circle principle]] was suggested by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905-6, 1908)&lt;ref&gt;dates derived from Kleene 1952:42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called ''impredicative''.

The first modern paradox appeared with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]]'s 1897 ''A question on transfinite numbers''&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) ''A question on transfinite numbers'' in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) ''Letter to Dedekind'' in van Heijenoort 1967:113&lt;/ref&gt; and would become known as the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) "naive" set theory and this become known as [[Cantor's paradox]]. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's ''Lettern to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; with his reading of [[Frege]]'s treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:
{{quote|On the other hand, it may be also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' in van Heijenoort 1967:23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, given {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} the function {{math|{{var|f}}}} is the variable and {{math|{{var|a}}}} is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} for {{math|{{var|f}}}} itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:
{{quote|You state ... that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let {{math|{{var|w}}}} be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can {{math|{{var|w}}}} be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. There we must conclude that {{math|{{var|w}}}} is not a predicate. Likewise, there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell's 1902 ''Letter to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124-125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:
{{quote|Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that "The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in ''The principles of mathematics'' (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...".&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by "propounding his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a ''predicative'' function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments".&lt;ref&gt;Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;/ref&gt; But this "axiom" was met with resistance from all quarters.

The rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the [[natural number]]s as classically understood) leads to the position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as predicativism, advocated by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in his ''Das Kontinuum''. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.

[[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 "A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering"{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}} presents an entire section "b. ''Objection concerning nonpredicative definition''" where he argued against "Poincaré (1906, p.&amp;nbsp;307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt; He gives two examples of impredicative definitions &amp;ndash; (i) the notion of [[Dedekind chain]]s and (ii) "in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers {{math|{{var|Z}}}} is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190–191&lt;/ref&gt; He ends his section with the following observation: "A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:191&lt;/ref&gt;

Zermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of [[Least upper bound]] in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 ''Das Kontinuum'' (''The Continuum'') to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the "theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set {{math|M}} of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] argued that "impredicative" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of "tallest person in the room" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: {{math|1={{var|y}} = min({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and {{math|{{var|y}}}} is in {{math|{{var|X}}}}.

Burgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of [[Frege]]'s logic, [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second order arithmetic]], and [[axiomatic set theory]].

He states that his 6 or so (famous) examples of paradoxes (antinomies) are all examples of impredicative definition, and says that Poincaré (1905–6, 1908) and Russell (1906, 1910) "enunciated the cause of the paradoxes to lie in these impredicative definitions" (p.&amp;nbsp;42), however, "parts of mathematics we want to retain, particularly analysis, also contain impredicative definitions." (ibid). Weyl in his 1918 ("Das Kontinuum") attempted to derive as much of analysis as was possible without the use of impredicative definitions, "but not the theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set M of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (CF. also Weyl 1919)" (p.&amp;nbsp;43).

He claims to show methods for eliminating the "paradoxes of syntax" ("logical paradoxes") — by use of the theory of types — and  "the paradoxes of semantics" — by the use of metalanguage (his "theory of levels of language"). He attributes the suggestion of this notion to Russell and more concretely to Ramsey.

'''Lagrange stability''' is a concept in the [[stability theory]] of [[dynamical systems]], named after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]].

For any point in the state space, &lt;math&gt;x \in M &lt;/math&gt; in a real continuous [[Dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]] &lt;math&gt;(T,M,\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, the '''motion''' &lt;math&gt;\Phi(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''positively Lagrange stable'' if the [[Orbit (dynamics)|positive semi-orbit]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma_x^+&lt;/math&gt; is [[compact set|compact]]. If the [[Orbit (dynamics)|negative semi-orbit]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma_x^-&lt;/math&gt; is  [[compact set|compact]], then the motion is said to be ''negatively Lagrange stable''. The motion through &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''Lagrange stable'' if it is both positively and negatively Lagrange stable. If the state space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then the above definitions are equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\gamma_x^+, \gamma_x^-&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_x&lt;/math&gt; being [[bounded set|bounded]], respectively.

A '''dynamical system''' is said to be positively-/negatively-/Lagrange stable if ''for each''  &lt;math&gt;x \in M &lt;/math&gt;, the motion &lt;math&gt;\Phi(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; is positively-/negativey-/Lagrange stable, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8026">In [[mathematics]], the researcher [[Sophus Lie]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː}} {{respell|LEE|'}}) initiated lines of study involving integration of [[differential equation]]s, [[transformation group]]s, and [[contact (mathematics)|contact]] of [[sphere]]s that have come to be called '''Lie theory'''.&lt;ref&gt;"Lie’s lasting achievements are the great theories he brought into existence. However, these theories – transformation groups, integration of differential equations, the geometry of contact – did not arise in a vacuum. They were preceded by particular results of a more limited scope, which pointed the way to more general theories that followed. The line-sphere correspondence is surely an example of this phenomenon: It so clearly sets the stage for Lie’s subsequent work on contact transformations and symmetry groups." R. Milson (2000) "An Overview of Lie’s line-sphere correspondence", pp 1–10 of ''The Geometric Study of Differential Equations'', J.A. Leslie &amp; T.P. Robart editors, [[American Mathematical Society]] {{ISBN|0-8218-2964-5}} , quotation pp 8,9&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the latter subject is [[Lie sphere geometry]]. This article addresses his approach to transformation groups, which is one of the [[areas of mathematics]], and was worked out by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Élie Cartan]].

The foundation of Lie theory is the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] relating [[Lie algebra]]s to [[Lie group]]s which is called the [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence]]. The subject is part of [[differential geometry]] since Lie groups are [[differentiable manifold]]s. Lie groups evolve out of the identity (1) and the [[tangent vector]]s to [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroups]] generate the Lie algebra. The structure of a Lie group is implicit in its algebra, and the structure of the Lie algebra is expressed by [[root system]]s and [[Root datum|root data]].

Lie theory has been particularly useful in [[mathematical physics]] since it describes important physical groups such as the [[Galilean group]], the [[Lorentz group]] and the [[Poincaré group]].

==Elementary Lie theory==
The [[one-parameter group]]s are the first instance of Lie theory. The [[compact space|compact]] case arises through [[Euler's formula]] in the [[complex plane]]. Other one-parameter groups occur in the [[split-complex number]] plane as the [[unit hyperbola]]
:&lt;math&gt;\lbrace \exp(i t) = \cosh(t) + i \sinh(t) : t \in R \rbrace,&lt;/math&gt;
and in the [[dual number]] plane as the line &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \exp(\varepsilon t) = 1 + \varepsilon t :  t \in R \rbrace.&lt;/math&gt;
In these cases the Lie algebra parameters have names: [[angle]], [[hyperbolic angle]], and [[slope]]. Using the appropriate "angle",  and a radial vector, any one of these planes can be given a [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]]. Any one of these decompositions, or Lie algebra renderings, may be necessary for rendering the Lie subalgebra of a [[2 × 2 real matrix]].

There is a classical 3-parameter Lie group and algebra pair: the [[versor|quaternions of unit length]] which can be identified with the [[3-sphere]]. Its Lie algebra is the subspace of [[quaternion]] vectors. Since the [[commutator]] ij &amp;minus; ji = 2k, the Lie bracket in this algebra is twice the [[cross product]] of ordinary [[vector analysis]].

Another elementary 3-parameter example is given by the [[Heisenberg group]] and its Lie algebra.
Standard treatments of Lie theory often begin with the [[classical group]]s.

==History and scope==
Early expressions of Lie theory are found in books composed by [[Sophus Lie]] with [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]] and [[Georg Scheffers]] from 1888 to 1896.

In Lie's early work, the idea was to construct a theory of ''continuous groups'', to complement the theory of [[discrete group]]s that had developed in the theory of [[modular form]]s, in the hands of [[Felix Klein]] and [[Henri Poincaré]]. The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of [[differential equation]]s. On the model of [[Galois theory]] and [[polynomial equation]]s, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of [[symmetry]], the whole area of [[ordinary differential equation]]s.

According to historian Thomas W. Hawkins, it was [[Élie Cartan]] that made Lie theory what it is:
:While Lie had many fertile ideas, Cartan was primarily responsible for the extensions and applications of his theory that have made it a basic component of modern mathematics. It was he who, with some help from [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]], developed the seminal, essentially algebraic ideas of [[Wilhelm Killing|Killing]] into the theory of the structure and representation of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s that plays such a fundamental role in present-day Lie theory. And although Lie envisioned applications of his theory to geometry, it was Cartan who actually created them, for example through his theories of symmetric and generalized spaces, including all the attendant apparatus ([[moving frame]]s, exterior [[differential form]]s, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hawkins (1996) ''[[Historia Mathematica]]'' 23(1):92–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of Lie theory==

Lie theory is frequently built upon a study of the classical [[linear algebraic group]]s. Special branches include [[Weyl group]]s, [[Coxeter group]]s, and [[Building (mathematics)|buildings]]. The classical subject has been extended to [[Group of Lie type|Groups of Lie type]].

In 1900 [[David Hilbert]] challenged Lie theorists with his [[Hilbert's fifth problem|Fifth Problem]] presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris.

In [[mathematics]], a '''limiting case''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a [[special case]] that arises when one or more components of the object take on their most extreme possible values. For example:

* In [[statistics]], the limiting case of the [[binomial distribution]] is the [[Poisson distribution]]. As the number of events tends to infinity in the binomial distribution, the random variable changes from the binomial to the Poisson distribution.
*A [[Circle#Circle as limiting case of other figures|circle is a limiting case]] of various other figures, including the [[Cartesian oval]], the [[ellipse]], the [[superellipse]], and the [[Cassini oval]]. Each type of figure is a circle for certain values of the defining parameters, and the generic figure appears more and more like a circle as the limiting values are approached.
*[[Archimedes]] calculated an approximate value of [[π]] by treating the circle as the limiting case of a [[regular polygon]] with 3 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sides, as ''n'' gets large.
*In [[electricity and magnetism]], the [[long wavelength limit]] is the limiting case when the [[wavelength]] is much larger than the system size.
*In [[economics]], two limiting cases of a [[demand curve]] or [[supply curve]] are those in which the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is zero (the totally inelastic case) or infinity (the infinitely elastic case).
*In [[finance]], [[continuous compounding]] is the limiting case of compound interest in which the compounding period becomes infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as the number of compounding periods per year goes to infinity.

A limiting case is sometimes a [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate case]] in which some qualitative properties differ from the corresponding [[Generic property|properties of the generic case]]. For example:

*A [[Point (geometry)|point]] is a degenerate [[circle]], namely one with [[radius]] 0.
*A [[parabola]] can degenerate into two distinct or coinciding [[parallel lines]].
*An [[ellipse]] can degenerate into a single point or a [[line segment]].
*A [[hyperbola]] can degenerate into two [[intersecting lines]].

There are no nonconvex Euclidean regular tessellations in any number of dimensions.

===Polytope elements===
The elements of a polytope can be considered according to either their own dimensionality or how many dimensions "down" they are from the body.

*[[Vertex (geometry)|Vertex]], a 0-dimensional element
*[[Edge (geometry)|Edge]], a 1-dimensional element
*[[Face (geometry)|Face]], a 2-dimensional element
*[[Cell (geometry)|Cell]], a 3-dimensional element
*[[Hypercell]] or Teron, a 4-dimensional element
*[[Facet (geometry)|Facet]], an (''n''-1)-dimensional element
*[[Ridge (geometry)|Ridge]], an (''n''-2)-dimensional element
*[[Peak (geometry)|Peak]], an (''n''-3)-dimensional element

For example, in a [[polyhedron]] (3-dimensional polytope), a face is a facet, an edge is a ridge, and a vertex is a peak.

*[[Vertex figure]]: not itself an element of a polytope, but a diagram showing how the elements meet.

===Tessellations===

The classical convex polytopes may be considered [[tessellation]]s, or tilings, of spherical space. Tessellations of euclidean and hyperbolic space may also be considered regular polytopes. Note that an 'n'-dimensional polytope actually tessellates a space of one dimension less. For example, the (three-dimensional) platonic solids tessellate the 'two'-dimensional 'surface' of the sphere.

===Zero dimension===
*[[Point (geometry)|Point]]

===One-dimensional regular polytope===

The '''Lotka–Volterra equations''', also known as the '''predator–prey equations''', are a pair of first-order [[nonlinear]] [[differential equation]]s, frequently used to describe the [[dynamical system|dynamics]] of [[Systems biology|biological systems]] in which two species interact, one as a [[predator]] and the other as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= \alpha x - \beta x y, \\
 \frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= \delta x y - \gamma y,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:{{mvar|x}} is the number of prey (for example, [[rabbit]]s);
:{{mvar|y}} is the number of some [[Predation|predator]] (for example, [[fox]]es);
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; represent the instantaneous growth rates of the two populations;
:{{mvar|t}} represents time;
:{{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} are positive real [[parameter]]s describing the interaction of the two [[species]].

The Lotka–Volterra system of equations is an example of a [[Kolmogorov]] model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freedman |first=H. I. |title=Deterministic Mathematical Models in Population Ecology |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brauer |first=F. |last2=Castillo-Chavez |first2=C. |title=Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoppensteadt |first=F. |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Predator-prey_model |title=Predator-prey model |work=[[Scholarpedia]] |volume=1 |issue=10 |page=1563 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a more general framework that can model the dynamics of ecological systems with predator–prey interactions, [[Competition_(biology)|competition]], disease, and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].

==History==
The Lotka–Volterra predator–prey [[mathematical model|model]] was initially proposed by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] in the theory of autocatalytic chemical reactions in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lotka|first=A. J.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Periodic Reaction|journal=[[Journal of Physical Chemistry A|J. Phys.

S.|display-authors=etal|title=On the Volterra and Other Non-Linear Models of Interacting Populations|location=|publisher=Academic Press|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was effectively the [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|logistic equation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berryman|first=A.

J.|pmc=1084562|title=Analytical Note on Certain Rhythmic Relations in Organic Systems|journal=[[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.]]|volume=6|issue=|pages=410–415|year=1920|doi=10.1073/pnas.6.7.410|pmid=16576509}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1925 he utilised the equations to analyse predator–prey interactions in his book on [[biomathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotka|first=A. J.|title=Elements of Physical Biology|location=|publisher=[[Williams and Wilkins]]|year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same set of equations was published in 1926 by [[Vito Volterra]], a mathematician and physicist, who had become interested in [[mathematical biology]].&lt;ref name="Goelmany"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volterra|first=V.|title=Variazioni e fluttuazioni del numero d’individui in specie animali conviventi|journal=[[Accademia dei Lincei|Mem.

N.|location=|publisher=[[McGraw–Hill]]|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volterra's enquiry was inspired through his interactions with the marine biologist [[Umberto D'Ancona]], who was courting his daughter at the time and later was to become his son-in-law. D'Ancona studied the fish catches in the [[Adriatic Sea]] and had noticed that the percentage of predatory fish caught had increased during the years of [[World War I]] (1914–18). This puzzled him, as the fishing effort had been very much reduced during the war years. Volterra developed his model independently from Lotka and used it to explain d'Ancona's observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kingsland|first=S.|title=Modeling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology|location=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0-226-43728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was later extended to include density-dependent prey growth and a [[functional response]] of the form developed by [[C. S. Holling]]; a model that has become known as the Rosenzweig–McArthur model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=M. L.|last2=MacArthur|first2=R.H.|year=1963|title=Graphical representation and stability conditions of predator-prey interactions|journal=American Naturalist|issue=|pages=209–223|doi=10.1086/282272|volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Lotka–Volterra and Rosenzweig–MacArthur models have been used to explain the dynamics of natural populations of predators and prey, such as the [[lynx]] and [[snowshoe hare]] data of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilpin|first=M. E.|year=1973|title=Do hares eat lynx?|journal=American Naturalist|issue=|pages=727–730|doi=10.1086/282870|volume=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the moose and wolf populations in [[Isle Royale National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=C.|last2=Devulder|first2=G.|last3=Vucetich|first3=J.A.|last4=Peterson|first4=R.|last5=Arditi|first5=R.|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00977.x|title=The wolves of Isle Royale display scale-invariant satiation and density dependent predation on moose|journal=J. Anim. Ecol.|volume=74|issue=5|pages=809–816|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, an alternative to the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model (and its common-prey-dependent generalizations) emerged, the ratio dependent or [[Arditi–Ginzburg equations|Arditi–Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arditi|first=R.|last2=Ginzburg|first2=L. R.|year=1989|url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf|title=Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: ratio dependence|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=139|issue=|pages=311–326|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(89)80211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of prey- or ratio-dependent models has been much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abrams|first=P. A.|last2=Ginzburg|first2=L.

The Lotka–Volterra equations have a long history of use in [[Economics|economic theory]]; their initial application is commonly credited to [[Richard M. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gandolfo|first=G.|authorlink=Giancarlo Gandolfo|title=Giuseppe Palomba and the Lotka–Volterra equations|journal=Rendiconti Lincei|volume=19|issue=4|pages=347–357|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s12210-008-0023-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=R.

==Physical meaning of the equations==
The Lotka–Volterra model makes a number of assumptions, not necessarily realizable in nature, about the environment and evolution of the predator and prey populations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/predator-prey.html|title=PREDATOR-PREY DYNAMICS|website=www.tiem.utk.edu|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The prey population finds ample food at all times.
#The food supply of the predator population depends entirely on the size of the prey population.
#The rate of change of population is proportional to its size.
#During the process, the environment does not change in favour of one species, and genetic adaptation is inconsequential.
#Predators have limitless appetite.

As differential equations are used, the solution is [[determinism|deterministic]] and [[Continuous function|continuous]]. This, in turn, implies that the generations of both the predator and prey are continually overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=D.|last2=Hiorns|first2=R. W.|display-authors=etal|title=The Mathematical Theory of the Dynamics of Biological Populations|volume=II|publisher=Academic Press|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations}}

===Prey===
When multiplied out, the prey equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta x y.&lt;/math&gt;

The prey are assumed to have an unlimited food supply and to reproduce exponentially, unless subject to predation; this [[exponential growth]] is represented in the equation above by the term ''αx''. The rate of predation upon the prey is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which the predators and the prey meet, this is represented above by ''βxy''. If either {{mvar|x}} or {{mvar|y}} is zero, then there can be no predation.

With these two terms the equation above can be interpreted as follows: the rate of change of the prey's population is given by its own growth rate minus the rate at which it is preyed upon.

===Predators===
The predator equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} = \delta xy - \gamma y.&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''δxy'' represents the growth of the predator population. (Note the similarity to the predation rate; however, a different constant is used, as the rate at which the predator population grows is not necessarily equal to the rate at which it consumes the prey). ''γy'' represents the loss rate of the predators due to either natural death or emigration, it leads to an exponential decay in the absence of prey.

Hence the equation expresses that the rate of change of the predator's population depends upon the rate at which it consumes prey, minus its intrinsic death rate.

The equations have [[periodic function|periodic]] solutions and do not have a simple expression in terms of the usual [[trigonometric function]]s, although they are quite tractable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Antonio|last2=Gander|first2=Martin Jakob|year=1999|title=Parametrische Lösungen der Räuber-Beute-Gleichungen im Vergleich|journal=Il Volterriano|volume=7|issue=|pages=32–44|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:6300/ATTACHMENT01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=C. M.|last2=Findley|first2=G. L.|title=A new transformation for the Lotka-Volterra problem|journal=Journal of Mathematical Chemistry|volume=25|issue=|pages=105–110|year=1999|doi=10.1023/A:1019172114300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If none of the non-negative parameters {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} vanishes, three can be absorbed into the normalization of variables to leave only one parameter: since the first equation is homogeneous in {{math|''x''}}, and the second one in {{math|''y''}}, the parameters ''β''/''α'' and ''δ''/''γ'' are absorbable in the normalizations of {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x''}} respectively, and {{math|''γ''}} into the normalization of {{math|''t''}}, so that only {{math|''α''/''γ''}} remains arbitrary. It is the only parameter affecting the nature of the solutions.

A [[linearization]] of the equations yields a solution similar to [[simple harmonic motion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tong|first=H.|title=Threshold Models in Non-linear Time Series Analysis|location=|publisher=Springer–Verlag|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the population of predators trailing that of prey by 90° in the cycle.

===A simple example===
Suppose there are two species of animals, a baboon (prey) and a cheetah (predator). If the initial conditions are 80 baboons and 40 cheetahs, one can plot the progression of the two species over time. The choice of time interval is arbitrary.
[[File:Cheetah Baboon LV.jpg|center]]

One may also plot solutions parametrically as [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s in [[phase space]], without representing time, but with one axis representing the number of prey and the other axis representing the number of predators for all times.

This corresponds to eliminating time from the two differential equations above to produce a single differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{y}{x} \frac{\delta x - \gamma}{\beta y -\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
relating the variables ''x'' and ''y''. The solutions of this equation are closed curves. It is amenable to [[separation of variables]]: integrating
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta y - \alpha}{y} \,dy + \frac{\delta x - \gamma}{x} \,dx = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
yields the implicit relationship 
: &lt;math&gt;V = \delta x - \gamma \ln(x) + \beta y - \alpha \ln(y),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is a constant quantity depending on the initial conditions and conserved on each curve.

[[File:CentralTendencyLV.jpg|center|Phase-space plot]]

An aside: These graphs illustrate a serious potential problem with this ''as a biological model'': For this specific choice of parameters, in each cycle, the baboon population is reduced to extremely low numbers, yet recovers (while the cheetah population remains sizeable at the lowest baboon density). In real-life situations, however, chance fluctuations of the discrete numbers of individuals, as well as the family structure and life-cycle of baboons, might cause the baboons to actually go extinct, and, by consequence, the cheetahs as well. This modelling problem has been called the "atto-fox problem", an [[atto-]]&lt;nowiki&gt;fox&lt;/nowiki&gt; being a notional 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; of a fox.&lt;ref name="LobrySari2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lobry |first1=Claude |last2=Sari |first2=Tewfik |title=Migrations in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model and the "atto-fox" problem |journal=Arima |date=2015 |volume=20 |pages=95-125 |url=http://arima.inria.fr/020/pdf/vol.20.pp.95-125.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mollison |first=D. |url=http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~denis/epi/velocities.pdf |title=Dependence of epidemic and population velocities on basic parameters |journal=Math.

===Phase-space plot of a further example===
A less extreme example covers: 
{{mvar|α}} = 2/3, {{mvar|β}} = 4/3, {{mvar|γ}} = 1 = {{mvar|δ}}. Assume {{math|''x'', ''y''}} quantify thousands each. Circles represent prey and predator initial conditions from {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}} = 0.9 to 1.8, in steps of 0.1. The fixed point is at (1, 1/2).
[[Image:Lotka-Volterra orbits 01.svg|center]]

==Dynamics of the system==
In the model system, the predators thrive when there are plentiful prey but, ultimately, outstrip their food supply and decline. As the predator population is low, the prey population will increase again. These dynamics continue in a cycle of growth and decline.

===Population equilibrium===
Population equilibrium occurs in the model when neither of the population levels is changing, i.e. when both of the derivatives are equal to 0:
:&lt;math&gt;x(\alpha - \beta y) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-y(\gamma - \delta x) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The above system of equations yields two solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;\{y = 0, x = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{y = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}, x = \frac{\gamma}{\delta} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, there are two equilibria.

The first solution effectively represents the extinction of both species. If both populations are at 0, then they will continue to be so indefinitely. The second solution represents a fixed point at which both populations sustain their current, non-zero numbers, and, in the simplified model, do so indefinitely. The levels of population at which this equilibrium is achieved depend on the chosen values of the parameters ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', and ''δ''.

===Stability of the fixed points===
The stability of the fixed point at the origin can be determined by performing a [[linearization]] using [[partial derivative]]s.

The [[Jacobian matrix]] of the predator–prey model is

:&lt;math&gt;J(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 
 \alpha - \beta y &amp; -\beta x \\
 \delta y &amp; \delta x - \gamma
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
and is known as [[community matrix]].

====First fixed point (extinction)====
When evaluated at the steady state of (0,&amp;nbsp;0), the Jacobian matrix ''J'' becomes

:&lt;math&gt;J(0, 0) = \begin{bmatrix}
 \alpha &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -\gamma
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[eigenvalue]]s of this matrix are

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = \alpha, \quad \lambda_2 = -\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

In the model ''α'' and ''γ'' are always greater than zero, and as such the sign of the eigenvalues above will always differ. Hence the fixed point at the origin is a [[saddle point]].

The stability of this fixed point is of significance. If it were stable, non-zero populations might be attracted towards it, and as such the dynamics of the system might lead towards the extinction of both species for many cases of initial population levels. However, as the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point, and hence unstable, it follows that the extinction of both species is difficult in the model. (In fact, this could only occur if the prey were artificially completely eradicated, causing the predators to die of starvation. If the predators were eradicated, the prey population would grow without bound in this simple model.) The populations of prey and predator can get infinitesimally close to zero and still recover.

====Second fixed point (oscillations)====
Evaluating ''J'' at the second fixed point leads to
:&lt;math&gt;J\left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right) = \begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; -\frac{\beta \gamma}{\delta} \\
 \frac{\alpha \delta}{\beta} &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues of this matrix are
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = i \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}, \quad \lambda_2 = -i \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As the eigenvalues are both purely imaginary and conjugate to each others, this fixed point is [[Dynamical system#Conjugation results|elliptic]], so the solutions are periodic, oscillating on a small ellipse around the fixed point, with a period &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} = \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

As illustrated in the circulating oscillations in the figure above, the level curves are closed [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s surrounding the fixed point: the levels of the predator and prey populations cycle and oscillate without [[damping]] around the fixed point with period &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of the [[constant of motion]] ''V'', or, equivalently, ''K'' = exp(''V''), &lt;math&gt;K = y^\alpha e^{-\beta y} x^\gamma e^{-\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;, can be found for the closed orbits near the fixed point.

Increasing ''K'' moves a closed orbit  closer to the fixed point. The largest value of the constant ''K'' is obtained by solving the optimization problem
:&lt;math&gt;y^\alpha e^{-\beta y} x^\gamma e^{-\delta x} = \frac{y^\alpha x^\gamma}{e^{\delta x+\beta y}} \longrightarrow \max\limits_{x,y&gt;0}.&lt;/math&gt;
The maximal value of ''K'' is thus attained at the stationary (fixed) point &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and amounts to 
:&lt;math&gt;K^* = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta e}\right)^\alpha \left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta e}\right)^\gamma,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''e'' is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]].

The '''Lwów school of mathematics''' ({{lang-pl|lwowska szkoła matematyczna}}) was a group of Polish [[mathematician]]s who worked between the two [[World War]]s in [[Lwów]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (since 1945 [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). The mathematicians often met at the famous [[Scottish Café]] to discuss mathematical problems, and published in the journal ''[[Studia Mathematica]]'', founded in 1929. The school was renowned for its productivity and its extensive contributions to subjects such as [[point-set topology]], [[set theory]] and [[functional analysis]]. The biographies and contributions of these mathematicians were documented in 1980 by their contemporary [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] in his book ''A Half Century of Polish Mathematics: Remembrances and Reflections''.

Many of the mathematicians, especially those of [[Jew]]ish background, fled this southeastern part of Poland in 1941 when it became clear that it would be invaded by [[Germany]]. Few of the mathematicians survived [[World War II]], but after the war a group including some of the original community carried on their work in western Poland's [[Wrocław]], the successor city to prewar Lwów; see [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)]]. A number of the prewar mathematicians, prominent among them [[Stanisław Ulam]], became famous for work done in the West.

Notable members of the Lwów school of mathematics included:
* [[Stefan Banach]]
* [[Feliks Barański]]
* [[Władysław Orlicz]]
* [[Stanisław Saks]]
* [[Hugo Steinhaus]]
* [[Stanisław Mazur]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''proof''' is an inferential argument for a [[Proposition|mathematical statement]]. In the [[Argument-deduction-proof distinctions|argument]], other previously established statements, such as [[theorems]], can be used. In principle, a proof can be traced back to self-evident or assumed statements, known as [[axiom]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Clapham, C.  |author2=Nicholson, JN.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Mathematics, Fourth edition |quote = A statement whose truth is either to be taken as self-evident or to be assumed. Certain areas of mathematics involve choosing a set of axioms and discovering what results can be derived from them, providing proofs for the theorems that are obtained.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nutsandbolts"&gt;Cupillari, Antonella. ''The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs''. Academic Press, 2001. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, Eric. ''Discrete Mathematics with Proof''. John Wiley and Sons, 2009. Definition 3.1 page 86. {{isbn|0-470-45793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with accepted rules of [[inference]].  Axioms may be treated as conditions that must be met before the statement applies.  Proofs are examples of exhaustive [[deductive reasoning]] or [[inductive reasoning]] and are distinguished from [[empirical evidence|empirical]] arguments or non-exhaustive [[inductive reasoning]] (or "reasonable expectation").  A proof must demonstrate that a statement is always true (occasionally by listing ''all'' possible cases and showing that it holds in each), rather than enumerate many confirmatory cases. An unproved proposition that is believed to be true is known as a [[conjecture]].

Proofs employ [[logic]] but usually include some amount of [[natural language]] which usually admits some ambiguity. In fact, the vast majority of proofs in written mathematics can be considered as applications of rigorous [[informal logic]]. Purely [[formal proof]]s, written in symbolic language instead of natural language, are considered in [[proof theory]]. The distinction between [[Proof theory#Formal and informal proof|formal and informal proofs]] has led to much examination of current and historical [[mathematical practice]], [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]], and so-called [[Mathematical folklore|folk mathematics]] (in both senses of that term). The [[philosophy of mathematics]] is concerned with the role of language and logic in proofs, and [[mathematics as a language]].

==History and etymology==
{{See also|History of logic}}

The word "proof" comes from the Latin ''probare'' meaning "to test". Related modern words are the English "probe", "probation", and "probability", the Spanish ''probar'' (to smell or taste, or (lesser use) touch or test),&lt;ref&gt;"proof" New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993, OUP, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian ''provare'' (to try), and the German ''probieren'' (to try).  The early use of "probity" was in the presentation of legal evidence.  A person of authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, whereby the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas about Probability, Induction and Statistical Inference|first = Ian|last =  Hacking|publisher = Cambridge University Press |date = 1984|isbn=0521318033|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2g0F1V5DywC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plausibility arguments using heuristic devices such as pictures and analogies preceded strict mathematical proof.&lt;ref name="Krantz"/&gt; It is likely that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with [[geometry]], which originally meant the same as "land measurement".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale, William]] and Martha, 1962. ''The development of logic''. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-824773-7}}. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of mathematical proof is primarily the product of [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematics]], and one of the greatest achievements thereof. [[Thales]] (624–546 BCE) and [[Hippocrates of Chios]] (c470-410 BCE) proved some theorems in geometry. [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (408–355 BCE) and [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] (417–369 BCE) formulated theorems but did not prove them. [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) said definitions should describe the concept being defined in terms of other concepts already known.  Mathematical proofs were revolutionized by [[Euclid]] (300 BCE), who introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still in use today, starting with [[undefined term]]s and [[axioms]] (propositions regarding the undefined terms assumed to be self-evidently true from the Greek "axios" meaning "something worthy"),  and used these to prove theorems using [[deductive logic]].  His book, the [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']], was read by anyone who was considered educated in the West until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{isbn|0-03-029558-0}} p. 141: "No work, except [[The Bible]], has been more widely used...."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to theorems of geometry, such as the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the ''Elements'' also covers number theory, including a proof that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Further advances took place in [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic mathematics]]. While earlier Greek proofs were largely geometric demonstrations, the development of [[arithmetic]] and [[algebra]] by Islamic mathematicians allowed more general proofs that no longer depended on geometry. In the 10th century CE, the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] mathematician [[Al-Hashimi]] provided general proofs for numbers (rather than geometric demonstrations) as he considered multiplication, division, etc. for "lines." He used this method to provide a proof of the existence of [[irrational number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Matvievskaya|first=Galina|year=1987|title=The Theory of Quadratic Irrationals in Medieval Oriental Mathematics|journal=[[New York Academy of Sciences|Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]]|volume=500|pages=253–277 [260]|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37206.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Mathematical induction|inductive proof]] for [[Arithmetic progression|arithmetic sequences]] was introduced in the ''Al-Fakhri'' (1000) by [[Al-Karaji]], who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]] and properties of [[Pascal's triangle]]. Alhazen also developed the method of [[proof by contradiction]], as the first attempt at proving the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] [[parallel postulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Eder |first=Michelle |year=2000 |title=Views of Euclid's Parallel Postulate in Ancient Greece and in Medieval Islam |url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers2000/eder.html |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |accessdate=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[proof theory]] treats proofs as inductively defined [[Data structure|data structures.]] There is no longer an assumption that axioms are "true" in any sense; this allows for parallel mathematical theories built on alternate sets of axioms (see [[Axiomatic set theory]] and [[Non-Euclidean geometry]] for examples).

==Nature and purpose==

As practiced, a proof is expressed in natural language and is a rigorous argument intended to convince the audience of the truth of a statement. The standard of rigor is not absolute and has varied throughout history. A proof can be presented differently depending on the intended audience. In order to gain acceptance, a proof has to meet communal statements of rigor; an [[argument]] considered vague or incomplete may be rejected.

The concept of a proof is formalized in the field of mathematical logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Handbook of Proof Theory|volume=137|series=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics|editor-first=Samuel R.|editor-last=Buss|editor-link=Samuel Buss|publisher=Elsevier|year=1998|isbn=9780080533186|contribution=An introduction to proof theory|pages=1–78|first=Samuel R.|last=Buss|authorlink=Samuel Buss}}. See in particular [https://books.google.com/books?id=MfTMDeCq7ukC&amp;pg=PA3 p.&amp;nbsp;3]: "The study of Proof Theory is traditionally motivated by the problem of formalizing mathematical proofs; the original formulation of first-order logic by Frege [1879] was the first successful step in this direction."&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal proof]] is written in a [[formal language]] instead of a natural language. A formal proof is defined as sequence of formulas in a formal language, in which each formula is a logical consequence of preceding formulas. Having a definition of formal proof makes the concept of proof amenable to study. Indeed, the field of [[proof theory]] studies formal proofs and their properties, for example, the property that a statement has a formal proof. An application of proof theory is to show that certain [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable statement]]s are not provable.

The definition of a formal proof is intended to capture the concept of proofs as written in the practice of mathematics. The soundness of this definition amounts to the belief that a published proof can, in principle, be converted into a formal proof. However, outside the field of automated proof assistants, this is rarely done in practice. A classic question in philosophy asks whether mathematical proofs are [[analytic proposition|analytic]] or [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]]. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who introduced the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]], believed mathematical proofs are synthetic. &lt;!-- [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] argued that mathematical proofs are analytic expressions, relying on no empirical observations or facts.&lt;ref&gt; Quine, Two Dogmas of Empiricism&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Proofs may be viewed as aesthetic objects, admired for their [[mathematical beauty]]. The mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] was known for describing proofs he found particularly elegant as coming from "The Book", a hypothetical tome containing the most beautiful method(s) of proving each theorem. The book ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]'', published in 2003, is devoted to presenting 32 proofs its editors find particularly pleasing.

=={{Anchor|Types of proof}}Methods==

===Direct proof===
{{Main|Direct proof}}

In direct proof, the conclusion is established by logically combining the axioms, definitions, and earlier theorems.&lt;ref&gt;Cupillari, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, direct proof can be used to establish that the sum of two [[Even and odd numbers|even]] [[integer]]s is always even:

:Consider two even integers ''x'' and ''y''. Since they are even, they can be written as ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''a'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''b'', respectively, for integers ''a'' and ''b''. Then the sum ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;= 2''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''b''&amp;nbsp;= 2(''a''+''b''). Therefore ''x''+''y'' has 2 as a factor and, by definition, is even. Hence the sum of any two even integers is even.

This proof uses the definition of even integers, the integer properties of [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]] under addition and multiplication, and [[distributivity]].

===Proof by mathematical induction===
{{Main|Mathematical induction}}
Despite its name, mathematical induction is a method of [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], not a form of [[inductive reasoning]]. In proof by mathematical induction, a single "base case" is proved, and an "induction rule" is proved that establishes that any arbitrary case [[Material conditional|implies]] the next case. Since in principle the induction rule can be applied repeatedly starting from the proved base case, we see that all (usually [[Infinite set|infinitely]] many) cases are provable.&lt;ref&gt;Cupillari, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids having to prove each case individually. A variant of mathematical induction is [[proof by infinite descent]], which can be used, for example, to prove the [[Square root of 2#Proofs of irrationality|irrationality of the square root of two]].

A common application of proof by mathematical induction is to prove that a property known to hold for one number holds for all natural numbers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~larryc/proofs/proofs.mathinduction.html Examples of simple proofs by mathematical induction for all natural numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;
Let {{math|1='''N''' = {1,2,3,4,...}}} be the set of natural numbers, and {{math|''P''(''n'')}} be a mathematical statement involving the natural number {{math|''n''}} belonging to {{math|'''N'''}} such that
* '''(i)''' {{math|''P''(1)}} is true, i.e., {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is true for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}.
* '''(ii)''' {{math|''P''(''n''+1)}} is true whenever {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is true, i.e., {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is true implies that {{math|''P''(''n''+1)}} is true.
* '''Then {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is true for all natural numbers {{math|''n''}}.'''

For example, we can prove by induction that all positive integers of the form {{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} are odd.  Let {{math|''P''(''n'')}} represent "{{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is odd":
:'''(i)''' For {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, {{math|1=2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2(1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1}}, and {{math|1}} is odd, since it leaves a remainder of {{math|1}} when divided by {{math|2}}. Thus {{math|''P''(1)}} is true.
:'''(ii)''' For any {{math|''n''}}, if {{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is odd ({{math|''P''(''n'')}}), then {{math|(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}} must also be odd, because adding {{math|2}} to an odd number results in an odd number.  But {{math|1=(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2(''n''+1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, so {{math|1=2(''n''+1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is odd ({{math|''P''(''n''+1)}}).  So {{math|''P''(''n'')}} implies {{math|''P''(''n''+1)}}.
:'''Thus''' {{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is odd, for all positive integers {{math|''n''}}.

The shorter phrase "proof by induction" is often used instead of "proof by mathematical induction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/AEAhelp/glossary/glossaryParser.php?glossaryFile=Proof%20by%20induction.htm Proof by induction], University of Warwick Glossary of Mathematical Terminology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof by contraposition===
{{Main|Contraposition}}
[[Proof by contrapositive|Proof by contraposition]] [[Rule of inference|infers]] the conclusion "if ''p'' then ''q''" from the premise "if ''not q'' then ''not p''". The statement "if ''not q'' then ''not p''" is called the [[contrapositive]] of the statement "if ''p'' then ''q''". For example, contraposition can be used to establish that, given an integer &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; is even, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is even:

: Suppose &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not even. Then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, hence &lt;math&gt; x^2  = x\cdot x &lt;/math&gt; is odd. Thus &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; is not even. Thus, if &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; ''is'' even, the supposition must be false, so &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; has to be even.

===Proof by contradiction===
{{Main|Proof by contradiction}}
In proof by contradiction (also known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', Latin for "by reduction to the absurd"), it is shown that if some statement were true, a logical contradiction occurs, hence the statement must be false.  A famous example of proof by contradiction shows that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[irrational number]]:

:Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; were a rational number, so by definition &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = {a\over b}&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are non-zero integers with [[coprime|no common factor]]. (If there is a common factor, divide both numerator and denominator by that factor to remove it, and repeat until no common factor remains.  By the method of infinite descent, this process must terminate.) Thus, &lt;math&gt;b\sqrt{2} = a&lt;/math&gt;. Squaring both sides yields 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since 2 divides the left hand side, 2 must also divide the right hand side (otherwise an even number would equal an odd number). So ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is even, which implies that ''a'' must also be even. So we can write ''a'' = 2''c'', where ''c'' is also an integer. Substitution into the original equation yields 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (2''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Dividing both sides by 2 yields ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But then, by the same argument as before, 2 divides ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so ''b'' must be even. However, if ''a'' and ''b'' are both even, they have a common factor, namely 2. This contradicts our initial supposition, so we are forced to conclude that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is an irrational number.

===Proof by construction===
{{Main|Proof by construction}}
Proof by construction, or proof by example, is the construction of a concrete example with a property to show that something having that property exists. [[Joseph Liouville]], for instance, proved the existence of [[transcendental number]]s by constructing an [[Liouville number|explicit example]].  It can also be used to construct a [[counterexample]] to disprove a proposition that all elements have a certain property.

===Proof by exhaustion===
{{Main|Proof by exhaustion}}
In proof by exhaustion, the conclusion is established by dividing it into a finite number of cases and proving each one separately. The number of cases sometimes can become very large. For example, the first proof of the [[four color theorem]] was a proof by exhaustion with 1,936 cases. This proof was controversial because the majority of the cases were checked by a computer program, not by hand. The shortest known proof of the four color theorem {{As of|2011|lc=on}} still has over 600 cases.

===Probabilistic proof===
{{Main|Probabilistic method}}
A probabilistic proof is one in which an example is shown to exist, with certainty, by using methods of [[probability theory]]. Probabilistic proof, like proof by construction, is one of many ways to show [[existence theorem]]s.

This is not to be confused with an argument that a theorem is 'probably' true, a 'plausibility argument'. The work on the [[Collatz conjecture]] shows how far plausibility is from genuine proof.

While most mathematicians do not think that probabilistic evidence ever counts as a genuine mathematical proof, a few mathematicians and philosophers have argued that at least some types of probabilistic evidence (such as Rabin's [[probabilistic algorithm]] for testing primality) are as good as genuine mathematical proofs.  &lt;ref&gt;Davis, Philip J. (1972), "Fidelity in Mathematical Discourse: Is One and One Really Two?" ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 79:252-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fallis, Don (1997), "The Epistemic Status of Probabilistic Proof." ''Journal of Philosophy'' 94:165-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorial proof===
{{Main|Combinatorial proof}}
A combinatorial proof establishes the equivalence of different expressions by showing that they count the same object in different ways. Often a [[Bijective proof|bijection]] between two sets is used to show that the expressions for their two sizes are equal. Alternatively, a [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting argument]] provides two different expressions for the size of a single set, again showing that the two expressions are equal.

===Nonconstructive proof===
{{Main|Nonconstructive proof}}
A nonconstructive proof establishes that a [[mathematical object]] with a certain property exists without explaining how such an object can be found. Often, this takes the form of a proof by contradiction in which the nonexistence of the object is proved to be impossible. In contrast, a constructive proof establishes that a particular object exists by providing a method of finding it. A famous example of a
nonconstructive proof shows that there exist two [[irrational number]]s ''a'' and ''b'' such that &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rational number]]:
:Either &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is a rational number and we are done (take &lt;math&gt;a=b=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;), or &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational so we can write &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This then gives &lt;math&gt;\left (\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right )^{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}^{2}=2&lt;/math&gt;, which is thus a rational of the form &lt;math&gt;a^b.&lt;/math&gt;

===Statistical proofs in pure mathematics===
{{Main| Statistical proof}}
The expression "statistical proof" may be used technically or colloquially in areas of [[pure mathematics]], such as involving [[cryptography]], [[chaotic series]], and probabilistic or analytic [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"in number theory and commutative algebra... in particular the statistical proof of the lemma." [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2686395]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Whether constant π (i.e., pi) is normal is a confusing problem without any strict theoretical demonstration except for some '''statistical''' proof"" (Derogatory use.)[http://www.springerlink.com/content/nj34v59p71m11125/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"these observations suggest a statistical proof of Goldbach's conjecture with very quickly vanishing probability of failure for large E" [http://people.web.psi.ch/gassmann/eneseminare/abstracts/Goldbach1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is less commonly used to refer to a mathematical proof in the branch of mathematics known as [[mathematical statistics]].  See also "[[#Colloquial use, Statistical proof using data|Statistical proof using data]]" section below.

===Computer-assisted proofs===
{{Main|Computer-assisted proof }}
Until the twentieth century it was assumed that any proof could, in principle, be checked by a competent mathematician to confirm its validity.&lt;ref name="Krantz"&gt;[http://www.math.wustl.edu/~sk/eolss.pdf The History and Concept of Mathematical Proof], Steven G. Krantz. 1. February 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, computers are now used both to prove theorems and to carry out calculations that are too long for any human or team of humans to check; the first proof of the [[four color theorem]] is an example of a computer-assisted proof. Some mathematicians are concerned that the possibility of an error in a computer program or a run-time error in its calculations calls the validity of such computer-assisted proofs into question. In practice, the chances of an error invalidating a computer-assisted proof can be reduced by incorporating redundancy and self-checks into calculations, and by developing multiple independent approaches and programs. Errors can never be completely ruled out in case of verification of a proof by humans either, especially if the proof contains natural language and requires deep mathematical insight.

==Undecidable statements==
A statement that is neither provable nor disprovable from a set of axioms is called undecidable (from those axioms). One example is the [[parallel postulate]], which is neither provable nor refutable from the remaining axioms of [[Euclidean geometry]].

Mathematicians have shown there are many statements that are neither provable nor disprovable in [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] with the axiom of choice (ZFC), the standard system of set theory in mathematics (assuming that ZFC is consistent); see [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC]].

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's (first) incompleteness theorem]] shows that many axiom systems of mathematical interest will have undecidable statements.

==Heuristic mathematics and experimental mathematics==
{{Main|Experimental mathematics}}
While early mathematicians such as [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] did not use proofs, from [[Euclid]] to the [[foundational mathematics]] developments of the late 19th and 20th centuries, proofs were an essential part of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;"''What to do with the pictures? Two thoughts surfaced: the first was that they were unpublishable in the standard way, there were no theorems only very suggestive pictures. They furnished convincing evidence for many conjectures and lures to further exploration, but theorems were coins of the realm and the conventions of that day dictated that journals only published theorems''", [[David Mumford]], Caroline Series and David Wright, [[Indra's Pearls (book)|Indra's Pearls]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in computing power in the 1960s, significant work began to be done investigating [[mathematical objects]] outside of the proof-theorem framework,&lt;ref&gt;"''Mandelbrot, working at the IBM Research Laboratory, did some computer simulations for these sets on the reasonable assumption that, if you wanted to prove something, it might be helpful to know the answer ahead of time.''"[http://home.att.net/~fractalia/history.htm A Note on the History of Fractals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215114618/http://home.att.net/~fractalia/history.htm |date=2009-02-15 }},&lt;/ref&gt; in [[experimental mathematics]]. Early pioneers of these methods intended the work ultimately to be embedded in a classical proof-theorem framework, e.g. the early development of [[fractal geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;"''... brought home again to Benoit [Mandelbrot] that there was a 'mathematics of the eye', that visualization of a problem was as valid a method as any for finding a solution. Amazingly, he found himself alone with this conjecture. The teaching of mathematics in France was dominated by a handful of dogmatic mathematicians hiding behind the pseudonym 'Bourbaki'... ''", Introducing Fractal Geometry, Nigel Lesmoir-Gordon&lt;/ref&gt; which was ultimately so embedded.

==Related concepts==

===Visual proof===
Although not a formal proof, a visual demonstration of a mathematical theorem is sometimes called a "[[proof without words]]". The left-hand picture below is an example of a historic visual proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] in the case of the (3,4,5) triangle.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|Visual proof for the (3, 4, 5) triangle as in the [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] 500–200&amp;nbsp;BC.
File:Pythagoras-2a.gif|Animated visual proof for the Pythagorean theorem by rearrangement.
File:Pythag anim.gif|A second animated proof of the Pythagorean theorem.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some illusory visual proofs, such as the [[missing square puzzle]], can be constructed in a way which appear to prove a supposed mathematical fact but only do so under the presence of tiny errors (for example, supposedly straight lines which actually bend slightly) which are unnoticeable until the entire picture is closely examined, with lengths and angles precisely measured or calculated.

===Elementary proof===
{{Main|Elementary proof}}
An elementary proof is a proof which only uses basic techniques. More specifically, the term is used in [[number theory]] to refer to proofs that make no use of [[complex analysis]]. For some time it was thought that certain theorems, like the [[prime number theorem]], could only be proved using "higher" mathematics. However, over time, many of these results have been reproved using only elementary techniques.

===Two-column proof===
[[File:twocolumnproof.png|thumb|right|A two-column proof published in 1913]]

A particular way of organising a proof using two parallel columns is often used in elementary geometry classes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Patricio G. Herbst, Establishing a Custom of Proving in American School Geometry: Evolution of the Two-Column Proof in the Early Twentieth Century, Educational Studies in Mathematics, Vol. 49, No. 3 (2002), pp. 283-312,&lt;/ref&gt; The proof is written as a series of lines in two columns. In each line, the left-hand column contains a proposition, while the right-hand column contains a brief explanation of how the corresponding proposition in the left-hand column is either an axiom, a hypothesis, or can be logically derived from previous propositions. The left-hand column is typically headed "Statements" and the right-hand column is typically headed "Reasons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onemathematicalcat.org/Math/Geometry_obj/two_column_proof.htm Introduction to the Two-Column Proof], Carol Fisher&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colloquial use of "mathematical proof"===
The expression "mathematical proof" is used by lay people to refer to using mathematical methods or arguing with [[mathematical objects]], such as numbers, to demonstrate something about everyday life, or when data used in an argument is numerical. It is sometimes also used to mean a "statistical proof" (below), especially when used to argue from [[data]].

===Statistical proof using data===
{{Main|Statistical proof}}
"Statistical proof" from data refers to the application of [[statistics]], [[data analysis]], or [[Bayesian analysis]] to infer propositions regarding the [[probability]] of [[data]]. While ''using'' mathematical proof to establish theorems in statistics, it is usually not a mathematical proof in that the ''assumptions'' from which probability statements are derived require empirical evidence from outside mathematics to verify. In [[physics]], in addition to statistical methods, "statistical proof" can refer to the specialized ''[[mathematical methods of physics]]'' applied to analyze data in a [[particle physics]] [[experiment]] or [[observational study]] in [[physical cosmology]]. "Statistical proof" may also refer to raw data or a convincing diagram involving data, such as [[scatter plot]]s, when the data or diagram is adequately convincing without further analysis.

===Inductive logic proofs and Bayesian analysis===
{{Main|Inductive logic|Bayesian analysis}}
Proofs using [[inductive logic]], while considered mathematical in nature, seek to establish propositions with a degree of certainty, which acts in a similar manner to [[probability]], and may be less than full [[certainty]]. Inductive logic should not be confused with [[mathematical induction]].

Bayesian analysis uses [[Bayes' theorem]] to update a person's [[Bayesian probability|assessment of likelihoods]] of hypotheses when new [[evidence]] or [[information]] is acquired.

===Proofs as mental objects===
{{Main|Psychologism|Language of thought}}
Psychologism views mathematical proofs as psychological or mental objects.  Mathematician [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Frege]], and [[Carnap]] have variously criticized this view and attempted to develop a semantics for what they considered to be the [[language of thought]], whereby standards of mathematical proof might be applied to [[empirical science]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Influence of mathematical proof methods outside mathematics===
Philosopher-mathematicians such as [[Spinoza]] have attempted to formulate philosophical arguments in an axiomatic manner, whereby mathematical proof standards could be applied to argumentation in general philosophy. Other mathematician-philosophers have tried to use standards of mathematical proof and reason, without empiricism, to arrive at statements outside of mathematics, but having the [[certainty]] of propositions deduced in a mathematical proof, such as [[Descartes]]' [[cogito ergo sum|''cogito'']] argument.

==Ending a proof==
{{Main|Q.E.D.}}
Sometimes, the abbreviation ''"Q.E.D."'' is written to indicate the end of a proof. This abbreviation stands for ''"Quod Erat Demonstrandum"'', which is [[Latin]] for ''"that which was to be demonstrated"''. A more common{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} alternative is to use a square or a rectangle, such as □ or ∎, known as a "[[tombstone (typography)|tombstone]]" or "halmos" after its [[eponym]] [[Paul Halmos]]. Often, "which was to be shown" is verbally stated when writing "QED", "□", or "∎" during an oral presentation.

{{Educational research}}{{Merge from|Computer-based mathematics education|date=February 2018}}
In contemporary [[education]], '''mathematics education''' is the practice of [[teaching]] and [[learning]] [[mathematics]], along with the associated scholarly [[research]].

Researchers in mathematics education are primarily concerned with the tools, methods and approaches that facilitate practice or the study of practice; however, [[List of mathematics education journals|mathematics education research]], known on the continent of Europe as the [[didactics]] or [[pedagogy]] of mathematics, has developed into an extensive field of study, with its own concepts, theories, methods, national and international organisations, conferences and literature. This article describes some of the history, influences and recent controversies.

==History==
Elementary mathematics was part of the [[Education|education system]] in most ancient civilisations, including [[Ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], [[Vedic civilization|Vedic society]] and [[ancient Egypt]]. In most cases, a formal education was only available to [[male]] children with a sufficiently high status, wealth or [[caste]].
[[File:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration at the beginning of a 14th-century translation of Euclid's ''Elements''.]]

In [[Plato]]'s division of the [[liberal arts]] into the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and the [[quadrivium]], the quadrivium included the mathematical fields of [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]]. This structure was continued in the structure of [[Medieval university|classical education]] that was developed in medieval Europe. Teaching of geometry was almost universally based on [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements''. Apprentices to trades such as masons, merchants and money-lenders could expect to learn such practical mathematics as was relevant to their profession.

In the [[Renaissance]], the academic status of mathematics declined, because it was strongly associated with trade and commerce, and considered somewhat un-Christian.&lt;ref name="taboo"&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=486172977 |title=Why We Learn Math Lessons That Date Back 500 Years |date=23 Jul 2016 |author=Gabrielle Emanuel |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it continued to be taught in European universities, it was seen as subservient to the study of [[Natural Philosophy|Natural]], [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] and [[Moral philosophy|Moral]] Philosophy.  The first modern arithmetic curriculum (starting with addition, then subtraction, multiplication, and division) arose at [[reckoning school]]s in Italy in the 1300s.&lt;ref name="taboo2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/23/486172977/a-history-lesson-when-math-was-taboo Why We Learn Math Lessons That Date Back 500 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;  Spreading along trade routes, these methods were designed to be used in commerce. They contrasted with Platonic math taught at universities, which was more philosophical and concerned numbers as concepts rather than calculating methods.&lt;ref name="taboo2" /&gt;  They also contrasted with mathematical methods learned by [[artisan]] apprentices, which were specific to the tasks and tools at hand. For example, the division of a board into thirds can be accomplished with a piece of string, instead of measuring the length and using the arithmetic operation of division.&lt;ref name="taboo" /&gt;

The first mathematics textbooks to be written in English and French were published by [[Robert Recorde]], beginning with ''The Grounde of Artes'' in 1540. However, there are many different writings on mathematics and mathematics methodology that date back to 1800 BCE.  These were mostly located in Mesopotamia where the Sumerians were practicing multiplication and division.  There are also artifacts demonstrating their own methodology for solving equations like the quadratic equation.  After the Sumerians some of the most famous ancient works on mathematics come from Egypt in the form of the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]].  The more famous [[Rhind Papyrus]] has been dated to approximately 1650 BCE but it is thought to be a copy of an even older scroll.  This papyrus was essentially an early textbook for Egyptian students.

The social status of mathematical study was improving by the seventeenth century, with the [[University of Aberdeen]] creating a Mathematics Chair in 1613, followed by the Chair in Geometry being set up in [[University of Oxford]] in 1619 and the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Chair of Mathematics]] being established by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1662. However, it was uncommon for mathematics to be taught outside of the universities.{{fact|date=April 2018}} [[Isaac Newton]], for example, received no formal mathematics teaching until he joined [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1661.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to an enormous increase in [[urban area|urban]] populations. Basic numeracy skills, such as the ability to tell the time, count money and carry out simple [[arithmetic]], became essential in this new urban lifestyle. Within the new [[public education]] systems, mathematics became a central part of the curriculum from an early age.

By the twentieth century, mathematics was part of the core curriculum in all [[developed country|developed countries]].

During the twentieth century, mathematics education was established as an independent field of research. Here are some of the main events in this development:

* In 1893, a Chair in mathematics education was created at the University of Göttingen, under the administration of [[Felix Klein]]
* The [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] (ICMI) was founded in 1908, and Felix Klein became the first president of the organisation
* The professional [[periodical literature]] on mathematics education in the U.S.A. had generated more than 4000 articles after 1920, so in 1941 William L. Schaaf published a [[subject indexing|classified index]], sorting them into their various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Schaaf (1941) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b417103;view=1up;seq=11 A Bibliography of Mathematical Education], Forest Hills, N.Y. : Stevinus Press, link from [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A renewed interest in mathematics education emerged in the 1960s, and the International Commission was revitalised
* In 1968, the [[Shell Centre for Mathematical Education]] was established in [[Nottingham]]
* The first [[International Congress on Mathematical Education]] (ICME) was held in [[Lyon]] in 1969. The second congress was in [[Exeter]] in 1972, and after that it has been held every four years

In the 20th century, the cultural impact of the "[[Information Age|electronic age]]" (McLuhan) was also taken up by [[educational theory]] and the teaching of mathematics. While previous approach focused on "working with specialized 'problems' in [[arithmetic]]", the emerging structural approach to knowledge had "small children meditating about [[number theory]] and '[[set theory|sets]]'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 {{cite web|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208070250/http://georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At different times and in different cultures and countries, mathematics education has attempted to achieve a variety of different objectives. These objectives have included:

* The teaching and learning of basic [[numeracy]] skills to all pupils
* The teaching of practical mathematics ([[arithmetic]], [[elementary algebra]], plane and solid [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]]) to most pupils, to equip them to follow a trade or craft
* The teaching of abstract mathematical concepts (such as [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and [[function (mathematics)|function]]) at an early age
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as [[Euclidean geometry]]) as an example of an [[axiomatic system]] and a model of [[deductive reasoning]]
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as [[calculus]]) as an example of the intellectual achievements of the [[modern world]]
* The teaching of advanced mathematics to those pupils who wish to follow a career in [[STEM fields|Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)]] fields.
* The teaching of [[heuristics]] and other problem-solving strategies to solve non-routine problems.

==Methods==

The method or methods used in any particular context are largely determined by the objectives that the relevant educational system is trying to achieve. Methods of teaching mathematics include the following:

* '''Classical education''': the teaching of mathematics within the [[quadrivium]], part of the classical education curriculum of the [[Middle Ages]], which was typically based on [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] taught as a [[paradigm]] of [[deductive reasoning]].
[[File:Number bingo improves math skills LPB Laos.jpg|thumb|Games can motivate students to improve skills that are usually learned by rote. In "Number Bingo," players roll 3 dice, then perform basic mathematical operations on those numbers to get a new number, which they cover on the board trying to cover 4 squares in a row. This game was played at a "Discovery Day" organized by [[Big Brother Mouse]] in Laos.]]
* '''[[Computer-based math]]''' an approach based around use of mathematical software as the primary tool of computation. Mobile applications have also been developed to help students learn mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/06/passing-mathematics-just-got-easier-for-students-with-this-new-platform-mathematica/|title=Passing Mathematics Just Got Easier For Students With This New Platform: Mathematica - Techzim|date=2018-06-16|work=Techzim|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2017/10/5-apps-help-all-students-math|title=5 Apps to Help All Students with Math|date=2017-10-13|work=Technology Solutions That Drive Education|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/22/photomath-app-solve-math-problems_n_6025948.html|title=This Free App Will Solve Math Problems For You|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=2014-10-22|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conventional approach''': the gradual and systematic guiding through the hierarchy of mathematical notions, ideas and techniques. Starts with [[arithmetic]] and is followed by [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[elementary algebra]] taught concurrently. Requires the instructor to be well informed about [[elementary mathematics]], since didactic and curriculum decisions are often dictated by the logic of the subject rather than pedagogical considerations. Other methods emerge by emphasizing some aspects of this approach.
* '''[[Exercise (mathematics)|Exercise]]s''': the reinforcement of mathematical skills by completing large numbers of exercises of a similar type, such as adding [[vulgar fraction]]s or solving [[quadratic equation]]s.
* '''Historical method''': teaching the [[history of mathematics|development of mathematics]] within an historical, social and cultural context. Provides more [[human interest]] than the conventional approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bharath |last=Sriraman |title=Crossroads in the History of Mathematics and Mathematics Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P38a50_NT8oC |year=2012 |publisher=IAP |isbn=978-1-61735-704-6 |series=Monograph Series in Mathematics Education |volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mathematics mastery|Mastery]]''': an approach in which most students are expected to achieve a high level of competence before progressing
* '''[[New Math]]''': a method of teaching mathematics which focuses on abstract concepts such as [[set theory]], functions and bases other than ten. Adopted in the US as a response to the challenge of early Soviet technical superiority in space, it began to be challenged in the late 1960s. One of the most influential critiques of the New Math was [[Morris Kline]]'s 1973 book ''[[Why Johnny Can't Add]]''. The New Math method was the topic of one of [[Tom Lehrer]]'s most popular parody songs, with his introductory remarks to the song: "...in the new approach, as you know, the important thing is to understand what you're doing, rather than to get the right answer."
* '''[[Problem solving]]''': the cultivation of mathematical ingenuity, creativity and [[heuristic]] thinking by setting students open-ended, unusual, and sometimes unsolved problems. The problems can range from simple [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problem]]s to problems from international [[mathematics competitions]] such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. Problem solving is used as a means to build new mathematical knowledge, typically by building on students' prior understandings.
* '''[[Recreational mathematics]]''': Mathematical problems that are fun can motivate students to learn mathematics and can increase enjoyment of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=David Singmaster |first=David |last=Singmaster |title=The Unreasonable Utility of Recreational Mathematics |date=7 September 1993 |work=For First European Congress of Mathematics, Paris, July, 1992 |url=http://anduin.eldar.org/%7Eproblemi/singmast/ecmutil.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Reform mathematics|Standards-based mathematics]]''': a vision for pre-college mathematics education in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]], focused on deepening student understanding of mathematical ideas and procedures, and formalized by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] which created the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]].
* '''Relational approach''': Uses class topics to solve everyday problems and relates the topic to current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-kfield1/203currentevent.htm%20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120085344/http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-kfield1/203currentevent.htm |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach focuses on the many uses of mathematics and helps students understand why they need to know it as well as helping them to apply mathematics to real world situations outside of the classroom.
* '''[[Rote learning]]''': the teaching of mathematical results, definitions and concepts by repetition and memorisation typically without meaning or supported by mathematical reasoning. A derisory term is ''drill and kill''. In [[traditional education]], rote learning is used to teach [[multiplication table]]s, definitions, formulas, and other aspects of mathematics.

==Content and age levels==
Different levels of mathematics are taught at different ages and in somewhat different sequences in different countries. Sometimes a class may be taught at an earlier age than typical as a special or [[honors class]].

Elementary mathematics in most countries is taught in a similar fashion, though there are differences. In the [[Mathematics education in the United States|United States]] fractions are typically taught starting from 1st grade, whereas in other countries they are usually taught later, since the metric system does not require young children to be familiar with them.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Most countries tend to cover fewer topics in greater depth than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foundations for Success: The Final Report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel |year=2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf |page=20 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  K-12 topics include [[elementary arithmetic]] (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and [[pre-algebra]].

In most of the U.S., [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and analysis ([[pre-calculus]] and [[calculus]]) are taught as separate courses in different years of high school. Mathematics in most other countries (and in a few U.S. states) is integrated, with topics from all branches of mathematics studied every year. Students in many countries choose an option or pre-defined course of study rather than choosing courses ''à la carte'' as in the United States. Students in science-oriented curricula typically study [[differential calculus]] and [[trigonometry]] at age 16–17 and [[integral calculus]], [[complex numbers]], [[analytic geometry]], [[exponential function|exponential]] and [[logarithmic function]]s, and [[infinite series]] in their final year of secondary school. [[Probability]] and [[statistics]] may be taught in secondary education classes.

Science and engineering students in colleges and universities may be required to take [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential equations]], [[linear algebra]].  [[Applied mathematics]] is also used in specific majors; for example, [[civil engineers]] may be required to study [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cee.mit.edu/undergraduate/1C-degreerequirements |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233214/https://cee.mit.edu/undergraduate/1C-degreerequirements |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while "math for computer science" might include [[graph theory]], [[permutation]], probability, and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics students would continue to study potentially any area.

==Standards==
Throughout most of history, standards for mathematics education were set locally, by individual schools or teachers, depending on the levels of achievement that were relevant to, realistic for, and considered socially appropriate for their pupils.

In modern times, there has been a move towards regional or national standards, usually under the umbrella of a wider standard school curriculum. In [[England]], for example, standards for mathematics education are set as part of the National Curriculum for England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mathematics curriculum |date=17 January 2013 |publisher=UK Department of Education |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/secondary/b00199003/mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Scotland maintains its own educational system. In the USA, the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers have published the national mathematics [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].

Ma (2000) summarised the research of others who found, based on nationwide data, that students with higher scores on standardised mathematics tests had taken more mathematics courses in high school. This led some states to require three years of mathematics instead of two. But because this requirement was often met by taking another lower level mathematics course, the additional courses had a “diluted” effect in raising achievement levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ma, X. |title=A longitudinal assessment of antecedent course work in mathematics and subsequent mathematical attainment |journal=Journal of Educational Research |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=16–29 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/00220670009598739 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220670009598739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] has published the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]], which boosted the trend towards [[reform mathematics]]. In 2006, they released ''Curriculum Focal Points'', which recommend the most important mathematical topics for each grade level through grade 8.  However, these standards are enforced as American states and Canadian provinces choose. A US state's adoption of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics is at the discretion of the state, and is not mandated by the Federal Government. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/myths-vs-facts/&lt;/ref&gt;"States routinely review their academic standards and may choose to change or add onto the standards to best meet the needs of their students." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has state affiliates that have different education standards at the state level. For example, Missouri has the Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics (MCTM) which has its own pillars and standards of education listed on its website. The MCTM also offers membership opportunities to teachers and future teachers so they can stay up to date on the changes in math educational standards. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.moctm.org/Home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

"Robust, useful theories of classroom teaching do not yet exist".&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws&gt;{{Citation | last = Hiebert | first = James | last2 = Grouws | first2 = Douglas | title = The Effects of Classroom Mathematics Teaching on Students' Learning | place = Reston VA | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | volume = 1 | year = 2007 | chapter = 9 | pages = 371–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are useful theories on how children learn mathematics and much research has been conducted in recent decades to explore how these theories can be applied to teaching. The following results are examples of some of the current findings in the field of mathematics education:

;Important results&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt;
:One of the strongest results in recent research is that the most important feature in effective teaching is giving students "opportunity to learn". Teachers can set expectations, time, kinds of tasks, questions, acceptable answers, and type of discussions that will influence students' opportunity to learn. This must involve both skill efficiency and conceptual understanding.

;Conceptual understanding&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt;
:Two of the most important features of teaching in the promotion of conceptual understanding are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Institute of Education Sciences | contribution = Highlights From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study of Eighth-Grade Mathematics Teaching | year = 2003 | publisher = U.S. Department of Education | url = http://nces.ed.gov/timss}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.

:Deliberate, productive struggle with mathematical ideas refers to the fact that when students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, even if this struggle initially involves confusion and errors, the end result is greater learning. This has been shown to be true whether the struggle is due to challenging, well-implemented teaching, or due to faulty teaching the students must struggle to make sense of.
 
;Formative assessment&lt;ref name=BlackWiliam&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=P. |last2=Wiliam |first2=Dylan |title=Assessment and Classroom Learning |journal=Assessment in Education |year=1998 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=7–74 |doi=10.1080/0969595980050102 |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/t4/learningandteaching/files/PGCTHE/BlackandWiliam1998.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Formative assessment]] is both the best and cheapest way to boost student achievement, student engagement and teacher professional satisfaction. Results surpass those of reducing class size or increasing teachers' content knowledge. Effective assessment is based on clarifying what students should know, creating appropriate activities to obtain the evidence needed, giving good feedback, encouraging students to take control of their learning and letting students be resources for one another.

;Homework&lt;ref name=ResearchClips&gt;[http://www.nctm.org/news/content.aspx?id=8468 Research clips and briefs]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Homework which leads students to practice past lessons or prepare future lessons are more effective than those going over today's lesson. Students benefit from feedback. Students with learning disabilities or low motivation may profit from rewards. For younger children, homework helps simple skills, but not broader measures of achievement.

;Students with difficulties&lt;ref name=ResearchClips/&gt;
:Students with genuine difficulties (unrelated to motivation or past instruction) struggle with [[Recall of facts|basic facts]], answer impulsively, struggle with mental representations, have poor [[number sense]] and have poor short-term memory. Techniques that have been found productive for helping such students include peer-assisted learning, explicit teaching with visual aids, instruction informed by [[formative assessment]] and encouraging students to think aloud.

;Algebraic reasoning&lt;ref name=ResearchClips/&gt;
:It is important for elementary school children to spend a long time learning to express algebraic properties without symbols before learning algebraic notation. When learning symbols, many students believe letters always represent unknowns and struggle with the concept of [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. They prefer arithmetic reasoning to algebraic equations for solving word problems. It takes time to move from arithmetic to algebraic generalizations to describe patterns. Students often have trouble with the minus sign and understand the [[equals sign]] to mean "the answer is...."

===Methodology===
As with other educational research (and the social sciences in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. [[Quantitative research]] includes studies that use [[inferential statistics]] to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods in order to test their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.

[[Qualitative research]], such as [[case studies]], [[action research]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[Jean Piaget|clinical interviews]], depend on small but focused samples in an attempt to understand student learning and to look at how and why a given method gives the results it does. Such studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood ''why'' treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to "lethal mutations"&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt; of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0013189X034005025 | last = Raudenbush | first = Stephen | title = Learning from Attempts to Improve Schooling: The Contribution of Methodological Diversity | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 25–31 | year = 2005 | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/5/25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.

====Randomized trials====
There has been some controversy over the relative strengths of different types of research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas D. |last=Cook |title=Randomized Experiments in Educational Policy Research: A Critical Examination of the Reasons the Educational Evaluation Community has Offered for Not Doing Them |journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–199 |year=2002 |doi=10.3102/01623737024003175 |url=http://epa.sagepub.com/content/24/3/175.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheaffer&gt;{{cite web |author=Working Group on Statistics in Mathematics Education Research |title=Using Statistics Effectively in Mathematics Education Research: A report from a series of workshops organized by the American Statistical Association with funding from the National Science Foundation |year=2007 |publisher=The American Statistical Association |url=http://www.amstat.org/research_grants/pdfs/SMERReport.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shadish, William R. |author2=Cook, Thomas D. |author3=Campbell, Donald T. |year=2002 |title=Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for generalized causal inference |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-395-61556-9 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See articles on [[No Child Left Behind|NCLB]], [[National Mathematics Advisory Panel]], [[Scientifically based research]] and [[What Works Clearinghouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods.&lt;ref name=Scheaffer/&gt; On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the United States, the [[Math_wars#National_Mathematics_Advisory_Panel|National Mathematics Advisory Panel]] (NMAP) published a report in 2008 based on studies, some of which used randomized assignment of treatments to [[experimental unit]]s, such as classrooms or students.

==Mathematics educators==
The following are some of the people who have had a significant influence on the teaching of mathematics at various periods in history:

* [[Euclid]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 300 BC), Ancient Greek, author of ''[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]]''
* [[Felix Klein]] (1849 - 1925), German mathematician who had substantial influence on math education in the early 20th Century, Inaugural president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction
* [[Andrei Petrovich Kiselyov]] (1852 – 1940) [[Russia]]n and [[USSR|Soviet]] mathematician. His textbooks on basic arithmetics, algebra and geometry were the standard for Russian classrooms since 1892 well into the 1960s, when Russian mathematics education got embroiled in the [[New Math]] reforms. In 2006 these texbooks were re-printed and became popular again.

*[[Robert M. Gagné]] (1958–1980s), pioneer in mathematics education research.

==Mathematics teachers==
The following people all taught mathematics at some stage in their lives, although they are better known for other things:

One of the main tools for determining the existence of (or non-existence of) chaos in a perturbed [[Hamiltonian system]] is Melnikov theory. In this theory, the distance between the stable and unstable manifolds of the perturbed system is calculated up to the first-order term. Consider a smooth dynamical system &lt;math&gt;\ddot x = f(x) + \epsilon g(t)&lt;/math&gt;,  with &lt;math&gt; \epsilon \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; periodic with period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt; the system has a [[hyperbolic fixed point]] x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a [[homoclinic orbit]] &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to this [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]. Then for sufficiently small &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a ''T''-periodic hyperbolic solution. The stable and unstable manifolds of this periodic solution intersect transversally. The distance between these manifolds measured along a direction that is perpendicular to the unperturbed  homoclinc orbit &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Melnikov distance'''. If &lt;math&gt;d(t)&lt;/math&gt;
denotes this distance, then &lt;math&gt;d(t) = \epsilon (M(t) + O(\epsilon))&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;M(t)&lt;/math&gt; is called the Melnikov function.

Melnikov’s distance can be used to predict chaotic vibrations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alemansour|first1=Hamed|last2=Miandoab|first2=Ehsan Maani|last3=Pishkenari|first3=Hossein Nejat|title=Effect of size on the chaotic behavior of nano resonators|journal=Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation|date=March 2017|volume=44|pages=495–505|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570416303197}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this method, critical amplitude is found by setting the distance between homoclinic orbits and stable manifolds equal to zero. The Melnikov’s method provides necessary but not sufficient condition for chaos.

In mathematics, a '''minimal K-type''' is a representation of a maximal compact subgroup ''K'' of a [[semisimple Lie group]] ''G'' that is in some sense the smallest representation of ''K'' occurring in a [[Harish-Chandra module]] of ''G''. Minimal K-types were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Vogan|authorlink=David Vogan|year=1979}} as part of an algebraic description of the [[Langlands classification]].

'''Multi-index notation''' is a [[mathematical notation]] that simplifies formulas used in [[multivariable calculus]], [[partial differential equation]]s and the theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s, by generalising the concept of an integer [[index notation|index]] to an ordered [[tuple]] of indices.

==Definition and basic properties==

An ''n''-dimensional '''multi-index''' is an ''n''-[[tuple]]

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;

of [[natural number|non-negative integers]] (i.e. an element of the ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[natural number]]s, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^n_0&lt;/math&gt;).

For multi-indices &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{N}^n_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; one defines:

;Componentwise sum and difference
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \pm \beta= (\alpha_1 \pm \beta_1,\,\alpha_2 \pm \beta_2, \ldots, \,\alpha_n \pm \beta_n)&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Partial order]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \le \beta \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \alpha_i \le \beta_i \quad \forall\,i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;

;Sum of components (absolute value) 
:&lt;math&gt;| \alpha | = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \cdots + \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Factorial]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha ! = \alpha_1! \cdot \alpha_2! \cdots \alpha_n!&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Binomial coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{\alpha}{\beta} = \binom{\alpha_1}{\beta_1}\binom{\alpha_2}{\beta_2}\cdots\binom{\alpha_n}{\beta_n} = \frac{\alpha!}{\beta!(\alpha-\beta)!}&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Multinomial coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{k}{\alpha} = \frac{k!}{\alpha_1! \alpha_2! \cdots \alpha_n! } = \frac{k!}{\alpha!} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k:=|\alpha|\in\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt;.

;[[Power (mathematics)|Power]]
:&lt;math&gt;x^\alpha = x_1^{\alpha_1} x_2^{\alpha_2} \ldots x_n^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Higher-order [[partial derivative]]

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\alpha = \partial_1^{\alpha_1} \partial_2^{\alpha_2} \ldots \partial_n^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\partial_i^{\alpha_i}:=\partial^{\alpha_i} / \partial x_i^{\alpha_i}&lt;/math&gt; (see also [[4-gradient]]).

==Some applications==
The multi-index notation allows the extension of many formulae from elementary calculus to the corresponding multi-variable case. Below are some examples. In all the following, &lt;math&gt;x,y,h\in\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\nu\in\mathbb{N}_0^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f,g,a_\alpha\colon\mathbb{C}^n\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;).

;[[Multinomial theorem]]

:&lt;math&gt; \biggl( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\biggr)^k = \sum_{|\alpha|=k} \binom{k}{\alpha} \, x^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Multi-binomial theorem]]

:&lt;math&gt; (x+y)^\alpha = \sum_{\nu \le \alpha} \binom{\alpha}{\nu} \, x^\nu y^{\alpha - \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, since {{math|''x''+''y''}} is a vector and {{math|''α''}} is a multi-index, the expression on the left is short for {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;...(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;+''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

;[[Leibniz rule (generalized product rule)|Leibniz formula]]
For smooth functions ''f'' and ''g''

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\alpha(fg) = \sum_{\nu \le \alpha} \binom{\alpha}{\nu} \, \partial^{\nu}f\,\partial^{\alpha-\nu}g.&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Taylor series]]
For an [[analytic function]] ''f'' in ''n'' variables one has

:&lt;math&gt;f(x+h) = \sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^n_0}^{}{\frac{\partial^{\alpha}f(x)}{\alpha !}h^\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, for a smooth enough function, we have the similar '''Taylor expansion'''
:&lt;math&gt;f(x+h) = \sum_{|\alpha| \le n}{\frac{\partial^{\alpha}f(x)}{\alpha !}h^\alpha}+R_{n}(x,h),&lt;/math&gt;
where the last term (the remainder) depends on the exact version of Taylor's formula. For instance, for the Cauchy formula (with integral remainder), one gets 
:&lt;math&gt;R_n(x,h)= (n+1) \sum_{|\alpha| =n+1}\frac{h^\alpha}{\alpha !}\int_0^1(1-t)^n\partial^\alpha f(x+th)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

;General linear [[partial differential operator]]
A formal linear ''N''-th order partial differential operator in ''n'' variables is written as

:&lt;math&gt;P(\partial) = \sum_{|\alpha| \le N}{}{a_{\alpha}(x)\partial^{\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Integration by parts]]
For smooth functions with [[compact support]] in a bounded domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; one has

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Omega}{}{u(\partial^{\alpha}v)}\,dx = (-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_{\Omega}^{}{(\partial^{\alpha}u)v\,dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is used for the definition of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s and [[weak derivative]]s.

==An example theorem==
If &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{N}^n_0&lt;/math&gt; are multi-indices and &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; \partial^\alpha x^\beta = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{\beta!}{(\beta-\alpha)!} x^{\beta-\alpha} &amp; \hbox{if}\,\, \alpha\le\beta,\\
 0 &amp; \hbox{otherwise.} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
The proof follows from the [[power rule]] for the [[differential calculus|ordinary derivative]]; if ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;'' are in {0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.}, then

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^\alpha}{dx^\alpha} x^\beta = \begin{cases} \frac{\beta!}{(\beta-\alpha)!} x^{\beta-\alpha} &amp; \hbox{if}\,\, \alpha\le\beta, \\ 0 &amp; \hbox{otherwise.} \end{cases}\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots, \alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta=(\beta_1,\ldots, \beta_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\partial^\alpha x^\beta&amp;= \frac{\partial^{\vert\alpha\vert}}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} x_1^{\beta_1} \cdots x_n^{\beta_n}\\
&amp;= \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1}} x_1^{\beta_1} \cdots
\frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{\partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} x_n^{\beta_n}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For each ''i'' in {1,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.,&amp;nbsp;''n''}, the function &lt;math&gt;x_i^{\beta_i}&lt;/math&gt; only depends on &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. In the above, each partial differentiation &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial x_i&lt;/math&gt; therefore reduces to the corresponding ordinary differentiation &lt;math&gt;d/dx_i&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, from equation (1), it follows that &lt;math&gt;\partial^\alpha x^\beta&lt;/math&gt; vanishes if ''&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for at least one ''i'' in {1,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.,&amp;nbsp;''n''}. If this is not the case, i.e., if ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;'' as multi-indices, then

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^{\alpha_i}}{dx_i^{\alpha_i}} x_i^{\beta_i} = \frac{\beta_i!}{(\beta_i-\alpha_i)!} x_i^{\beta_i-\alpha_i}&lt;/math&gt;
for each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and the theorem follows. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematical folklore]], the '''"no free lunch" (NFL) theorem''' (sometimes pluralized) of [[David Wolpert]] and [[William G. Macready|William Macready]] appears in the 1997 "No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization".&lt;ref name=WM97&gt;Wolpert, D.H., Macready, W.G. (1997), "[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization]", ''IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'' '''1''', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for [[machine learning]] (statistical inference).&lt;ref name=Wolpert96&gt;Wolpert, David (1996), "[http://www.zabaras.com/Courses/BayesianComputing/Papers/lack_of_a_priori_distinctions_wolpert.pdf The Lack of ''A Priori'' Distinctions between Learning Algorithms]", ''Neural Computation'', pp. 1341-1390.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220125415/http://www.zabaras.com/Courses/BayesianComputing/Papers/lack_of_a_priori_distinctions_wolpert.pdf |date=2016-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Wolpert and Macready themselves indicated that the first theorem in their paper "state[s] that any two [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems".&lt;ref name=WM-coev&gt;Wolpert, D.H., and Macready, W.G. (2005) "Coevolutionary free lunches", ''IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'', 9(6): 721-735&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 theorems of Wolpert and Macready are mathematically technical.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The folkloric{{clarify|reason=article doesn't specifically say what the folkloric version is|date=May 2018}} "no free lunch" (NFL) theorem is an easily stated and easily understood consequence of theorems Wolpert and Macready actually prove. It is weaker than the proven theorems, and thus does not encapsulate them. Various investigators have extended the work of Wolpert and Macready substantively. See [[No free lunch in search and optimization]] for treatment of the research area.

While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research.&lt;ref name=whitley&gt;Whitley, Darrell, and Jean Paul Watson.

==Example==
To find the highest point on Earth, Alice uses a steepest-ascent local search which restarts when a local peak is fully climbed. Bob uses a steepest-descent local search which restarts when it bottoms out at a local trough. In our Earth, Alice will find the highest point much faster than Bob will. However, in some ensembles, each world such as ours can be paired 1-to-1 with a hypothetical "Bobworld" which is identical to ours, except that the elevation of peak of Mount Everest and of the lowest point in the Marianas Trench are swapped, as if a tall pole has been stuck in the Trench. In Bobworld, Bob's strategy of descending outperforms Alice's strategy of climbing; in fact, given further 1-to-1 pairing assumptions that are reasonable in a universe of bounded size, neither Alice's strategy nor Bob's strategy performs better on average, in the absence of some systematic natural bias towards worlds like Earth and away from worlds like Bobworld.&lt;ref name=whitley/&gt;

==Original NFL theorems==
Wolpert and Macready give two NFL theorems that are closely related to the folkloric theorem. In their paper, they state:

{{quote|We have dubbed the associated results NFL theorems because they demonstrate that if an algorithm performs well on a certain class of problems then it necessarily pays for that with degraded performance on the set of all remaining problems.&lt;ref name="WM97" /&gt; }}

The first theorem hypothesizes [[objective function]]s that do not change while optimization is in progress, and the second hypothesizes objective functions that may change.&lt;ref name="WM97" /&gt;

{{block indent|''Theorem 1'': For any algorithms ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at iteration step ''m''
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\sum_f P(d_m^y | f, m, a_1) = \sum_f P(d_m^y | f, m, a_2),&lt;/math&gt;}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;d_m^y&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ordered set of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of the cost values &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; associated to input values &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt; is the function being optimized and &lt;math&gt;P(d_m^y | f, m, a)&lt;/math&gt; is the conditional probability of obtaining a given sequence of cost values from algorithm &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; run &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times on function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem can be equivalently formulated as follows:

{{block indent|''Theorem 1'': Given a finite set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and a finite set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers, assume that &lt;math&gt;f : V \to S&lt;/math&gt; is chosen at random according to uniform distribution on the set &lt;math&gt;S^V&lt;/math&gt; of all possible functions from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. For the problem of optimizing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over the set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, then no algorithm performs better than blind search.}}

Here, ''blind search'' means that at each step of the algorithm, the element &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; is chosen at random with uniform probability distribution from the elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; that have not been chosen previously.

In essence, this says that when all functions ''f'' are equally likely, the probability of observing an arbitrary sequence of ''m'' values in the course of optimization does not depend upon the algorithm. In the analytic framework of Wolpert and Macready, performance is a function of the sequence of observed values (and not e.g. of wall-clock time), so it follows easily that all algorithms have identically distributed performance when objective functions are drawn uniformly at random, and also that all algorithms have identical mean performance. But identical mean performance of all algorithms does not imply Theorem 1, and thus the folkloric theorem is not equivalent to the original theorem.

Theorem 2 establishes a similar, but "more subtle", NFL result for time-varying objective functions.&lt;ref name=WM97/&gt;

==Motivation==
The NFL theorems were explicitly ''not'' motivated by the question of what can be inferred (in the case of NFL for machine learning) or found (in the case of NFL for search) when the "environment is uniform random". Rather uniform randomness was used as a tool, to compare the number of environments for which algorithm A outperforms algorithm B to the number of environments for which B outperforms A. NFL tells us that (appropriately weighted){{clarify|date=May 2018}} there are just as many environments in both of those sets.

This is true for many definitions of what precisely an "environment" is. In particular, there are just as many prior distributions (appropriately weighted) in which learning algorithm A beats B (on average) as vice versa.{{citation needed|reason=dubious; the set of possible prior distributions is infinite|date=May 2018}} This statement about ''sets of priors'' is what is most important about NFL, not the fact that any two algorithms perform equally for the single, specific prior distribution that assigns equal probability to all environments.

While the NFL is important to understand the fundamental limitation for a set of problems, it does not state anything about each particular instance of a problem that can arise in practice. That is, the NFL states what the NFL states in the mathematical statements and it is nothing more than that. For example, it applies to the situations where the algorithm is fixed first and a nature can choose a worst problem instance to each fixed algorithm. Therefore, if we have a "good" problem in practice or if we can choose a "good" learning algorithm for a given particular problem instance, then the NFL does not mention any limitation about this particular problem instance. See for example.&lt;ref name=KA-deep&gt;Kawaguchi, K., Kaelbling, L.P, and Bengio, Y.(2017) "Generalization in deep learning", https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05468&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the results of the NFL along with "seemingly" contradicting results from other papers, it is important to actually understand the mathematical logic of the NFL instead of intuitive notation of the NFL. All results including the NFL and&lt;ref name="KA-deep"/&gt; are indeed consistent.

==Implications for computing and for the scientific method==
{{Further|Problem of induction}}
To illustrate one of the counter-intuitive implications of NFL, suppose we fix two supervised learning algorithms, C and D. We then sample a target function f to produce a set of input-output pairs, ''d''. How should we choose whether to train C or D on ''d'', in order to make predictions for what output would be associated with a point lying outside of ''d?''

It is common in almost of all science and statistics to answer this question  - to choose between C and D -  by running cross-validation on ''d'' with those two algorithms. In other words, to decide whether to generalize from ''d'' with either C or D'','' we see which of them has better out-of-sample performance when tested within ''d''.

Note that since C and D are fixed, this use of cross-validation to choose between them is itself an algorithm, i.e., a way of generalizing from an arbitrary dataset. Call this algorithm A. (Arguably, A is a simplified model of the scientific method itself.)

Note as well though that we could also use ''anti''-cross-validation to make our choice. In other words, we could choose between C and D based on which has ''worse'' out-of-sample performance within ''d''. Again, since C and D are fixed, this use of anti-cross-validation is itself an algorithm. Call that algorithm B.

NFL tells us (loosely speaking) that B must beat A on just as many target functions (and associated datasets ''d'') as A beats B. In this very specific sense, the scientific method will lose to the "anti" scientific method just as readily as it wins.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, D.H. (2013) "What the no free lunch theorems really mean", Ubiquity, Volume 2013, December 2013, DOI: 10.1145/2555235.2555237&lt;/ref&gt;

However, note that NFL only applies if the target function is chosen from a uniform distribution of all possible functions. If this is not the case, and certain target functions are more likely to be chosen than others, then A may perform better than B overall. The contribution of NFL is that it tells us choosing an appropriate algorithm requires making assumptions about the kinds of target functions the algorithm is being used for. With no assumptions, no "meta-algorithm", such as the scientific method, performs better than random choice.

While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research.&lt;ref name=whitley/&gt;&lt;ref name=carrier/&gt; If [[Occam's razor]] is correct, for example if sequences of lower [[Kolmogorov complexity]] are more probable than sequences of higher complexity, then (as is observed in real life) some algorithms, such as cross-validation, perform better on average on practical problems (when compared with random choice or with anti-cross-validation).&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore, Tor, and Marcus Hutter. "[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.3846 No free lunch versus Occam’s razor in supervised learning]." In Algorithmic Probability and Friends. Bayesian Prediction and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 223-235. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1944">In [[mathematics]], the '''normal form''' of a [[dynamical system]] is a simplified form that can be useful in determining the system's behavior.

Normal forms are often used for determining local [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]] in a system. All systems exhibiting a certain type of bifurcation are locally (around the equilibrium) [[topological conjugacy|topologically equivalent]] to the normal form of the bifurcation. For example, the normal form of a [[saddle-node bifurcation]] is &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mu + x^2 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is the bifurcation parameter. The transcritical bifurcation &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = r \ln x + x - 1 &lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt; x=1 &lt;/math&gt; can be converted to the normal form &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mu u - u^2 + O(u^3) &lt;/math&gt; with the transformation &lt;math&gt; u = x -1, \mu = r + 1 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="strogatz"&gt;Strogatz, Steven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2341">A '''quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra''' is a specialized form of a [[quasi-Hopf algebra]] defined by the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] mathematician [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] in 1989. It is also a generalized form of a [[quasi-triangular Hopf algebra]].

A '''quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra''' is a set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H_A} = (\mathcal{A}, R, \Delta, \varepsilon, \Phi) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B_A} = (\mathcal{A}, \Delta, \varepsilon, \Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quasi-Hopf algebra]] and &lt;math&gt;R \in \mathcal{A \otimes A} &lt;/math&gt; known as the R-matrix, is an invertible element such that 

:&lt;math&gt; R \Delta(a) = \sigma \circ \Delta(a) R, a \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma: \mathcal{A \otimes A} \rightarrow \mathcal{A \otimes A} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x \otimes y \rightarrow y \otimes x &lt;/math&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the switch map and

:&lt;math&gt; (\Delta \otimes \operatorname{id})R = \Phi_{321}R_{13}\Phi_{132}^{-1}R_{23}\Phi_{123} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (\operatorname{id} \otimes \Delta)R = \Phi_{231}^{-1}R_{13}\Phi_{213}R_{12}\Phi_{123}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{abc} = x_a \otimes x_b \otimes x_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Phi_{123}= \Phi = x_1 \otimes x_2 \otimes x_3 \in \mathcal{A \otimes A \otimes A}&lt;/math&gt;.

The quasi-Hopf algebra becomes ''triangular'' if in addition, &lt;math&gt;R_{21}R_{12}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

The twisting of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H_A}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;F \in \mathcal{A \otimes A}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as for a quasi-Hopf algebra, with the additional definition of the twisted ''R''-matrix

A quasi-triangular (resp. triangular) quasi-Hopf algebra with &lt;math&gt; \Phi=1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quasi-triangular Hopf algebra|quasi-triangular (resp. triangular) Hopf algebra]] as the latter two conditions in the definition reduce the conditions of quasi-triangularity of a Hopf algebra.

Similarly to the [[quasi-bialgebra#Twisting|twisting]] properties of the [[quasi-Hopf algebra]], the property of being quasi-triangular or triangular quasi-Hopf algebra is preserved by twisting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4333">In [[mathematic]]s and [[political science]], the '''quota rule''' states that when proportionally [[Apportionment (politics)|apportioning seats]], the number of representative seats that should be alloted to a given party should be no more than the upper or lower roundings (called upper and lower quotas) of the [[proportional representation]];&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/apportioning-representatives-in-the-united-states-congress-the-quota-rule Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; i.e if a party deserves 10.56 seats out of 15, the quota rule states that when the seats are alloted, the party may get 10 or 11 seats, but not lower or higher. The use of this rule is important when allocating seats in places such as the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and any place that uses proportional representation.

==Mathematics==
The rule can be rigorously defined as follows: Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be the population of the party, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be the total population, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be the number of available seats. The quota for that party is then

: &lt;math&gt; \frac P T \cdot S&lt;/math&gt;

When the quota results in a fractional value, the lower quota is the quota rounded down and the upper quota is the quota rounded up. Hence, the quota rule states that the only allocation for that party should be either the lower or upper quota.&lt;ref name="maa"/&gt; If at any time an allocation gives a party a greater or lesser number of seats than the upper or lower quota, that allocation (and by extension, the method used to allocate it) is said to be in violation of the quota rule.

===Relation to other apportionment paradoxes===
The [[Apportionment_paradox#Balinski–Young_theorem|Balinski–Young theorem]] proved in 1980 that if an apportionment method satisfies the quota rule, it must fail to satisfy some other [[apportionment paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~bosikiew/Math11008/imposs-apportion.pdf Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although [[Largest remainder method|Hamilton's method]] satisfies the quota rule, it violates the [[Alabama paradox]] and the [[population paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;https://rangevoting.org/Apportion.html Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem itself is broken up into several different proofs that cover a wide number of circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"&gt;http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/1338/1/WP-80-131.pdf Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, there are two main statements that apply to the quota rule:
*Any method that follows the quota rule must fail the population paradox.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;
*Any method that is free of both the Alabama paradox and the population paradox must necessarily fail the quota rule for some circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;

==Use in apportionment methods==
Different methods for allocating seats may or may not satisfy the quota rule. For example, Hamilton's method proportions seats equally until a fractional value is reached; the surplus seats are then given to the state with the largest fractional parts until there are no more surplus seats. Hamilton's method will always pass the quota rule, as there is no period in which a state can be allotted more than the upper quota or less than the lower quota.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.math.colostate.edu/~freeman/m130/apportionment1.pdf Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abax from Darius Vase.jpg|thumb|Abax depicted on the [[Darius Vase]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Michael R.|title=A history of computing technology|year=1998|publisher=IEEE Computer Soc.|location=Los Alamitos, Calif.|isbn=978-0-8186-7739-7|page=56|edition=2nd ed., 2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

A '''sand table''' uses constrained sand for modelling or educational purposes. The original version of a sand table may be the abax used by early Greek students. In the modern era, one common use for a sand table is to make terrain models for [[military plan]]ning and [[wargaming]].

==Abax==
An abax was a table covered with sand commonly used by students, particularly in Greece, to perform studies such as writing, geometry, and calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1958:177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

An abax was the predecessor to the [[abacus]]. Objects, such as stones, were added for counting and then columns for place-valued arithmetic. The demarcation between an abax and an abacus seems to be poorly defined in history;&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah 2000:125–126 and others&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, modern definitions of the word ''abacus'' universally describe it as a frame with rods and beads&lt;ref&gt;See American Heritage definition of "abacus" in External Links below&lt;/ref&gt; and, in general, do not include the definition of "sand table".

The sand table may well have been the predecessor to some [[board games]]. ("The word abax, or abacus, is used both for the reckoning-board with its counters and the play-board with its pieces, ...").&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1879:28&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abax'' is from the [[Old Greek#Evolution from Ancient to Modern Greek|old Greek]] for "sand table".&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage:abacus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghubar==
An Arabic word for sand (or dust) is ''ghubar'' (or ''gubar''), and Western numerals (the [[decimal]] digits 0&amp;ndash;9) are derived from the style of digits written on ''ghubar'' tables in North-West Africa and Iberia, also described as the 'West Arabic' or 'gubar' style.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. J.,  and E. F. Robertson, ''The Arabic numeral system http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
[[File:Marine table2.gif|thumb|Marines view a sand table model  of the operating area of [[Exercise Desert Punch]] constructed on the desert floor near [[Yuma, Arizona]].]]
Sand tables have been used for [[military plan]]ning and [[wargaming]] for many years as a field expedient, [[Scale (map)|small-scale map]], and in [[Military training|training]] for [[Battle|military actions]]. In 1890 a Sand table room was built at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] for use in teaching cadets military tactics; this replaced the old sand table room in a pre-college building, in which the weight of the sand had damaged the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Preston `Canada`s RMC: A History of the Royal Military College` (University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sand tables increasingly fell out of favour with improved maps, aerial and satellite photography, and later, with digital terrain simulations. More modern sand tables have incorporated [[Augmented reality|Augmented Reality]], such as the [[Augmented Reality Sandtable (ARES)]] developed by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/yp5w8y/the-armys-new-projection-mapped-sandtable|title=Design Digital Terrain with the Army's Projection-Mapped Sandtable|last=Mufson|first=Beckett|date=November 5, 2014|work=Vice Creators|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, virtual and conventional sand tables are used in operations training.

In 1991, "Special Forces teams discovered an elaborate sand-table model of the Iraqi military plan for the defense of Kuwait City. Four huge red arrows from the sea pointed at the coastline of Kuwait City and the huge defensive effort positioned there. Small fences of concertina wire marked the shoreline and models of artillery pieces lined the shore area.

[[Image:KsiegaSzkocka1.JPG|thumb|Part of the Scottish Book with [[Stefan Banach|Banach's]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam's]] notes.]]
The '''Scottish Café''' ({{lang-pl|Kawiarnia Szkocka}}) was the café in [[Lviv|Lwów]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (now Lviv, [[Ukraine]]) where, in the 1930s and 1940s, &lt;!-- [[Poland|Polish]] --&gt; [[Lwów School of Mathematics|mathematicians from the Lwów School]] collaboratively discussed [[mathematical problem|research problem]]s, particularly in [[functional analysis]] and [[general topology|topology]].

[[Stanislaw Ulam]] recounts that the tables of the café had [[marble]] tops, so they could write in pencil, directly on the table, during their discussions. To keep the results from being lost, and after becoming annoyed with their writing directly on the table tops, [[Stefan Banach]]'s wife provided the mathematicians with a large notebook, which was used for writing the problems and answers and eventually became known as the ''[[Scottish Book]]''. The book—a collection of solved, unsolved, and even probably unsolvable problems—could be borrowed by any of the guests of the café. Solving any of the problems was rewarded with prizes, with the most difficult and challenging problems having expensive prizes (during the [[Great Depression]] and on the eve of [[World War II]]), such as a bottle of fine brandy.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

For problem 153, which was later recognized as being closely related to Stefan Banach's "[[approximation problem|basis problem]]", [[Stanisław Mazur]] offered the prize of a live goose. This problem was solved only in 1972 by [[Per Enflo]], who was presented with the live goose in a ceremony that was broadcast throughout Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin, ed.; Kaluza.&lt;/ref&gt;

The café building now houses the Szkotcka Restaurant &amp; Bar (named for the original Scottish Café) and the Atlas Deluxe hotel at the street address of 27 [[Taras Shevchenko]] Prospekt.

In [[mathematics]], a '''smooth maximum''' of an [[indexed family]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of numbers is a [[smooth approximation]] to the [[maximum]] function &lt;math&gt;\max(x_1,\ldots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt; meaning a [[parametric family]] of functions &lt;math&gt;m_\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that for every {{mvar|''α''}}, the function {{tmath|m_\alpha}} is smooth, and the family converges to the maximum function {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \max}} as {{tmath|\alpha\to\infty}}. The concept of '''smooth minimum''' is similarly defined. In many cases, a single family approximates both: maximum as the parameter goes to positive infinity, minimum as the parameter goes to negative infinity; in symbols, {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \max}} as {{tmath|\alpha \to \infty}} and {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \min}} as {{tmath|\alpha \to -\infty}}. The term can also be used loosely for a specific smooth function that behaves similarly to a maximum, without necessarily being part of a parametrized family.

== Examples ==
For large positive values of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the following formulation is one smooth, [[differential (calculus)|differentiable]] approximation of the maximum function.  For negative values of the parameter that are large in absolute value, it approximates the minimum.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i e^{\alpha x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n e^{\alpha x_i}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has the following properties:
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to \max&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[arithmetic mean]] of its inputs
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to \min&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\to -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to [[softmax function|softmax]] and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_{x_i}\mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{e^{\alpha x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\alpha x_j}} [1 + \alpha(x_i - \mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n))].
&lt;/math&gt;

This makes the softmax function useful for optimization techniques that use [[gradient descent]].

=== LogSumExp ===
{{main|LogSumExp}}
Another smooth maximum is [[LogSumExp]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{LSE}(x_1, \ldots,  x_n) = \log( \exp(x_1) + \ldots + \exp(x_n))
&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be normalized if the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are all non-negative, yielding a function with domain &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)^n&lt;/math&gt; and range &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
g(x_1, \ldots,  x_n) = \log( \exp(x_1) + \ldots + \exp(x_n) - (n - 1) )
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; term corrects for the fact that &lt;math&gt;\exp(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; by canceling out all but one zero exponential, and &lt;math&gt;\log 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; if all &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are zero.

In [[mathematics]], '''summation''' (denoted with an enlarged capital Greek [[sigma]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum&lt;/math&gt;) is the [[addition]] of a [[sequence]] of numbers; the result is their ''sum'' or ''total''. If numbers are added sequentially from left to right, any intermediate result is a [[partial sum]], [[prefix sum]], or [[running total]] of the summation.

The numbers to be summed (called ''addends'', or sometimes ''summands'') may be integers, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s, or [[complex number]]s. Besides numbers, other types of values can be added as well: [[vector space|vectors]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[polynomial]]s and, in general, elements of any [[Additive group|additive group]] (or even [[monoid]]).

For finite sequences of such elements, summation always produces a well-defined sum. The summation of an infinite sequence of values is called a [[series (mathematics)|series]]. A value of such a series may often be defined by means of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (although sometimes the value may be infinite, and often no value results at all). Another notion involving limits of finite sums is [[integral|integration]].

The summation of the sequence &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1, 2, 4, 2&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] whose value is the sum of each of the members of the sequence. In the example, {{nowrap|1 + 2 + 4 + 2}} = 9. Because addition is [[associative]], the sum does not depend on how the additions are grouped, for instance {{nowrap|(1 + 2) + (4 + 2)}} and {{nowrap|1 + ((2 + 4) + 2)}} both have the value&amp;nbsp;9; therefore, parentheses are usually omitted in repeated additions. Addition is also [[commutative]], so [[permutation|permuting]] the terms of a finite sequence does not change its sum. For infinite summations this property may fail. See [[Absolute convergence]] for conditions under which it still holds.

There is no special notation for the summation of such explicit sequences, as the corresponding repeated addition expression will do. There is only a slight difficulty if the sequence has fewer than two elements: the summation of a sequence of one term involves no plus sign (it is indistinguishable from the term itself) and the summation of the empty sequence cannot even be written down (but one can write its value "0" in its place). If, however, the terms of the sequence are given by a regular pattern, possibly of variable length, then a summation operator may be useful or even essential.

For the summation of the sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to 100, one could use an addition expression involving an [[ellipsis]] to indicate the missing terms: {{nowrap|1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 99 + 100}}. In this case, the reader can easily guess the pattern. However, for more complicated patterns, one needs to be precise about the rule used to find successive terms, which can be achieved by using the summation operator "[[sigma|Σ]]". Using this sigma notation the above summation is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \mathop =1}^{100}i.&lt;/math&gt;

The value of this summation is 5050. It can be found without performing 99 additions, since it can be shown (for instance by [[mathematical induction]]) that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{ i \mathop =1}^ni = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for all [[natural number]]s ''n''.{{efn|For details, see [[Triangular number]].}} More generally, formulae exist for many summations of terms following a regular pattern.

The term "[[indefinite sum]]mation" refers to the search for an [[inverse image]] of a given infinite sequence ''s'' of values for the forward [[difference operator]], in other words for a sequence, called antidifference of ''s'', whose [[finite difference]]s are given by ''s''. By contrast, summation as discussed in this article is called "definite summation".

When it is necessary to clarify that numbers are added with their signs, the term '''algebraic sum'''&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed. - algebraic (esp. of a sum): taken with consideration of the sign (plus or minus) of each term.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2018}} is used. For example, in electric circuit theory [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] consider the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point, assigning opposite signs to currents flowing in and out of the node.

== Notation ==
=== Capital-sigma notation ===
[[File:Greek uc sigma.svg|thumb|74x74px|The summation symbol]]
Mathematical notation uses a symbol that compactly represents summation of many similar terms: the ''summation symbol'',  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum&lt;/math&gt;, an enlarged form of the upright capital Greek letter [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]]. This is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \mathop =m}^n a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2} +\cdots+ a_{n-1} + a_n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' represents the '''index of summation'''; ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an indexed variable representing each successive term in the series; ''m'' is the '''lower bound of summation''', and ''n'' is the '''upper bound of summation'''. The ''"i = m"'' under the summation symbol means that the index ''i'' starts out equal to ''m''.  The index, ''i'', is incremented by 1 for each successive term, stopping when ''i'' = ''n''.{{efn|For a detailed exposition on summation notation, and arithmetic with sums, see {{cite book|authors=Graham, Ronald L.; Knuth, Donald E.; Patashnik, Oren|chapter=Chapter 2: Sums|title=Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (2nd Edition)|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=1994|isbn=978-0201558029|url=http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vsevani/Concrete%20Mathematics%20-%20R.%20Graham,%20D.%20Knuth,%20O.%20Patashnik.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}}}

Here is an example showing the summation of squares:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i =3}^6 i^2 = 3^2+4^2+5^2+6^2 = 86.&lt;/math&gt;

Informal writing sometimes omits the definition of the index and bounds of summation when these are clear from context, as in:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum a_i^2 = \sum_{ i \mathop =1}^n a_i^2.&lt;/math&gt;

One often sees generalizations of this notation in which an arbitrary logical condition is supplied, and the sum is intended to be taken over all values satisfying the condition. Here are some common examples:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{0\le k&lt; 100} f(k)&lt;/math&gt;
is the sum of &lt;math&gt;f(k)&lt;/math&gt; over all (integers) &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in the specified range,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \mathop \in S} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is the sum of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; over all elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d|n}\;\mu(d)&lt;/math&gt;
is the sum of &lt;math&gt;\mu(d)&lt;/math&gt; over all positive integers &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dividing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.{{efn|Although the name of the [[Free variables and bound variables|dummy variable]] does not matter (by definition), one usually uses letters from the middle of the alphabet (&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;) to denote integers, if there is a risk of confusion. For example, even if there should be no doubt about the interpretation, it could look slightly confusing to many mathematicians to see &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in the above formulae involving &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. See also [[typographical conventions in mathematical formulae]].}}

There are also ways to generalize the use of many sigma signs. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;
is the same as
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}\sum_{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

A similar notation is applied when it comes to denoting the [[Multiplication#Capital Pi notation|product]] of a sequence, which is similar to its summation, but which uses the multiplication operation instead of addition (and gives 1 for an empty sequence instead of 0). The same basic structure is used, with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\prod&lt;/math&gt;, an enlarged form of the Greek capital letter [[Pi (letter)|Pi]], replacing the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum&lt;/math&gt;.

===Special cases===
It is possible to sum fewer than 2 numbers:
* If the summation has one summand &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then the evaluated sum is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
* If the summation has no summands, then the evaluated sum is [[0 (number)|zero]], because &lt;!-- huh?,  REFERENCE?? --&gt; zero is the [[identity element|identity]] for addition. This is known as the ''[[empty sum]]''.

These degenerate cases are usually only used when the summation notation gives a degenerate result in a special case.
For example, if &lt;math&gt;n=m&lt;/math&gt; in the definition above, then there is only one term in the sum; if &lt;math&gt;n=m-1&lt;/math&gt;, then there is none.

== Formal definition ==
Summation may be defined recursively as follows 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=a}^b g(i)=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, for ''b'' &lt; ''a''.
: 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=a}^b g(i)=g(b)+\sum_{i=a}^{b-1} g(i)&lt;/math&gt;, for ''b'' ≥ ''a''.

==Measure theory notation==
In the notation of [[measure theory|measure]] and [[integral|integration]] theory, a sum can be expressed as a [[definite integral]],

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k \mathop =a}^b f(k) = \int_{[a,b]} f\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of the [[integer]]s from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[counting measure]].

==Calculus of finite differences==

Given a function {{mvar|f}} that is defined over the integers in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''m'', ''n'']}}, one has
:&lt;math&gt;f(m)-f(n)= \sum_{i=m}^{n-1} (f(i+1)-f(i)).&lt;/math&gt;

This is the analogue in [[calculus of finite differences]] of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], which states
:&lt;math&gt;f(m)-f(n)=\int_m^n f'(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[derivative]] of {{mvar|f}}.

An example of application of the above equation is 
:&lt;math&gt;n^k=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left((i+1)^k-i^k\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Using [[binomial theorem]], this may be rewritten 
:&lt;math&gt;n^k=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \binom{k}{j} x^j\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The above formula is more commonly used for inverting of the [[difference operator]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(f)(n)=f(n+1)-f(n), &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|f}} is a function defined on the nonnegative integers.
Thus, given such a function {{mvar|f}}, the problem is to compute the [[antidifference]] of {{mvar|f}}, that is, a function &lt;math&gt;F=\Delta^{-1}f&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt;\Delta F=f,&lt;/math&gt;, that is,&lt;math&gt;F(n+1)-F(n)=f(n).&lt;/math&gt;
This function is defined up to the addition of a constant, and may be chosen as&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics'', Kenneth H. Rosen, John G. Michaels, CRC Press, 1999, {{isbn|0-8493-0149-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(n)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(i).&lt;/math&gt;

There is not always a [[closed-form expression]] for such a summation, but [[Faulhaber's formula]] provides a closed form in the case of &lt;math&gt;f(n)=n^k,&lt;/math&gt; and, by [[linearity]] for every [[polynomial function]] of {{mvar|n}}.

==Approximation by definite integrals==
Many such approximations can be obtained by the following connection between sums and [[integral]]s, which holds for any:

[[monotonic function|increasing]] function ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{s=a-1}^{b} f(s)\ ds \le \sum_{i=a}^{b} f(i) \le \int_{s=a}^{b+1} f(s)\ ds.&lt;/math&gt;

[[monotonic function|decreasing]] function ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{s=a}^{b+1} f(s)\ ds \le \sum_{i=a}^{b} f(i) \le \int_{s=a-1}^{b} f(s)\ ds.&lt;/math&gt;

For more general approximations, see the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]].

For summations in which the summand is given (or can be interpolated) by an [[Riemann integral|integrable]] function of the index, the summation can be interpreted as a [[Riemann sum]] occurring in the definition of the corresponding definite integral. One can therefore expect that for instance

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b-a}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f\left(a+i\frac{b-a}n\right) \approx \int_a^b f(x)\ dx,&lt;/math&gt;

since the right hand side is by definition the limit for &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; of the left hand side. However, for a given summation ''n'' is fixed, and little can be said about the error in the above approximation without additional assumptions about ''f'': it is clear that for wildly oscillating functions the Riemann sum can be arbitrarily far from the Riemann integral.

== Identities ==
The formulae below involve finite sums; for infinite summations or finite summations of expressions involving [[trigonometric function]]s or other [[transcendental function]]s, see [[list of mathematical series]].

=== General identities ===
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=s}^t C\cdot f(n) = C\cdot \sum_{n=s}^t f(n)&lt;/math&gt;, if {{math|''C''}} is independent of {{mvar|n}} ([[distributivity]])
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=s}^t f(n) \pm \sum_{n=s}^{t} g(n) = \sum_{n=s}^t \left(f(n) \pm g(n)\right)\quad&lt;/math&gt; ([[commutativity]] and [[associativity]])
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=s}^t f(n) = \sum_{n=s+p}^{t+p} f(n-p)\quad&lt;/math&gt; (indices shift)
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\in B} f(n) = \sum_{m\in A} f(\sigma(m))&lt;/math&gt;, for a [[bijection]] σ from a finite set ''A'' onto a  set ''B'' (indices change); this generalizes the preceding formula.
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=s}^t f(n) =\sum_{n=s}^j f(n) + \sum_{n=j+1}^t f(n)\quad&lt;/math&gt; (splitting a sum, using [[associativity]])
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=a}^{b}f(n)=\sum_{n=0}^{b}f(n)-\sum_{n=0}^{a-1}f(n)\quad&lt;/math&gt; (a variant of the preceding formula)
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=k_0}^{k_1}\sum_{j=l_0}^{l_1} a_{i,j} = \sum_{j=l_0}^{l_1}\sum_{i=k_0}^{k_1} a_{i,j}\quad&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity and associativity, again)
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k\le j \le i\le n} a_{i,j} = \sum_{i=k}^n\sum_{j=k}^i a_{i,j} = \sum_{j=k}^n\sum_{i=j}^n a_{i,j} =
\sum_{j=0}^{n-k}\sum_{i=k}^{n-j} a_{i+j,i}\quad&lt;/math&gt; (another application of commutativity and associativity)
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{2t+1} f(n) = \sum_{n=0}^t f(2n) + \sum_{n=0}^t f(2n+1)\quad&lt;/math&gt; (splitting a sum in its odd and even parts, and changing the indices)
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k\right) \left(\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k\right)=\sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^n a_ib_j \quad&lt;/math&gt; ([[distributivity]])
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=s}^m\sum_{j=t}^n {a_i}{c_j} = \left(\sum_{i=s}^m a_i\right) \cdot \sum_{j=t}^n c_j\quad&lt;/math&gt; (distributivity allows factorization, when one has a separate indexation)
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=s}^t \log f(n) = \log \prod_{n=s}^t f(n)\quad&lt;/math&gt; (the [[logarithm]] of a products the sum of the logarithms of the factors)
: &lt;math&gt;C^{\scriptstyle\sum_{n=s}^t f(n) } = \prod_{n=s}^t C^{f(n)}\quad&lt;/math&gt; (the [[exponentiation|exponential]] of a sum is the product of the exponential of the summands)

\end {align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Binomial coefficients and factorials ===
{{Main|Binomial coefficient#Sums of the binomial coefficients}}

There exist very many summation identities involving binomial coefficients (a whole chapter of ''[[Concrete Mathematics]]'' is devoted to just the basic techniques). Some of the most basic ones are the following.

====Involving the binomial theorem====
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i}a^{n-i} b^i=(a + b)^n,&lt;/math&gt; the [[binomial theorem]]
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} = 2^n,&lt;/math&gt; the special case where {{math|1=''a'' = ''b'' = 1}}
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i}p^i (1-p)^{n-i}=1&lt;/math&gt;, the special case where {{math|1=''p'' = ''a'' = 1 – ''b''}}, which, for &lt;math&gt;0 \le p \le 1,&lt;/math&gt; expresses the sum of the [[binomial distribution]]
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n} i{n \choose i} = n(2^{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt; the value at {{math|1=''a'' = ''b'' = 1}} of the [[derivative]] with respect to {{mvar|a}} of the binomial theorem
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{n \choose i}{i+1} = \frac{2^{n+1}-1}{n+1},&lt;/math&gt; the value at {{math|1=''a'' = ''b'' = 1}} of the [[antiderivative]] with respect to {{mvar|a}} of the binomial theorem

==== Involving permutation numbers====
In the following summations, &lt;math&gt;{}_{n}P_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[k-permutation|{{math|''k''}}-permutations of {{math|''n''}}]].
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n} {}_{i}P_{k}{n \choose i} = {}_{n}P_{k}(2^{n-k})&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n {}_{i+k}P_{k+1} = \sum_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=0}^k (i+j) = \frac{(n+k+1)!}{(n-1)!(k+2)}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n} i!\cdot{n \choose i} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} {}_{n}P_{i} = \lfloor n! \cdot e \rfloor, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}^+&lt;/math&gt;, where  and &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[floor function]].

====Others====
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{m} \left(\begin{array}{c} n+k\\n\\ \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c} n+m+1\\n+1\\ \end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=k}^{n} {i \choose k} = {n+1 \choose k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n i\cdot i! = (n+1)! - 1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n {m+i-1 \choose i} = {m+n \choose n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i}^2 = {2n \choose n}&lt;/math&gt;

===Harmonic numbers===

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} = H_n&lt;/math&gt; (that is the {{mvar|n}}th [[harmonic number]])
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i^k} = H^k_n&lt;/math&gt; (that is a [[Harmonic number#Generalized harmonic numbers|generalized harmonic number]])

==Growth rates==
The following are useful [[approximation]]s (using [[big O notation|theta notation]]):

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^c \in \Theta(n^{c+1})&lt;/math&gt; for real ''c'' greater than −1
: 
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} \in \Theta(\log_e n)&lt;/math&gt; (See [[Harmonic number]])
: 
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n c^i \in \Theta(c^n)&lt;/math&gt; for real ''c'' greater than 1
: 
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \log(i)^c \in \Theta(n \cdot \log(n)^{c})&lt;/math&gt; for [[non-negative]] real ''c''
: 
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \log(i)^c \cdot i^d \in \Theta(n^{d+1} \cdot \log(n)^{c})&lt;/math&gt; for non-negative real ''c'', ''d''
: 
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \log(i)^c \cdot i^d \cdot b^i \in \Theta (n^d \cdot \log(n)^c \cdot b^n)&lt;/math&gt; for non-negative real ''b'' &gt; 1, ''c'', ''d''

In [[mathematics]], the '''''Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie''''' ('''''SGA''''') was an influential seminar run by [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. It was a unique phenomenon of research and publication outside of the main [[mathematical journal]]s that ran from 1960 to 1969 at the [[IHÉS]] near Paris. (The name came from the small wood on the estate in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] where the IHÉS was located from 1962.) The seminar notes were eventually published in twelve volumes, all except one in the [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] Lecture Notes in Mathematics series.

==Style==

The material has a reputation of being hard to read for a number of reasons. More elementary or foundational parts were relegated to the [[Éléments de géométrie algébrique|EGA]] series of Grothendieck and [[Jean Dieudonné]], causing long strings of logical dependencies in the statements. The style is very abstract and makes heavy use of [[category theory]]. Moreover, an attempt was made to achieve maximally general statements, while assuming that the reader is aware of the motivations and concrete examples.

==First publication==

The original notes to SGA were published in [[fascicle (book)|fascicles]] by the IHÉS, most of which went through two or three revisions.  These were published as the seminar proceeded, beginning in the early 60's and continuing through most of the decade.  They can still be found in large math libraries, but distribution was limited.  In the late 60's and early 70's, the original seminar notes were comprehensively revised and rewritten to take into account later developments.  In addition, a new volume, SGA 4½,  was compiled by [[Pierre Deligne]] and published in 1977; it contains simplified and new results by Deligne within the scope of SGA4 as well as some material from SGA5, which had not yet appeared at that time.  The revised notes, except for SGA2, were published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]  in its ''Lecture Notes in Mathematics'' series.

After a dispute with Springer, Grothendieck refused the permission for reprints of the series. While these later revisions were more widely distributed than the original fascicles, they are still uncommon outside of libraries.

References to SGA typically mean the later, revised editions and not the original fascicles; some of the originals were labelled by capital letters, thus for example S.G.A.D. = SGA3 and S.G.A.A. = SGA4.

==Series titles==

The volumes of the SGA series are the following:

*SGA1 ''Revêtements étales et groupe fondamental, 1960–1961'' (Étale coverings and the fundamental group), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 224, 1971
*SGA2 ''Cohomologie locale des faisceaux cohérents et théorèmes de Lefschetz locaux et globaux, 1961–1962'' ([[Local cohomology]] of coherent sheaves and global and local [[Lefschetz theorem]]s), North Holland 1968
*SGA3 ''Schémas en groupes, 1962–1964'' ([[Group scheme]]s), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 151, 152 and 153, 1970
*SGA4 ''Théorie des topos et cohomologie étale des schémas, 1963–1964'' ([[Topos theory]] and [[étale cohomology]]), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 269, 270 and 305, 1972/3
*SGA4½ ''Cohomologie étale'' (Étale cohomology), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 569, 1977. SGA 4½ does not correspond to any of the actual seminars. It is a compilation by [[Pierre Deligne]] of some survey articles, new results within the scope of SGA4, and finally material from SGA5.
*SGA5 ''Cohomologie l-adique et fonctions L, 1965–1966'' (''l''-adic cohomology and [[L-function|''L''-functions]]), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 589, 1977
*SGA6 ''Théorie des intersections et théorème de Riemann-Roch, 1966–1967''  (Intersection theory and the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]]), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 225, 1971
*SGA7 ''Groupes de monodromie en géométrie algébrique, 1967–1969'' ([[Monodromy]] groups in algebraic geometry), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 288 and 340, 1972/3.
*SGA8 was never written. The occasional mentions of SGA8 usually refer to either chapter 8 of SGA1, or Berthelot's work on [[crystalline cohomology]] later published outside the SGA series.

== Re-publishing ''SGA'' ==

In the 1990s it became obvious that the lack of availability of the SGA was becoming more and more of a problem to researchers and graduate students in algebraic geometry: not only are the copies in book form too few for the growing number of researchers, but they are also difficult to read because of the way they are typeset (on an [[IBM Selectric typewriter|electric typewriter]], with mathematical formulae written by hand). Thus, under the impetus of various mathematicians from several countries, a project was formed of re-publishing SGA in a more widely available electronic format and using [[LaTeX]] for typesetting; also, various notes are to be added to correct for minor mistakes or obscurities.  The result should be published by the [[Société Mathématique de France]].  Legal permission to reprint the works was obtained from every author except Alexander Grothendieck himself, who could not be contacted; it was decided to proceed without his explicit agreement on the grounds that his refusal for the SGA to be re-published by Springer-Verlag was an objection against Springer and not one of principle.

As a first step, the entire work was scanned and made available on-line (see the [[#External links|links section below]]) by Frank Calegari, Jim Borger and William Stein.  The job of typesetting the text anew and proofreading it was then distributed among dozens of volunteers (most of them junior French mathematicians, because of the required fluency in French and knowledge of algebraic geometry), starting with SGA1 in late 2001.

The coordinating editor for the work on SGA1 was [[Bas Edixhoven]] from [[Universiteit Leiden|University of Leiden]] (at the time [[Université de Rennes I|University of Rennes]]): the first version was available on the [[arXiv.org e-print archive]] on June 20, 2002, and the proof-read version was uploaded on January 4, 2004, and later published in book form by the Société Mathématique de France.  Work on SGA2 was started in 2004 with [[Yves Laszlo]] as coordinating editor. The LaTeX source file is available on the [[arXiv.org e-print archive]]; SGA2 appeared in print in late 2005 by the Société Mathématique de France (see https://web.archive.org/web/20091130171320/http://smf.emath.fr/Publications/DocumentsMathematiques/).

Laszlo has also edited SGA4 and recently Philippe Gille and Patrick Polo have uploaded TeXed version of SGA3. In January 2010, however, Grothendieck requested that work cease on republishing SGA. In late 2014 work on republishing SGA resumed and it was restored to the Grothendieck circle site.

This article gives a table of some common [[Lie group]]s and their associated [[Lie algebra]]s.

The following are noted: the [[Topology|topological]] properties of the group ([[dimension]]; [[Connected space|connectedness]]; [[Compact space|compactness]]; the nature of the [[fundamental group]]; and whether or not they are [[simply connected]]) as well as on their algebraic properties ([[Abelian group|abelian]]; [[Simple group|simple]]; [[Semisimple group|semisimple]]).

For more examples of Lie groups and other related topics see the [[list of simple Lie groups]]; the [[Bianchi classification]] of groups of up to three dimensions; and the [[list of Lie group topics]].

== Real Lie groups and their algebras ==

Column legend
* '''Cpt''': Is this group ''G'' [[Compact space|compact]]? (Yes or No)
* '''&lt;math&gt;\pi_0&lt;/math&gt;''': Gives the [[group of components]] of ''G''. The order of the component group gives the number of [[connected space|connected components]]. The group is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if the component group is [[trivial group|trivial]] (denoted by 0).
* '''&lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt;''': Gives the [[fundamental group]] of ''G'' whenever ''G'' is connected. The group is [[simply connected]] if and only if the fundamental group is [[trivial group|trivial]] (denoted by 0).
* '''UC''': If ''G'' is not simply connected, gives the [[universal cover]] of ''G''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">[[Image:Halmos symbols.png|frame|right|Various forms of the end-of-proof symbol]]
The '''tombstone''', '''Halmos''', '''end of proof''', or '''Q.E.D.''' mark "∎" is used in [[mathematics]] to denote the end of a [[Mathematical proof|proof]], in place of the traditional abbreviation "Q.E.D."  for the Latin phrase "''[[Q.E.D.|quod erat demonstrandum]]''", "which was to be shown". In magazines, it is one of the various symbols used to indicate the end of an article.

In [[Unicode]], it is represented as character {{unichar|220E|End of Proof|html=}}. Its graphic form varies. It may be a hollow or filled rectangle or square.

In [[AMS-LaTeX]], the symbol is automatically appended at the end of a proof environment &lt;tt&gt;\begin{proof}&lt;/tt&gt; ... &lt;tt&gt;\end{proof}&lt;/tt&gt;. It can also be obtained from the commands &lt;tt&gt;\qedsymbol&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\qed&lt;/tt&gt; (the latter causes the symbol to be right aligned).

It is sometimes called a halmos after the mathematician [[Paul Halmos]], who first used it in mathematical context. He got the idea of using it from seeing it was being used to indicate the end of articles in [[magazine]]s. In his memoir ''I Want to Be a Mathematician'', he wrote the following:&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Halmos, ''I Want to Be a Mathematician: An Automathography'', 1985, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The symbol is definitely not my invention&amp;nbsp;— it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into mathematics. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like ▯, and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof. It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.}}

'''Veṇvāroha''' is a work in [[Sanskrit]] composed by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama|Mādhava (c.1350 – c.1425) of Sangamagrāma]]  the founder of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]]. It is a work in 74 verses describing methods for the computation of the true positions of the [[Moon]] at intervals of about half an hour for various days in an [[Moon cycle|anomalistic cycle]]. This work is an elaboration of an earlier and shorter work of Mādhava himself titled ''[[Sphuta-chandrapti|Sphutacandrāpti]]''.&lt;ref name="Pingree"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Edwin Pingree|title=Census of the exact sciences in Sanskrit|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|location=Philadelphia|date=1981|volume=4|pages=414 |isbn=0-87169-146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Veṇvāroha'' is the most popular astronomical work of Mādhava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Westen Cultures |publisher=Springer|date=1997|pages=522|chapter=Article by R.C. Gupta|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dated 1403 [[Common Era|CE]]. [[Achyuta Pisharati|Acyuta Piṣārati]] (1550–1621), another prominent [[mathematician]]/[[astronomer]] of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala school]], has composed a [[Malayalam]] [[Close reading|commentary]] on ''Veṇvāroha''.&lt;ref name="Pingree"/&gt; This astronomical treatise is of a type generally described as Karaṇa texts in [[India]]. Such works are characterized by the fact that they are compilations of [[algorithm|computational methods]] of [[astronomy|practical astronomy]]. The title ''Veṇvāroha'' literally means [[Bamboo]] Climbing and it is indicative of the computational procedure expounded in the text. The computational scheme is like climbing a bamboo tree, going up and up step by step at measured equal heights.

The novelty and ingenuity of the method attracted the attention of several of the followers of Mādhava and they composed similar texts thereby creating a genre of works in Indian mathematical tradition  collectively referred to as ‘veṇvāroha texts’. These include ''Drik-veṇvārohakriya'' of unknown authorship of epoch 1695 and ''Veṇvārohastaka'' of [[Puthumana Somayaji|Putuman Somāyaji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b5e_1.pdf|author=K.V. Sarma|title=A survey of source materials |publisher=Indian national Academy of Science|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the technical terminology of astronomy, the ingenuity introduced by Mādhava in ''Veṇvāroha'' can be explained thus: Mādhava has endeavored   to compute the true [[longitude]] of the Moon by making use of the true motions rather than the epicyclic astronomy of the [[Aryabhata]] tradition. He made  use of the anomalistic revolutions for computing the true positions of the [[Moon]] using the successive true daily velocity specified in ''[[Candravakyas|Candravākyas]]'' (Table of Moon-mnemonics) for easy memorization and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=K. Chandra Hari|title=Computation of the true moon by Madhava of Sangamagrama|journal=Indian Journal of History of Science|volume=38|issue=3|pages=251–253|url=http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/2000c4df_231.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316083104/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/2000c4df_231.pdf|archive-date=16 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veṇvāroha has been studied from a modern perspective and the process is explained using the properties of periodic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S.
