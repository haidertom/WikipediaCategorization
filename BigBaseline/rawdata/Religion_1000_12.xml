[[Image:JO200109337.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

The 2001 '''About-Picard law''' [abu pika:r] (named after French parliament members [[Nicolas About]] and [[Catherine Picard]]), a controversial piece of [[France|French]] legislation, broadly speaking, makes it possible to act against organisations (legal entities) when such organisations have become involved in certain crimes. The law, in its own words, aimed at movements deemed cultic (''mouvements sectaires'') that "undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms".  The law has caused controversy internationally, with some commentators alleging that it infringes [[religious freedom]] while proponents content it reinforces religious freedom.

==Background on Government and Religion in France ==
:{{Main|Status of religious freedom in France}}

[[Freedom of religion]] and [[separation of church and state]] have formed part of the French idea of the state since at least the [[French Revolution]] and in some ways long before, since the 16th century period of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. Separation of religion and state in France takes the form of ''[[laïcité]]'', by which political power avoids interference in the sphere of religious dogma, and religion avoids interference in public policies. The French understand "freedom of religion" primarily as the freedom of the individual to believe or not to believe what any religion teaches. Also, because of a long history of one single dominating church (the [[Catholic Church]]), the French state sees its duty less in protecting religion from state interference than in protecting the individual from interference by religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In the wake of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] murders and suicides, the [[French National Assembly|French Parliament]] established the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]] to investigate cults. In December 1995 the Commission delivered a report on cults which caused much controversy, some of it due to a list extracted from a report by the [[French National Police]] on purported cults.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp
&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission assimilated information and analysis from the French police secret service, the [[Direction centrale des renseignements généraux|Renseignements généraux]].)

Following the recommendations of the report, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] set up in 1996 the "Interministerial board of observation of sects", followed in 1998 by the "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Sects" ([[Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes|MILS]]). In 2002 the "Interministerial Monitoring Mission Against Sectarian Abuses" ([[MIVILUDES]]) replaced MILS.

Other action of the French government against potential abuses by cults resulted in the passing of the About-Picard law.

== The About-Picard law==

Commentators often refer to the Law 2001-504 of June 12, 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX9903887L    &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021114222634/http://religionandpolicy.org/show.php?p=1.1.105 approximate translation into English]&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as the About-Picard law, from the name of its ''[[rapporteur]]s'' (parliamentarians who report upon the draft law), [[French Senate|senator]] [[Nicolas About]] ([[Union pour la Démocratie Française|UDF]] center-right party)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senat.fr/rap/l99-131/l99-131.html
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French National Assembly|deputy]] [[Catherine Picard]] ([[French Socialist Party|PS]] center-left party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208022636/http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |archivedate=2005-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French parliament adopted the law with broad cross-party support under the government of center-right president [[Jacques Chirac]] and socialist prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]].

'''Article 223-15-2 of Penal code:'''&lt;br /&gt;(Act no. 2001-504 of 12 June 2001, article 10 Official Journal of 13 June 2001 ; Ordinance No. 2000-916 of 19 September 2000, article 3 Official Journal of 22 September 2000, into force 1 January 2002) 
       
« Fraudulently abusing the ignorance or state of weakness of a minor, or of a person whose particular vulnerability, due to age, sickness, infirmity, to a physical or psychological disability or to pregnancy, is apparent or known to the offender, or abusing a person in a state of physical or psychological dependency resulting from serious or repeated pressure or from techniques used to affect his judgement, in order to induce the minor or other person to act or abstain from acting in any way seriously harmful to him, is punished by three years' imprisonment and a fine of € 375,000.
Where the offence is committed by the legal or de facto manager of a group that carries out activities the aim or effect of which is to create, maintain or exploit the psychological or physical dependency of those who participate in them, the penalty is increased to five years' imprisonment and to a fine of € 750,000. »

The additional penalties that natural or legal persons may incur are mentioned in the following articles 223-15-3 and 4.

===Main points ===
Notable new points introduced by the law include:
* In the case of certain crimes, the law extends legal responsibility from individuals to organizations (corporations, associations, and other [[Juristic person|legal entities]]...).
* Courts can order the dissolution of organizations if they or their executives have been found guilty of these crimes.
 
The initial draft of the About-Picard law included the criminalization of "mental manipulation". Many organizations criticised this clause for its vagueness.  [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Élisabeth Guigou]] pushed for the removal of this clause, which the legislators excluded from the final version of the law. However, the law makes it a crime to defraud a person weakened by illness, old age, etc., but also of a person in a state of ''psychological or physical subjection resulting from grave or reiterated pressures or techniques able to alter judgement''.

=== Application of the law ===
There was one famous application of the law since its adoption: that of [[Arnaud Mussy]], leader of the tiny ''Néo-Phare'' (New Lighthouse) cult. Mussy, who claims that he is the [[Christ]], had announced imminent [[apocalypse]], resulting in the suicide of one of his followers and the attempted suicides of two others, who were severely wounded in 2001. The criminal court in Nantes sentenced him to three years in prison and 90,000 [[French Franc|FF]] damages in November 2004. It ruled that he had "abused fraudulently the state of ignorance and weakness of several persons in the state of bodily or mental dependence".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0506.htm#6a&lt;/ref&gt; A higher court in Rennes confirmed the sentence in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0507.htm#12
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Law ==
:''See [[Status of religious freedom in France]] for expressed concerns about other aspects of French policies with respect to minority religions.''

The French government, when challenged on issues of religious discrimination, states that it has no concern in any way with religious doctrine ''per se''. The government has taken the position that it will deal with the concrete consequences of cult affiliation, especially with respect to children. The government sees this as particularly important in the light of past abuse committed in some criminal cults, such as [[sexual slavery]] and [[mass suicide]].  According to government sources, none of the criteria listed in related government documents on sects discuss [[theology]]; they only focus on the actions and the methods of the groups.

Critics of the law see this as merely a semantic change &lt;!-- change from what? --&gt; and maintain that no empirical studies support claims of the use of techniques of coercive persuasion by NRMs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theology.homestead.com/Papers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions inside France ===
{{See also|Status of religious freedom in France#Complaints by minority religions and groups|l1=Status of religious freedom in France: Complaints by minority religions}}

The [[Bishop of Soissons]], [[Marcel Herriot]], defended the law on 25 June 2000 asserting it was necessary to protect by law persons, family, society and religions themselves from sects that are violating fundamental freedoms and human dignity.

Some groups claim that the Parliamentary Reports and the controversy surrounding the About-Picard law have created an unhealthy atmosphere, resulting in minority religious groups suffering from excessively strict, uneven, or even abusive discrimination in the application of other laws by local authorities. For example, the group ''Coordination des Associations et Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience'' (Co-ordination of Associations and Individuals for Freedom of Conscience) requested the repeal of the law, asserting laws should not specify groups as "sectarian" or "cultic" as, in a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coordiap.com/Gtemo01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] report has described this group as a partisan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219055614/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |archivedate=2005-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The umbrella association of French [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] sued the French government in the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] in case #53430/99, alleging that the publication of the parliamentary reports and the enactment of the About-Picard law infringed its civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=671525&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected the application.

In other cases (#53934/00), the Court affirmed that the publication of a Parliamentary Report disparaging to some groups did not constitute an infringement of human rights, even though these groups were not given a [[legal recourse]] for the removal of their name from the report.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=682416&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149
&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights activists dubbed the law "un délit d'opinion" (a thought crime).&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements by the Council of Europe ===

Forty different religious and human-rights groups submitted a petition to the [[Council of Europe]]'s Parliamentary Assembly. This petition led to a report (Report 9612 of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of Europe) containing an expert paper by Swiss professor Joseph Voyame, who concluded:
:''"On the basis of the foregoing, I conclude that the French Law of 12 June 2001 is not incompatible with the Council of Europe’s values."''
Voyame deduces that the law clearly responds to a need, that the measure of dissolution appears radical, but also effective and reliable, and that judicial guarantees surround it. He also discusses the title with its mentioning of "cultic groups", but comes to the conclusion that the uncertainty regarding the definition has little importance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The title is undeniably part of the [Act], but has no legislative authority in itself. Although it may be useful for the purposes of interpretation, it cannot be used in making a ruling that runs counter to a clear legal provision [...] As we will see, [Sections] 1, 19 and 20 of this [Act] identify the targeted incorporated organizations and groups with the greatest possible precision. It is these standard-setting texts that are decisive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report discussed several objections regarding the word "secte" (cult):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the word ‘sect’ has taken on an extremely pejorative connotation. In the eyes of the public, it stigmatises movements whose activities are dangerous either for their members or for society. Today, the world contains dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of groups both large and small, all with various beliefs and observances, which are not necessarily dangerous or prejudicial to freedom. It is true that among these groups are some which have committed criminal acts. Nevertheless, the existence of a few dangerous movements is not enough to condemn all the rest (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The act for the most part simply reiterates existing provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have just seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2002, the Council of Europe passed a resolution inviting the Government of France to reconsider the About-Picard Law and to clarify certain terms in the law. It referred, however, to the Recommendation 1412 (1999) on the illegal activities of sects, where it had concluded that it was ''"essential to ensure that the activities of groups, whatever religious, esoteric or spiritual description they adopted, were in keeping with the principles of democratic societies and, in particular, the provisions of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)."'' and it stated that ''"ultimately, should the case arise, it will be for the [[European Court of Human Rights]], and it alone, to say whether or not this law is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights."'' .

=== Reactions outside of France===
In an open letter dated June 2000 to Alain Vivien about religious freedom in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df= 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Rhodes]], Executive Director of the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]] (IHFHR), wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We question ourselves how such a law can claim to guarantee human rights when it goes against the rights of association, expression, religion and conscience; when it puts in danger the right of minorities and maintains prejudices that are so incompatible with the concept of tolerance intrinsic to that of human rights. France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which you propose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alain Vivien responded: "[The IHFHR] seems today to have passed into the hands of [[Scientology|Scientologists]] and perhaps other transnational organizations". [[Aaron Rhodes]] then acknowledged that the Moscow office of the IHFHR had received funding from the [[Church of Scientology]] to print a leaflet about religious freedom in Russia, and voiced his astonishment at the charge. Rhodes voiced his embarrassment: "[...]for you and your fellow French citizens by your recourse to methods of denunciations and insinuations that remind us of those sometimes used by totalitarian and backward regimes."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Reaction of the government of the United States of America ====
Some groups sought the help of their governments to fight what they saw as religious intolerance in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/2000/090500-4.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Church of Scientology]] utilised pressure groups against the French government, and had some success with the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, which repeatedly brought the matter before the French government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193106/http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to pastor [[Jean-Arnold de Clermont]], head of the French Protestant federation and himself a strong critic of the first draft of the law, the complaints originating in the United States concerning religious freedom in France were largely based on biased, poor information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apologeticsindex.org/news1/an010521-20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a newspaper article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; the French government considered American interference regarding religious freedom in France as unwarranted meddling by the US government in France's internal affairs. Paul Webster wrote that President [[Jacques Chirac]] told Clinton that religious freedom would no longer be a subject for bilateral presidential talks, "in the light of what has been officially described as 'shocking' White House support for [[Church of Scientology|Scientologists]] and [[Unification Church|Moonies]]". The French government also described the  [[United States Congress]]'s introduction of laws protecting religious freedom internationally as "an unacceptable intrusion into internal affairs". [[Alain Vivien]], former chairman of the French ministerial mission to combat the influence of cults (MILS), and the president of the ''Centre Contre les Manipulations Mentales'' (Centre Against Mental Manipulation), said many observers believed that Clinton was making his peace with big religious movements, "because they offer an indispensable source of [[campaign finance|political financing]]", and that with the help of Scientologists, cults were infiltrating UN and European human rights associations and collaborating on virulent reports against France's policies.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html "France to crack down on sects"], by Paul Webster; Wednesday June 14, 2000. Retrieved 2007-01-01.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The French did not alter their law following these requests; and the claims and actions of the US government regarding the religious situation in France largely ceased with the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration.

Some critics of French legislation have voiced concerns that countries which do not have the same legal safeguards and constitutional rights as France may emulate this legislation. In the words of a US official:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064332/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |archive-date=2009-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet the law itself remains problematic not only because of the threat the language carries in France, but because it is even now being considered for emulation by countries that lack France’s commitment to [[rule of law]] and human rights. Such a model serves only too well as cover for those nations who persecute under the guise of law enforcement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 15 September 2006 the United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] released a report on religious freedom in France.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71380.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This report noted that "The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice." It reported mostly anonymous concerns over repression of religious freedom in France, notably in regards to what the report referred to in one case as "cult groups", as well as the law banning religious symbols in schools, and rising anti-semitism in France.

In [[philosophy]], the concept of '''The Absolute''', also known as '''The (Unconditioned) Ultimate''', '''The Wholly Other''', '''The [[Supreme Being]]''',  '''The Absolute/Ultimate Reality''', and other names, is the thing, being, entity, power, force, reality, presence, law, principle, etc. that possesses maximal [[Ontology|ontological]] status, existential ranking, existential greatness, or existentiality. In layman's terms, this is the one that is, in one way or another, the greatest, truest, or most [[Reality|real]] [[being]].

There are many conceptions of The Absolute in various fields and subjects, such as [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[Spirituality|spiritual traditions]], [[mathematics]], and even [[natural science]]. The nature of these conceptions can range from "merely" encompassing all [[Physics|physical]] existence, [[nature]], or [[reality]], to being completely unconditioned existentially, [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcending]] all concepts, notions, and types, kinds, and categories of being.

The Absolute is often thought of as causing to come into being manifestations that interact with lower or lesser forms of being. This is either done passively, through [[Emanationism|emanations]], or actively, through [[avatar]]s and [[incarnation]]s. These existential manifestations, which themselves can possess [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] attributes, only contain minuscule or infinitesimal portions of the true essence of The Absolute.

The term itself was not in use in ancient or medieval philosophy, but closely related to the description of God as ''[[Actus purus]]'' (Pure Actuality) in [[scholasticism]]. It was introduced in modern philosophy, notably by [[Hegel]], for "the sum of all being, actual and potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Absolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has since also been adopted in  [[perennial philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=9780061724947|location=New York|language=English}}

==Major conceptions of The Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
There are three general ways of conceiving the Absolute. The Absolute might be (1) the first and greatest being, (2) not a being at all but the "ground" of being, or (3) both the ground of being and a being.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In conception one the Absolute is the most true and intelligible reality. It can be spoken of and known. For example, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s Absolute Spirit is the most true reality. It is thinkable, speakable, and exists in the objective world by comprehending everything, including people, states, and world history.

In conception two the Absolute might be conceived of as utterly outside of all other reality and hence unintelligible. It cannot be known or spoken about. Plato's Socrates says that "[[Form of the Good|The Form of the Good]]" is "beyond being",&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Book VI, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is even beyond thought, language, and normal categories of existence.

St. [[John of the Cross]] says:
{{poemquote
|text=He who truly arrives there
cuts free from himself;
all that he knew before
now seems worthless,
and his knowledge so soars
that he is left in unknowing
transcending all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Saint-John-Cross-ebook/dp/B00V21HZ8G/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461745961&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=st+john+of+the+cross|title=The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross, Volume 1 of 2|last=Cross|first=St John of the|date=2015-01-16|publisher=Waxkeep Publishing|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In conception three the Absolute is seen as transcending duality and distinction. This concept of a fundamental reality that transcends or includes all other reality is usually (but not always) associated with [[divinity]]. While this conception initially seems contradictory, it has been highly influential. One way to understand this third conception is to consider the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''.

{{poemquote
|text=The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
|source=Tao Te Ching, 1
}}

These opening lines distinguish between two [[Tao]]s. One is the "eternal Tao" (which cannot be named or explained) and the other "Tao" seems to exist in space and time (and can be named and explained). The eternal Tao is beyond existence and cannot be named or fully understood, while the other Tao exists and can be known. The eternal Tao is infinite; the other is finite. The eternal Tao is formless; the other is formed. The eternal Tao is transcendent; the other is immanent. The other "Tao" is an attempt to describe the "eternal Tao" in human terms; but such effort can never express the eternal Tao fully. He continues:
{{poemquote
|text=The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations
These two emerge together but differ in name
The unity is said to be the mystery.
}}

In these lines, he further discusses the difference between the two Taos. The eternal Tao is "nameless" and is the origin of Heaven and Earth; this origin can be understood as an underlying [[metaphysics]] that cannot be described fully. The "named" Tao, on the other hand, is able to describe specific phenomenons that exist in space and time, hence it is the mother of myriad of things; it also can be treated as the humanly conceived concepts in the effort to describe our physical world. Later, he points out that both the "named" and the "nameless" emerge together from the same eternal Tao. This seemingly self-contradictory unity, of course, is said to be the mystery to be understood.

===Interpretations===
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
While these conceptions are superficially similar, they admit of multiple interpretations. Some philosophers, especially perennialists and [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophers, find great significance in the similarities between these different words and argue that various/all cultures past and present have an identical concept of the 'Absolute'.

Other philosophers, however, argue that these concepts are not the same,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6aHAgAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy of Religion: A Contemporary Introduction|last=Yandell|first=Keith E.|date=2002-01-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134827237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|title=Exclusivism, Inclusivism, and Kardiatheology|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MOSEIA|journal=Philosophia Christi|volume=11|issue=2|pages=293–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Logos is rational and formal whereas Brahman is formless and irrational; and since Plato's Form of the Good is impersonal where the Christian God is personal; since Bradley's Absolute is a conscious experience whereas [[Brand Blanshard]]'s Absolute is an unconscious, intelligible system.

Perennialist philosophers such as John Hick argue that even if the concepts vary slightly, the reality of the Absolute reality behind the varying concepts is the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/|title=Hick, John {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Within religious traditions ====
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
Philosophers such as [[Adi Shankara]] denied the Absolute any personal sense, whereas philosophers such as [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], tended to identify the Absolute with a [[Ishvara|personal God]]. The [[Traditionalist School]], via [[Frithjof Schuon]], admits:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that God as creator, revealer, and savior is not to be identified with the Absolute as such; it is likewise true that God in Himself, in the full depth of His reality, is not to be reduced to the creative Function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=261|title=Form and Substance in the Religions|last=Schuon|first=Frithjof|date=1974|website=Studies in Comparative Religion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early Hinduism identified [[Brahman]] with [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]. The same immortal spirit was conceived of as functional in the world in three ways: creation, preservation, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03270.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Draupadi-harana Parva: Section CCLXX|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan|date=|website=Sacred Texts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form of Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the Preserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was therefore no real contradiction between [[Bhakti|love of a personal God]] and [[Brahman|an impersonal Absolute]], although the latter was sometimes conceived of as "purer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/03/04/nirguna-and-saguna-brahman/|title=Nirguna and Saguna Brahman|last=Rodrigues|first=Hillary|date=2015|website=Mahavidya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=Until this occurs, “the world…even including Isvara (the Lord), is not ultimately true or real, but that ultimate reality belongs only to the infinite, eternal, unchanging, pure bliss consciousness that is Brahman…all that we see with our senses, even our private thoughts, Advaita claims, are not ultimately real” (Betty 216).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]], and most [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] Indian religions, gave God five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. [[Shiva]], as [[Brahman]], would therefore act in the world as a personal God. Yet this distinction between the Absolute and Infinite, or Transcendent and Immanent is not entirely, in itself, absolute. Philosophers like Shankara believe that upon doing away with [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] the entire universe disappears, including the notion of a personal God. Philosophers such as [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] and [[Ramanuja]], tend to propound an identification of the Absolute with God, whereas later philosophers such as [[Nimbarka]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]], tended to identify the Absolute with a personal form of God ([[Krishna]]). Either way, all these claims, taken in context, tend to prove non-contradictory.

The quote above, via Schuon, is actually fully represented within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. [[Brahma]], the creator god, is not worshiped within Hinduism. The only deities that are worshiped, are [[Shiva]], and [[Vishnu]]. Both Shiva and Vishnu, by their respective devotees, are represented as having power over the following five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. However, a further distinction is made by Shankara: God is not [[Brahman]] (the Absolute). Rather the appearance of God is still via the power of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. So there are in effect, three levels, which Schuon himself observes: Brahman (the Absolute), God as creator, revealer, and savior (AKA, Shiva or Vishnu), and finally God as creator (AKA, Brahma). Incidental reasons are given for Brahma's lack of worship, a Hindu myth attributes this situation to a curse by [[Bhrigu]]. [[Devdutt Pattanaik]], an Indian author, gives some philosophical reasons. Ultimately the reason is actually inherent ("inherent" in the Absolute) and theological.

== Relation of humanity to the Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}

[[Laozi]] taught that the Tao was not only the ultimate reality but the ideal of human life. Another conceptual similarity between various conceptions is that the ultimate reality also somehow reveals to humans the way to live. For example, Plato taught that the Good was both the source of reality, the highest object of knowledge, and the ultimate end of desire.

[[C. S. Lewis]] explains the connection between the highest reality and human action in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLRLoWGgWqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=abolition+of+man&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_sDY3P_ZAhXJrFQKHcIlCPgQ6AEIKTAA&amp;q=rta|title=The Abolition of Man|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-06-065294-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=In early Hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity to, or almost participation in, the Rta—that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta, is constantly identified with satya or truth, correspondence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was 'beyond existence' and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it. The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar. 'In ritual', say the Analects, 'it is harmony with Nature that is prized.' The ancient Jews likewise praise the Law as being 'true'. This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as 'the Tao'.|sign=C.S.

{{Quotation|Because the Ultimate Reality which is denoted by the word 'Absolute' or 'Parabrahman' (卍) is the very core of our being as well as the cause and basis of the universe of which we are part, we can no more get away from it than our solar system can get away from the sun round which it resolves and from which it receives everything which keeps it alive and moving. Although the Absolute is sometimes referred to by such epithets as the Void, Ever-Darkness etc. and is beyond intellectual comprehension, still, from the intellectual point of view it is the most profound concept in the whole realm of philosophy. The fact that it is called 'Unknowable' does not mean that it is beyond the range of philosophical or religious thought and something on which thinking is impossible or undesirable. The very fact that it is the heart and the basis of the universe should make it the most intriguing object of enquiry within the realms of the intellect. |I. K. Taimni|''Man, God and the Universe''|Chapter 1&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Aldous Huxley says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1945|isbn=978-0-06-172494-7|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=Only the transcendent, the completely other, can be immanent without being modified by the becoming of that in which it dwells. The Perennial Philosophy teaches that it is desirable and indeed necessary to know the spiritual Ground of things, not only within the soul, but also outside in the world and, beyond world and soul, in its transcendent otherness 'in heaven.' ... God within and God without; these are two abstract notions, which can be entertained by the understanding and expressed in words.|sign=Aldous Huxley|source=The Perennial Philosophy}}

Similarly, the Hindu Taimni describes the [[Parabrahman]] as unknowable by the human mind and unthinkable but the highest object of realization and the most profound object of philosophical enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] likewise taught that the goal of philosophy was to "contemplate the One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|title=Plotinus - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiencing the Absolute ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Philosophers and religious adherents who aim to pattern their life after the Absolute reality sometimes claim to have experienced the Absolute. They report [[mystical experience]]s, feelings of oneness, transcendence of their everyday personality or of personhood altogether.

=== Representing the Absolute===
[[File:Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200px|The Absolute represented as ''[[Yggdrasill]]'' in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic religion]].]]
The Absolute is conceptually defined as something inexpressible and perhaps unthinkable. This concept creates special problems for expression in words, poetry, mythology, and art. Writers, [[Alex Grey|painters]], storytellers, filmmakers&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''Tree of Life'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are two good examples (one religious, one atheistic) of the use of contradiction to convey the Absolute in the final sequences.&lt;/ref&gt; often use paradox or contradiction because of the "contradictory aspect of the ultimate reality".&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 86"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the Absolute can be mediated or [[revelation|revealed]] through [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; For Eliade the "[[Arche|archaic]]" mind is constantly aware of the presence of the Sacred, and for this mind all symbols are [[religion|religious]] (relinking to the Origin). Through symbols human beings can get an immediate "intuition" of certain features of the inexhaustible Sacred. The mind makes use of images to grasp the ultimate reality of things because reality manifests itself in contradictory ways and therefore can't be described in concepts. It is therefore the image as such, as a whole bundle of meaning, that is "true" (faithful, trustworthy).&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"/&gt; Eliade says :&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the ''sacred'' is equivalent to a ''power'', and, in the last analysis, to ''reality''. The sacred is saturated with ''being''. Sacred power means reality and at the same time enduringness and efficacy. The polarity sacred-profane is often expressed as opposition between real and ''unreal'' or pseudoreal. ''[...]'' Thus it is easy to understand that religious man deeply desires ''to be'', to participate in ''reality'', to be saturated with power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Common symbols of the Absolute include [[world tree]]s, the [[tree of life]], [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], [[fire]], children,&lt;ref&gt;See [[George MacDonald]]'s ''The Golden Key''&lt;/ref&gt; [[circles]], [[mandalas]], and the human body.

[[Guru Nanak]] in the [[Japji Sahib]] (4th Pauri) says, "In amrit velā meditate on the grandeur of the one true Name."&lt;ref name="McLeod" /&gt; The importance of Amrit Vela is found throughout the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

In the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] it is written to arise Amrit Velā, bath, and meditate on the divine ''Naam'' (through [[Simran]] and [[Nam Japo|Naam Japna]]). Sikhs recite their morning ''[[Nitnem]]'' during Amrit vela.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baron Kriminel''' is a much feared spirit or [[Loa]] in the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion. He is envisioned as a murderer who has been condemned to death, and is invoked to pronounce swift judgment. Baron Kriminel is syncretized with [[Saint Martin de Porres]], perhaps because his feast day is November 3, the day after Fete Ghede. His colors are black, purple, white and deep blood red.

==Worship==
A person possessed by Baron Kriminel shouts obscenities, spits libations to all past criminals and threatens to kill surrounding people who violate them. If, during possession, Baron Kriminel is presented with food he does not like, he will threaten to bite chunks out of the arms of the possessed person. He sometimes calls for sacrifices of black chickens to be doused in [[petrol]] and set alight. The shrieking  of the chickens when being burned alive is said to appeal to the cruel nature of Baron Kriminel and appease him. Baron Kriminel is said to be one of Baron Samedi's many aspects.&lt;ref&gt;http://horrorpedia.com/2013/10/15/baron-samedi-and-haitian-loa-folklore-religion/&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Kriminel will often grant requests in lieu, he is said to return on [[Fete Ghede]], the Voduns' "Festival of the Dead" (November 2), to claim payment.

{{Buddhism}}
Buddhist views, although varying on a series of [[Chinese Buddhist canon|canon]]s within the three branches of [[Buddhism]] ([[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]), observe the concept of [[euthanasia]], or "mercy killing", in a denunciatory manner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umoar.mu.edu.mm/bitstream/handle/123456789/166/The%20Response%20to%20Euthanasia.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The Response to Euthanasia from the Perspective of Buddhism, Mandalay University Research Journal 3, 188-195|last=Lin|first=Saw|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods of euthanasia include [[Voluntary euthanasia|voluntary]], [[Involuntary euthanasia|involuntary]], and [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perrett RW |title=Buddhism, euthanasia and the sanctity of life |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=309–13 |date=October 1996|pmid=8910785 |pmc=1377066 |doi=10.1136/jme.22.5.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, as one school of Buddhism evolved into the next, their scriptures recorded through the oral messages of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself on Buddhist principles and values followed, guiding approximately 500 million Buddhists spanning the globe on their path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the [[Monasticism|Monastic Rule]], or [[Vinaya]], a consensus is reached by the Buddha on euthanasia and [[assisted suicide]] that expresses a lack of fondness of its practice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keown D, Keown J |title=Killing, karma and caring: euthanasia in Buddhism and Christianity |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=265–9 |date=October 1995|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/21/5/265.full.pdf |pmid=8558539 |pmc=1376772 |doi=10.1136/jme.21.5.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddhism does not confirm that life should be conserved by implementing whatever is necessary to prolong death, but instead expresses that the intentional precipitation of death is ethically inadmissible in every condition one is presented in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Vinaya ==
The Vinaya [[Tripiṭaka|Tripitaka]] is one of three Buddhist canonical sources that makes up the Tripitaka that most relates to euthanasia. It was created to encompass a series of case laws in which Buddha provided judgement on various matters, even though the term "euthanasia" is not specifically mentioned.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monks and nuns are meant to follow the decorum that is relayed, which expresses what is considered to be wrongfully killing someone (prohibited by Buddhist precepts) by the actions of another who is conferred to follow holy orders and those who are not. Outside of Vinaya, there is no specific mention in early Buddhist texts on euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the life of Buddha, instances occurred when monks who practiced medicine were put in situations where they had to make a decision to assist in another's suicide by physically taking their life, providing the instrument used to take their life, or allowing the person to suffer, as observed in cases written in Vinaya. The Buddha, therefore, included a precept in Vinaya against the termination of another human life following the discovery that monks either took their own life or requested that others kill them because they were unhappy with their body. Buddha stated that:

{{Quote|text=Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,): "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr|title=Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha (rules for male monks), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=access to insight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

With this, Buddha later expanded the precept in the third [[parajika]], adding the punishment of excommunication for life from the [[Sangha]] after recognizing a number of monks provoking a patient to believe that he should choose death over life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this instance, the monks praised the idea that death was beautiful to a sick monk, persuading him to take an unrevealed measure to end his life. Because of the monk's expression of virtue, as he was informed by other monks, he would receive a good rebirth. As a result of these provocations, the monk stopped eating and later died.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues|last=Harvey|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|year=2000|isbn=978-0-511-07584-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.295}}

== Death and karma ==
Buddhists believe that life begins at the point of birth and ends when the individual dies. Throughout the course of the individual's life, between life and death, they are to be respected with dignity, regardless of their state of mental capacity or [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] functions. What constitutes life in a body is [[Thermoregulation|usma]] (heat), [[Vitality|ayu]] (vitality), and [[Vinnana|vinanna]] (sentiency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67323-0/abstract|title=End of life: The buddhist view. The Lancet 366, 952–955|journal=The Lancet|volume=366|issue=9489|pages=952–955|last=Keown|first=Damien|date=September 16, 2005|website=|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67323-0|pmid=16154024|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Buddhists, there is much confusion as to when one is truly dead. Some consider death to be when the brain loses its functionality. And there are those who disagree with this idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Buddha passed away, according to ancient texts, his 25-year personal attendant [[Ananda]] declared him as dead. However, Ananda was later corrected by a monk senior to him, claiming that Buddha was only in a severe state of yogistic stupor. During this yogic [[trance]], Buddha lacked any vital signs of life, making it unclear for future Buddhists to determine the point of death when such physiological states exist and are relayed in Buddhist literary texts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although at death one loses all physical possessions, leaving their family, loved ones, and achievements all behind, death does not destroy all that belongs to a person. The purification of their character through virtuous and meditative practices carries over into their next life and into their mental sequence of continuation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Traditional bhavachakra wall mural of Yama holding the wheel of life, Buddha pointing the way out.jpg|thumb|[[Yama]], Lord of Death, holding the [[Bhavacakra|Bhavachakra]] or Wheel of Life]]Buddhists hold the belief that upon death, they are reborn and will experience life through a series of lifetimes called [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] until they can cease to desire and nirvana is obtained. In conjunction with a person's previously attained karma, their state of mind at the point of death holds great importance when the determining of what kind of rebirth is to take place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are six realms of life in Buddhist cosmology: Hell realm ([[Naraka]]), hungry ghost ([[Preta]]) realm, animal realm ([[Animals in Buddhism|Tiracchānayoni]]), human realm ([[Human beings in Buddhism|Manussa]]), demi-god realm ([[Asura]]), and god realm ([[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lecso PA |title=Euthanasia: a Buddhist perspective |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=1986|pmid=11651853 |doi=10.1007/BF01533053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the realms that exist, the human realm is the most anticipated, yet the most difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the level of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] one garners in their current lifetime, it is determined at which realm one diverges to next upon death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first three realms (Hell realm, hungry ghost realm, and animal realm) are the most detested of the six and are meant to cause suffering, disallowing proper mental capabilities as a result of negative karma from negative acts performed during the previous life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And although more acceptable than the former, the asura and god realm remain unfavorable as they permit one ultimate happiness but prevents the opportunity for the spirit to progress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only through good karma can one's spirit reach the human realm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Euthanasia, although it can be considered a compassionate act, is not seen in Buddhism as an act of selflessness and benevolence, but rather an act of  damage masked as help, which in turn can result in negative karma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If someone is suffering as a result of sickness, it could be a result of karma, and ending their life is not likely to end their adversity, as the suffering caused by karma will only follow them after death until its energy concludes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Compassion ==
[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 011 The Buddha and Ananda tend a Sick Monk (9244516966).jpg|thumb|306x306px|The Buddha and Ananda tend a sick monk]]
[[Compassion]] ([[karuṇā]]) is a Buddhist value that reinforces how Buddhism views standards in medicine, which is observed in all three schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|p.295}} Although it can be seen as morally good, committing an act through compassion is not always justified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking a life out of compassion to mitigate the affliction one experiences through illness or injury is an instance in which a person may feel he or she is vindicated to exploit euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Buddhism and the [[Bodhisattva]], it can create incongruities through the infringement of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of an unjustified act of compassion is a case written in the Vinaya, where a convicted man is hastily executed after a monk requests the executioner to do so, as to not prolong his suffering and the sorrowful period he has to wait.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A morally good scenario of compassion would be if a patient in a hospital in his or her right mind feels that their ailment is using too much of a valuable resource in limited quantities, or causing their family to spend large sums of money that is not readily available on medical bills to keep them alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Out of morally good compassion, he or she might decide to cease the sources of life preservation without pressure from others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Had those associations been pressuring the patient to forgo further life saving treatment, this could be observed as murderous.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If the patient were terminally ill and unable to eat on their own accord, it would be a requirement of his or her associations to assist them, even if intravenous feeding was necessary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism paints life in a way that is fundamentally valuable, and it should never be surrendered for any reason, whether compassion, amity, or anything of value.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It would be an ill-advised way to show compassion rooted in misconception to endorse death using compassion as the reasoning.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vegetative state ==
According to Buddhist precepts, someone who is in a [[vegetative state]] is neither dead nor alive, but instead is said to be in some form of obscure state of mind and still a living individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They lack the necessity to rely on outside assistance to support their ability to stay alive other than being supplemented with nutrients to keep them functioning for a significant number of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this, Buddhism sees someone in a vegetative state as a living, breathing life form, because the value in which one's life holds is not observed through individualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Buddhism views this state of being as damaged, the individual should be treated no different than before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both animals and humans, prior to their birth as they await in the mother's womb, have value and therefore should not have their life taken from them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, some Buddhists are under the impression that an unconscious life, or one that lacks awareness, does not have value, which is highly debatable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism shows that even with a damaged physical organ, such as the brain, someone is still deserving of compassion because they are still capable of causing varying emotions in someone who cares for them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To end a life because of a patient's state of mind and to deny them treatment would be an act of abandonment, which would be considered irrational and unfair because Buddhists have a strong belief in compassion for all living things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A vegetative state can be considered a varied form of meditation where the sentience of someone acts in a way not ordinary to what is regularly observed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another form of consciousness where the body does not react is that of "formless" rebirths.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Due to these meditative states, it is often difficult to determine in a physical manner a state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The state of consciousness, at the time, may be experiencing a demonstration of going through the processes of death in ultimate preparation so that once death does come, it can receive the best form of rebirth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this process of preparation, the eyes and other sense-organs will cease to function, but the person's sense of touch, brain function, and life force lie in the heart.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, considering the conception of meditative states, some in a vegetative state are therefore still sentient.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Being in a continuous state of vegetation is not the same as the process by which one prepares for death, even though it does resemble it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The possibility exists for one to lack the function to breathe and think, but still be alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Alternatives to euthanasia ==
[[File:San Francisco Zen Center.jpg|thumb|The San Francisco Zen Center]]
Moving someone who is terminally ill into [[hospice care]] to help mitigate physical pain with [[Analgesic|pain relievers]] that is not intended to end their life, allowing them to pass away painless and comfortable, is a highly considerable alternative to euthanasia. Hospice care is meant to assist a person to have, what is called a "good death."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When one nears death, they should be able to reflect on their life peacefully. Since 1971, the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] has offered assistance to terminally ill patients, with trained hospice employees since the inception of a hospice training program in 1987. The Buddhist Hospice Trust in the United Kingdom has been an alternative to this center since its founding in 1987. Not only does it provide volunteers to visit those nearing death, but it provides an avenue for those who lost someone they cared about to receive counsel and sympathy and is also used as a center into researching death and mourning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The purpose of such a center is to truly alleviate any amount of anxiety one could experience when approaching death, leaving known loved ones behind, and to ensure a clear and calm state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hospice care employees therefore prefer not to allow a person to die in an anesthetized, unconscious state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A positive transition to a future life is best obtained when one dies with a clear conscience, free of anger, dissent, and anxiety, and in a relaxed state of being.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, a "good death" is facilitated by family and friends, who do their best to ensure the dying person is untroubled and uplifted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Different religions have varying stances on the use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], historically and presently. In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an [[entheogenic]], particularly in the [[Indian subcontinent]] where the tradition continues on a more limited basis.

In the modern era, religions with prohibitions against intoxicants, such as Islam, Buddhism, Bahai, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and others have opposed the use of cannabis by members, or in some cases opposed the liberalization of cannabis laws. Other groups, such as some Protestant and Jewish factions, have supported the use of [[medicinal cannabis]].

==Bahá'í==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], use of alcohol and other drugs for intoxication, as opposed to medical prescription, is prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khali Akhtar Khavari|author2=Teresa McCray Harmon|title=The Relationship between the Degree of Professed Religious Belief and Use of Drugs|journal=International Journal of the Addictions|volume=17|issue=5|pages=847–857|date=1982|doi=10.3109/10826088209056331}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Bahá'í laws]]. But Bahá'í practice is such laws should be applied with "tact and wisdom".&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= law |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tobacco is an individual decision, it is yet strongly frowned on and not explicitly forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Udo Schaefer|title=In a blue haze, smoking and Bahá'í ethics|publisher=Zero Palm Press|edition=Translated from the original German language edition: Ethische Aspekte des Rauchens.

{{quote|Regarding [[hashish]] you have pointed out that some Persians have become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the All-Merciful? Alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absurdity, but this opium, this foul fruit of the infernal tree, and this wicked hashish extinguish the mind, freeze the spirit, petrify the soul, waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-187.html Notes #170.

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the [[Five Precepts|Fifth Precept]] is frequently interpreted to mean "refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to heedlessness", although in some direct translations, the Fifth Precept refers specifically to alcohol.&lt;ref name="yinshun"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yin-Shun | first = Venerable | editor = Wing H.

==Christianity==

===Catholicism===
Prior to assuming his position as leader of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Pope Francis]] had spoken against recreational cannabis. He stated in 2013 in Buenos Aires: "A reduction in the spread and influence of drug addiction will not be achieved by a liberalization of drug use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bindrim|first=Kira|title=Pope Francis Speaks Out Against Legalization of Marijuana and Other Drugs|url=http://www.newsweek.com/pope-francis-says-he-opposes-marijuana-legalization-255708|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The catechism of the Catholic Church states that "The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P80.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |date= |accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{main|Cannabis and Latter-day Saints}}

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], there is general prohibition against intoxicating substances. In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members. In 2016, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] urged members to oppose legalization of recreational cannabis use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=West|first=Camille|title=First Presidency Asks Members to Oppose Recreational Marijuana, Assisted Suicide|url=https://www.lds.org/church/news/first-presidency-asks-members-to-oppose-recreational-marijuana-assisted-suicide?lang=eng|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=LDS.org|date=October 14, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church says it has "raised no objection to SB 89" (non-psychoactive medical marijuana in Utah).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Church Urges 'Cautious Approach' on Medical Marijuana Issue in Utah|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-urges-cautious-approach-medical-marijuana-issue-utah|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wells|first=David|title=LDS Church issues new statement on medical marijuana|url=http://fox13now.com/2016/02/12/lds-church-clarifies-stance-on-medical-marijuana/|publisher=[[KSTU]]|website=Fox13Now.com|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodoxy===
The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] has resisted legalization of cannabis in that country.&lt;ref&gt;http://neweasterneurope.eu/articles-and-commentary/2276-fighting-georgia-s-draconian-anti-drug-law&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
The [[Arkansas Baptist State Convention]] voted to discourage medical marijuana in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Strode |url=http://www.bpnews.net/47842/marijuana-legalization-on-9-state-ballots |title=Marijuana legalization on 9 state ballots |publisher=Bpnews.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the executive director of the [[Florida Baptist Convention]], Tommy Green, also said that congregations should be encouraged to vote against [[Florida Amendment 2 (2016)|expanded legalization of medical marijuana in Florida]]. The 
National Evangelical Association of Belize opposed the 2017 decriminalization of [[cannabis in Belize]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.bz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14372:churches-complain-about-marijuana-law&amp;catid=40:politics&amp;Itemid=90&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assemblies of God USA]], as well as other [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[Holiness Movement|holiness churches]], have historically advocated abstinence from all alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics. Supporters of this view generally cite biblical passages enjoining respect for one's body as well as forbidding intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/topics/charctr_08_drugs.cfm | title = Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Drugs | last = | first = | date = | website = ag.org | publisher = Assemblies of God USA | access-date = April 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Protestant churches have endorsed the legality of medical marijuana, including the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[United Methodist Church]], [[United Church of Christ]], and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosch |first=Torie |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/03/what_would_jesus_smoke.html |title=What do Christian groups think about marijuana? |work=Slate |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ganja Smoking - Gangasagar Fair Transit Camp - Kolkata 2013-01-12 2646.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[Hindu]] man smoking cannabis in [[Kolkata, India]].]]
During the [[Hindu]] festival of [[Holi]], people consume ''bhang'' which contains cannabis flowers.&lt;ref name="commission"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission|year=1894|location=Simla, India|publisher=Government Central Printing House|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/Library/studies/inhemp/4chapt9.htm}} Chapter IX: Social and Religious Customs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skunked.co.uk/articles/history-intoxicant.htm |title=The History of the Intoxicant Use of Marijuana |publisher=National Commission of Marijuana and Drug Abuse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050813080240/http://www.skunked.co.uk/articles/history-intoxicant.htm |archivedate=2005-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one description, when the ''[[amrita]]'' (elixir of life) was produced from the [[Samudra manthan|churning of the ocean]] by the devas and the asuras, [[Shiva]] created cannabis from his own body to purify the elixir (whence, for cannabis, the epithet ''angaja'' or "body-born"). Another account suggests that the cannabis plant sprang up when a drop of the elixir dropped on the ground. Thus, cannabis is used by [[rishi|sages]] due to association with elixir and [[Shiva]]. 

[[File:Bhang eaters before two huts (6124556163).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Bhang]] eaters from India c. 1790.  Bhang is  an [[cannabis edible|edible preparation]] of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] native to the [[Indian subcontinent]].

In Hinduism, wise drinking of ''bhang'' (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with [[Shiva]] and avoid the miseries of [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]] in the [[Saṃsāra|future life]]. It is also believed to have medicinal benefits. In contrast, foolish drinking of ''bhang'' without rites is considered a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/Inhemp/7relhemp.htm|title=Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report - Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Halal|Islamic dietary laws}}
The [[Quran]] does not directly forbid cannabis; however, cannabis is deemed to be ''[[khamr (intoxicant)|khamr]]'' (an intoxicant) by many religious scholars and therefore generally believed to be ''[[haraam]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdul-Rahman|first=Muhammad Saed|title=Islam: Questions and Answers - Pedagogy Education and Upbringing|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|year=2003|page=123| isbn= 978-1-86179-296-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pakistan Narcotics Control Board, Colombo Plan Bureau|title=First National Workshop on Prevention and Control of Drug Abuse in Pakistan 25–30 August 1975|location=Rawalpindi|publisher=Workshop Report|year=1975|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] by the prophet Mohammed states: "If much intoxicates, then even a little is haraam."&lt;ref&gt;AD 25;5&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these prohibitions, cannabis is consumed in many parts of the Islamic world, even sometimes in a religious context particularly within the [[Sufi]] mystic movement.&lt;ref name="Ferrara2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark S.

The Sufi tradition attributes the discovery of cannabis to [[Jafar Sharazi]] (Sheikh Haydar), a Sufi leader in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Jones2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jones|title=Spliffs: A Celebration of Cannibis Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abK_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|date=29 July 2013|publisher=Pavilion Books|isbn=978-1-909396-32-6|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sufis attribute its origin to the apocryphal [[Khidr]] ("Green Man").&lt;ref name="Knight2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Muhammad Knight|title=Journey to the End of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XM4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=10 December 2009|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=978-1-59376-552-1|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern Islamic leaders state that medical cannabis, but not recreational, is permissible in Islam. Imam Mohammad Elahi in [[Dearborn Heights]], Michigan (United States), declared: "Obviously, smoking marijuana for fun is wrong... It should be permissible only if that is the only option in a medical condition prescribed by medical experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hijazi |first=Samer |url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/news/id_12118/Marijuana-in-Islam:-Smokers-and-scholars-weigh-in.html |title=Marijuana: Arab Smokers, religious scholars weigh in |publisher=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|Cannabis and Judaism}}

Though the argument has not been accepted by mainstream scholars, some writers have theorized that cannabis may have been used ritually in early Judaism, though these claims "have been widely dismissed as erroneous".&lt;ref&gt;(Merlin, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sula Benet]] (1967) claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, Orthodox rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] stated in 1973 that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Jacobs1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian G. Jacobs|title=Judaism looks at modern issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVIRAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Aviva Press|isbn=978-0-9511560-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earleywine2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitch Earleywine|title=Pot Politics: Marijuana and the Costs of Prohibition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgASDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-518802-8|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosner2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Rosner|title=Biomedical Ethics and Jewish Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7w2oAmohpEC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2001|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-701-4|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Orthodox rabbis [[Efraim Zalmanovich]] (2013) and [[Chaim Kanievsky]] (2016) stated that medical, but not recreational, cannabis is kosher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elsa Vulliamy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/marijuana-is-kosher-for-passover-leading-rabbi-rules-a6995761.html |title=Marijuana is kosher for Passover, leading rabbi rules |publisher=The Independent |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rastafari==
It is not known when [[Rastafari]] first claimed cannabis to be sacred, but it is clear that by the late 1940s Rastafari was associated with cannabis smoking at the Pinnacle community of [[Leonard Howell]]. Rastafari see cannabis as a sacramental and deeply beneficial plant that is the [[Tree of Life]] mentioned in the [[Bible]]. [[Peter Tosh]], among many others, has quoted {{bibleref2|Revelation|22:2}}, "... the herb is the healing of the nations."  The use of cannabis, and particularly of long-stemmed water-pipes called [[chalice (pipe)|chalices]], is an integral part of what Rastafari call "reasoning sessions" where members join together to discuss life according to the Rasta perspective. They see the use of cannabis as bringing them closer to [[God]] ([[Jah]]), allowing the user to penetrate the truth of things more clearly.

While it is not necessary to use cannabis to be a Rastafari, many use it regularly as a part of their faith, and pipes of cannabis are dedicated to His Imperial Majesty [[Haile Selassie I]] before being smoked. According to the [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult group]] the [[Watchman Fellowship]] "The herb is the key to new understanding of the self, the universe, and God. It is the vehicle to cosmic consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.watchman.org/profile/rastapro.htm |title= Rastafarianism |work= Profiles |publisher= [[Watchman Fellowship|Watchman Fellowship ministry]] |first= Rick |last= Branch |year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to burn the corruption out of the human heart. Rubbing the ashes into the skin from smoked cannabis is also considered a healthy practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Joseph Owens (Jesuit)|title=Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica|year=1974|isbn=0-435-98650-3|first=Joseph|last=Owens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Rastafari movement, elders of the 20th-century religious movement known as the [[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]], consider cannabis to be the "eucharist",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepenthes.lycaeum.org/Drugs/THC/bible.html|title=Marijuana and the Bible|publisher=[[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming it as an oral tradition from [[Ethiopia]] dating back to the time of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_spirit2.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis Vault : Spiritual Use #2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology==
[[Scientology]] opposes the use of cannabis, and made "Truth About Marijuana" the focus of their 2016 [[World Health Day]] presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologynews.org/press-releases/activity/church-hosts-truth-about-marijuana-event.html |title=Church Hosts "Truth About Marijuana" Event |publisher=Scientologynews.org |date=2016-04-18 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{main|Cannabis and Sikhism}}
[[File:Process of making bhang in Punjab, India.jpg|thumb|Process of making bhang in a Sikh village in Punjab, India.&lt;br&gt;Photos taken by Marcus Prasad]]

In [[Sikhism]], the First Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]], stated that using any mind altering substance (without medical purposes) is a distraction to keeping the mind clean of the name of God.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} According to the ''[[Sikh Rehat Maryada]]'', "A Sikh must not take hemp (cannabis), opium, liquor, tobacco, in short any intoxicant. His only routine intake should be food and water".&lt;ref name="amritworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritworld.com/main/?p=82#sthash.agD98t5F.dpbs|title=The ‘Sukhnidhaan’ or ‘Bhang’ (cannabis)|work=Amrit World|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there exists a tradition of Sikhs using edible cannabis, often in the form of the beverage [[bhang]], particularly among the Sikh community known as [[Nihang]].&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA378|date=March 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=378–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghHawley2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Michael Hawley|title=Re-imagining South Asian Religions: Essays in Honour of Professors Harold G.

==Taoism==

Beginning around the 4th century, Taoist texts mentioned using cannabis in [[censer]]s. Needham cited the (ca. 570 AD) Taoist encyclopedia ''Wushang Biyao'' 無上秘要 ("Supreme Secret Essentials") that cannabis was added into ritual incense-burners, and suggested the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with "hallucinogenic smokes".&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 150]. From ancient Chinese fumigation techniques with "toxic smokes" for pests and "holy smokes" for demons, "what started as a 'smoking out' of undesirable things, changed now to a 'smoking in' of heavenly things into oneself."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yuanshi shangzhen zhongxian ji'' 元始上真眾仙記 ("Records of the Assemblies of the Perfected Immortals"), which is attributed to [[Ge Hong]] (283-343), says:

:For those who begin practicing the Tao it is not necessary to go into the mountains. … Some with purifying incense and sprinkling and sweeping are also able to call down the Perfected Immortals. The followers of the Lady Wei and of Hsu are of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady [[Wei Huacun]] 魏華存 (252-334) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376) founded the Taoist [[Shangqing School]]. The Shangqing scriptures were supposedly dictated to [[Yang Xi]] 楊羲 (330-c. 386) in nightly revelations from [[Xian (Taoism)|immortals]], and Needham proposed Yang was "aided almost certainly by cannabis". The ''Mingyi bielu'' 名醫別錄 ("Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians"), written by the Taoist pharmacologist [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536), who also wrote the first commentaries to the Shangqing canon, says, "Hemp-seeds (麻勃) are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians (''shujia'' 術家) say that if one consumes them with [[ginseng]] it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 151].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Rudgley|url=http://cannabis.net/hist/index.html|title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6th-century AD Taoist medical work, the ''Wuzangjing'' 五臟經 ("Five Viscera Classic") says, "If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present themselves you should constantly eat the inflorescences of the hemp plant."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, Ho Ping-Yu, and Lu Gwei-djen (1980). ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 4, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention''. Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvLroG7r2MYC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 213].&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Needham connected myths about [[Magu (deity)|Magu]], "the Hemp Damsel", with early Daoist religious usages of cannabis, pointing out that Magu was goddess of [[Shandong]]'s [[Sacred Mountains of China|sacred]] [[Mount Tai]], where cannabis "was supposed to be gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month, a day of seance banquets in the Taoist communities."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. 1974.

==Other cannabis-using religious movements==

Other religions have been founded in the past century that treat cannabis as a sacrament. They include the [[Santo Daime]] church, the [[THC Ministry]], Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly, the Church of Cognitive Therapy (COCT Ministry), Temple 420, Green Faith Ministries, the [[Church of Cognizance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n848/a01.html|last=Innes|first=Stephanie|title=Pot-Deifying Duo Guilty, Confident They'll Avoid Prison|date=2008-09-05|work=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of the Universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n1046/a05.html|last=Jackson|first=Hayes|title=Appeal Date Set For Pot Priests|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Torstar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamm.com|title=Church of the Universe|publisher=[[Church of the Universe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Marijuana Church of Honolulu, the First Cannabis Church of Florida World Wide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabischurchfl.com/ First Cannabis Church of Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Life Ministry Church of Canthe, the Church of Higher Consciousness, and the federally tax-exempt inFormer Ministry Collective of Palms Springs, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informer.org|title=InFormer Ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informer.org/9900001.jpg|title=Rev.

Modern spiritual figures like [[Ram Dass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/ramdass.cfm |title=Ram Dass: Longtime Spiritual Leader, Opponent of the 'War on Drugs' |date=2004-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920210640/http://drugpolicy.org/library/ramdass.cfm |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; openly acknowledge that the use of cannabis has allowed them to gain a more spiritual perspective and use the herb frequently for both its medicinal and mind-altering properties.

In Mexico, followers of the growing cult of [[Santa Muerte]] regularly use marijuana smoke in purification ceremonies, with marijuana often taking the place of incense used in mainstream Catholic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktsm.com/news/only-9-the-dark-religion-santa-muerte |title=Only on 9: The Dark Religion of the Santa Muerte &amp;#124; KTSM News Channel 9 |publisher=Ktsm.com |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
The '''chaplain general''' is a senior chaplain in non-church organisations, such as the British and Canadian armies, and is responsible for the supervision of chaplains conducting religious services and ceremonies, representing the Christian faith in that organisation, and providing pastoral care and support within the organisation.

==History==
The post of Chaplain-General in the British Army dates from 1796.&lt;ref name=Roper1998&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roper |first1=Michael |title=The Records of the War Office and Related Departments, 1660-1964 |date=1998 |publisher=Public Record Office |location=Kew, Surrey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First World War]], the chaplain-general [[John Taylor Smith]] was equivalent to a [[major general]] and under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State. [[Llewellyn Henry Gwynne]] was from July 1915 deputy chaplain-general of the army in France, with the relative rank of major-general. Both had been colonial bishops prior to appointment.

In the [[Second World War]], the head of chaplaincy in the [[British Army]] was an ([[Anglican]]) chaplain-general, who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Symons, Chaplain-General to the Forces, 1939-44&lt;/ref&gt; An Assistant Chaplain-General was a Chaplain 1st class (full [[Colonel]]) and a senior Chaplain was a Chaplain 2nd class ([[Lieutenant Colonel]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brumwell, P. Middleton (1943) ''The Army Chaplain: the Royal Army Chaplains' Department; the duties of chaplains and morale''. London: Adam &amp; Charles Black&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 the first [[Bishop to the Forces]] was appointed; the Bishop is a suffragan of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the full title of the Bishop to the Forces is "The Archbishop of Canterbury's Episcopal Representative to the Armed Forces". The Bishop to the Forces is not a [[military chaplain]].&lt;ref name=crockfords100th&gt;''[[Crockford's Clerical Directory]] 2008/2009 (100th ed.)'', London: Church House Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7151-1030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current holder of the office is [[Nigel Stock (bishop)|Nigel Stock]], [[Bishop at Lambeth]]. There is sometimes confusion between the (Anglican) "Bishop ''to'' the Forces" and the (Roman Catholic) [[Bishopric of the Forces|"Bishop ''of'' the Forces"]]: for this reason the latter is normally given his title in full, i.e. "The Roman Catholic Bishop of the Forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/Catholic-Church/The-Church-in-England-and-Wales/bishopric_of_the_forces |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723200543/http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/Catholic-Church/The-Church-in-England-and-Wales/bishopric_of_the_forces |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df=dmy }}. ''The Catholic Church in England and Wales: the Bishopric of the Forces''. Retrieved on 9 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the three armed services has a chief chaplain (ranking as an archdeacon), for the navy the [[Chaplain of the Fleet]], for the army the Chaplain-General, and for the Royal Air Force the [[Chaplain-in-Chief]].&lt;ref&gt;''Whitaker's Almanack''; 1972; 1988. London: J. Whitaker &amp; Sons; pp. 459; (1988) 464&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum of Army Chaplaincy]] holds archive material and information relating to the history of the Chaplains General to the British Army both past and present.

==Outside Anglicanism==
[[Military Chaplain#Annual International Chiefs of Chaplains Conference|''Chaplain General'']] is also used as a term outside the Anglican Church, referring to the senior chaplain in a nation's military (sometimes called the ''Chief of Chaplains'', [[Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States|as in the United States military]]). Some nations, like [[South Africa]], [[Israel]], and [[Canada]], have one Chaplain General or Chief of Chaplains for the military as a whole; others, like the [[United States]], have one for each branch of the armed forces; while others have one for each major religion or faith group represented among its military personnel.

'''Christian culture''' is the [[cultural practice]]s common to [[Christianity]].  With the rapid expansion of Christianity to Europe, Syria, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Asia Minor]], Egypt, Ethiopia, and India and by the end of the 4th&amp;nbsp;century it had also become the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B.

[[Western culture]], throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as [[Cultural Christian|cultural Christians]]. The notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is "at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization'' by Thomas Woods, Jr. |url=http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/bookpage.asp?prod_cd=c6664 |work=National Review Book Service |accessdate=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire]]s, as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=Early Middle Ages|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=The Age of Enlightenment|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian culture guided the course of philosophy, literature, art, music and science.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0-8132-1683-6|edition=reprint|first2=Glenn |last2=Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian disciplines of the respective arts have subsequently developed into [[Christian philosophy]], [[Christian art]], [[Christian music]], [[Christian literature]] etc. Art and literature, law, education, and politics were preserved in the teachings of the Church, in an environment that, otherwise, would have probably seen their loss.

{{Main|Church architecture}}
[[File:Tomb of Jesus3.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Jesus]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre church]] in [[Jerusalem]].]]
The architecture of cathedrals, basilicas and abbey churches is characterised by the buildings' large scale and follows one of several branching traditions of form, function and style that all ultimately derive from the [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian architectural]] traditions established in the [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantinian]] period.

Cathedrals in particular, as well as many [[abbey]] churches and [[basilica]]s, have certain complex structural forms that are found less often in [[parish church]]es. They also tend to display a higher level of contemporary architectural style and the work of accomplished craftsmen, and occupy a status both ecclesiastical and social that an ordinary parish church does not have.  Such a cathedral or great church is generally one of the finest buildings within its region and is a focus of local pride. Many cathedrals and basilicas, and a number of abbey churches are among the world's most renowned works of architecture. These include [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Notre Dame de Paris]], [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Salisbury Cathedral]], [[Prague Cathedral]], [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the [[Basilica of St Denis]], the Basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Washington National Cathedral]], [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]], [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis]], Gaudí's incomplete [[Sagrada Familia]] and the ancient church of [[Hagia Sophia]], now a museum.

The earliest large churches date from [[Late Antiquity]]. As Christianity and the construction of churches and cathedrals spread throughout the world, their manner of building was dependent upon local materials and local techniques. Different [[Architectural style|styles of architecture]] developed and their fashion spread, carried by the establishment of monastic orders, by the posting of bishops from one region to another and by the travelling of master [[stonemason]]s who served as architects.&lt;ref&gt;John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles of the great church buildings are successively known as [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], various [[Victorian architecture|Revival]] styles of the late 18th to early 20th centuries and [[Modern architecture|Modern]].&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt; Overlaid on each of the academic styles are the regional characteristics. Some of these characteristics are so typical of a particular country or region that they appear, regardless of style, in the architecture of churches designed many centuries apart.&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt;

[[Christian art]] is [[sacred art]] which uses themes and imagery from Christianity. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' are the most common subjects, and scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most denominations.  Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam]] and [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism]].  However, there is also a considerable history of [[aniconism in Christianity]] from various periods.

===Illumination===
{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}

[[File:Armenian-manuscript-CIMG1727.JPG|thumb|upright|Armenian manuscript of 1053. Work of Johannes]]
An [[illuminated manuscript]] is a [[manuscript]] in which the [[Writing|text]] is supplemented by the addition of decoration. The earliest surviving substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period AD 400 to 600, primarily produced in Ireland, [[Constantinople]] and Italy. The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the 15th century [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from [[Late Antiquity]].

Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on [[papyrus]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on [[parchment]] (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called [[vellum]], traditionally made of unsplit [[calfskin]], though high quality parchment from other skins was also called ''parchment''.

===Iconography===
{{Main|Iconoclasm|Religious image|Christian icons|Christian symbolism}}

[[File:St. Theodor.jpg|thumb|upright|There are few old ceramic icons, such as this [[Theodore Stratelates|St. Theodor]] icon which dates to ca. 900 (from [[Preslav]], Bulgaria)]]
Christian art began, about two centuries after Christ, by borrowing motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art. [[Religious images]] are used to some extent by the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] Christian faith, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]]. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].

An [[icon]] is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from [[Orthodox Christianity]]. Christianity has used [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] from its very beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Symbolism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both East and West, numerous iconic types of Christ, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.

[[Christian symbolism]] invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. Christianity has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. [[Religious symbolism]] is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and [[Panagia]] types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s. Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

Each [[saint]] has a story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of Christian [[saint]]s are traditionally represented by a symbol or [[Icon|iconic motif]] associated with their life, termed an attribute or [[emblem]], in order to identify them. The study of these forms part of [[iconography]] in [[Art history]].

=== Eastern Christian art ===
{{main|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|upright|6th? century [[icon]] of [[Christ Pantocrator]], a very rare pre-[[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] icon.]]
The dedication of [[Constantinople]] as capital in 330 AD created a great new Christian artistic centre for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which soon became a separate political unit. Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, [[Constantius II]], included the original foundations of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Mathews, ''The early churches of Constantinople: architecture and liturgy'' (University Park, 1971); N. Henck, "Constantius ho Philoktistes?", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 55 (2001), 279–304 ([http://www.doaks.org/DOP55/DP55ch14.pdf available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327035204/http://www.doaks.org/DOP55/DP55ch14.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Western Roman Empire]] disintegrated and was taken over by "barbarian" peoples, the art of the Byzantine Empire reached levels of sophistication, power and artistry not previously seen in Christian art, and set the standards for those parts of the West still in touch with Constantinople.
[[File:Rhodes Siana2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright|Church of Agios Panteleimonos, Greece.]]
This achievement was checked by the controversy over the use of ''graven images'', and the proper interpretation of the Second Commandment, which led to the crisis of [[Byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] or destruction of religious images, which racked the Empire between 726 and 843. The restoration of Orthodoxy resulted in a strict standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]. Byzantine art became increasingly conservative, as the form of images themselves, many accorded [[Acheiropoieta|divine origin]] or thought to have been be painted by [[Saint Luke]] or other figures, was held to have a status not far off that of a scriptural text. They could be copied, but not improved upon. As a concession to Iconoclast sentiment, monumental religious sculpture was effectively banned. Neither of these attitudes were held in Western Europe, but Byzantine art nonetheless had great influence there until the [[High Middle Ages]], and remained very popular long after that, with vast numbers of icons of the [[Cretan School]] exported to Europe as late as the [[Renaissance]]. Where possible, Byzantine artists were borrowed for projects such as mosaics in [[Venice]] and [[Palermo]]. The enigmatic frescoes at [[Castelseprio]] may be an example of work by a Greek artist working in Italy.

The art of [[Eastern Catholicism]] has always been rather closer to the Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in countries near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences. The [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] may well have been of Byzantine origin – it has been repainted and this is hard to tell. Other images that are certainly of Greek origin, like the [[Salus Populi Romani]] and [[Our Lady of Perpetual Help]], both icons in Rome, have been subjects of specific veneration for centuries.

Although the influence has often been resisted, especially in Russia, Catholic art has also affected Orthodox depictions in many respects, especially in countries like Romania, and in the post-Byzantine [[Cretan School]], which led [[Greek Orthodox]] art under Venetian rule in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[El Greco]] left Crete when relatively young, but [[Michael Damaskinos]] returned after a brief period in Venice, and was able to switch between Italian and Greek styles. Even the traditionalist [[Theophanes the Cretan]], working mainly on [[Mount Athos]], nevertheless shows unmistakable Western influence.

Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward. A number of states contemporary with the [[Byzantine Empire]] were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]"). These included [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], and the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], as well as some non-Orthodox states like the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. Art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] is often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

=== Roman Catholic art ===
{{main|Roman Catholic art}}
[[File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|thumb|upright|Bernini's ''Ecstasy of Saint Theresa'']]
[[Roman Catholic art]] consists of all visual works produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]. This includes sculpture, painting, mosaics, metalwork, embroidery and even architecture. Catholic art has played a leading role in the history and development of Western Art since at least the fourth century. The principal subject matter of Catholic Art has been the life and times of [[Jesus Christ]], along with those of his disciples, the saints, and the events of the Jewish [[Old Testament]].

The earliest surviving art works are the painted frescoes on the walls of the [[catacomb]]s and meeting houses of the persecuted Christians of the Roman Empire. The Christian Church in Rome was influenced by the Roman style of art and the religious Christian artists of the time. The stone [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of Roman Christians exhibit the earliest surviving carved statuary of Jesus, Mary and other biblical figures. The legalisation of Christianity transformed Catholic art, which adopted richer forms such as [[mosaics]] and illuminated manuscripts. The [[iconoclasm]] controversy briefly divided the eastern and western churches, after which artistic development progressed in separate directions. [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] flowered in the Western Church as the style of painting and statuary moved in an increasingly naturalistic direction. The Protestant Reformation produced new waves of image-destruction, to which the Church responded with the dramatic and emotive [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles. In the 19th century the leadership in western art moved away from the Catholic Church which, after embracing historical revivalism was increasingly affected by the modernist movement, a movement that in its "rebellion" against nature, counters the Church's emphasis on nature as a good creation of God.

Renaissance artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Titian]], were among a multitude of innovative virtuosos sponsored by the Church.&lt;ref name="Duffy133"&gt;Duffy, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

British art historian [[Kenneth Clark]] wrote that Western Europe's first "great age of civilisation" was ready to begin around the year 1000. From 1100, he wrote, monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living during the period. [[Abbot Suger]] of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: "The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material". Clarke calls this "the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today".&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"&gt;[[Kenneth Clarke]]; ''Civilisation'', BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during [[The Renaissance]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Catholic artists produced many of the unsurpassed masterpieces of [[Western art]] – often inspired by Biblical themes: from Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' and ''[[Pietà]]'' sculptures, to Da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' and Raphael's various ''Madonna'' paintings. Referring to a "great outburst of creative energy such as took place in Rome between 1620 and 1660", Kenneth Clarke wrote:&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ith a single exception, the great artists of the time were all sincere, conforming Christians. [[Guercino]] spent much of his mornings in prayer; [[Bernini]] frequently went into retreats and practised the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]]; [[Rubens]] attended Mass every morning before beginning work. The exception was [[Caravaggio]], who was like the hero of a modern play, except that he happened to paint very well.

This conformism was not based on fear of the Inquisition, but on the perfectly simple belief that the faith which had inspired the great saints of the preceding generation was something by which a man should regulate his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Protestant art ===
[[File:Hans Holbein d. J. 017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''Noli me tangere'' a relatively rare Protestant oil painting of Christ from the Reformation period. It is small, and generally naturalistic in style, avoiding iconic elements like the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], which is barely discernible.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

Prominent painters with Protestant background were, for example, [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. World literature was enriched by the works of [[Edmund Spenser]], [[John Milton]], [[John Bunyan]], [[John Donne]], [[John Dryden]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]], [[Theodor Fontane]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Emily Brontë]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Thomas Stearns Eliot]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[William Faulkner]], [[John Updike]], and many others.

== Music ==
{{Main|Christian music}}
[[Christian music]] is music that has been written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding Christian life and faith. Common themes of Christian music include [[praise]], [[worship]], [[penitence]], and [[lament]], and its forms vary widely across the world.

Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian music varies according to culture and social context. Christian music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace.

In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;Murray, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of Catholic composers and Catholic sacred music which have a prominent place in Western culture is extensive, but includes [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]''; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Ave verum corpus]]''; [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Ave Maria]]'', [[César Franck]]'s ''[[Panis angelicus]]'', and [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]]''.

[[Martin Luther]], [[Paul Gerhardt]], [[George Wither]], [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], and many other authors and composers created well-known church hymns. Musicians like [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frederick Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]] composed great works of music.

==Literature and poetry ==
{{Main|Christian literature|Christian poetry}}
[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|200px|thumbnail|[[Gutenberg Bible]]. The [[Bible]] was [[Authorship of the Bible|authored]] by Jews during the [[Iron Age]]s and the [[Classical era]]. It comprise cultural values, basic human values, mythology and religious beliefs of both Judaism and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature|title=biblical literature|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Christian literature]] is writing that deals with Christian themes and incorporates the Christian world view. This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. [[Christian poetry]] is any poetry that contains Christian teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide [[allegory]].

While falling within the strict definition of literature, the Bible is not generally considered literature. However, the Bible has been treated and appreciated as literature; the [[Bible]] is a corner stone of Western civilization.&lt;ref name="Perry2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin Perry|title=Western Civilization: A Brief History, Volume I: To 1789|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2pnv0Aoh2EC&amp;pg=PA33|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-83720-1|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Version]] in particular has long been considered a masterpiece of English prose, whatever may be thought of its religious significance. The Authorized Version has been called "the most influential version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language", "the most important book in English religion and culture", and "the most celebrated book in the [[English-speaking world]]". [[David Crystal]] has estimated that it is responsible for 257 idioms in English, examples include [[feet of clay]] and [[wikt:sow the wind, reap the whirlwind|reap the whirlwind]]. Furthermore, prominent [[atheist]] figures such as the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have praised the King James Version as being "a giant step in the maturing of English literature" and "a great work of literature", respectively, with Dawkins then adding, "A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2011/05/hitchens-201105?currentPage=all|title=When the King Saved God|year=2011|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=10 August 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/19/richard-dawkins-king-james-bible|title=Why I want all our children to read the King James Bible|date=20 May 2012|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate= 10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several retellings of the Bible, or parts of the Bible, have also been made with the aim of emphasising its literary qualities.

[[File:Saints of the Golden Legend collage.jpg|200px|thumbnail|The stories of the saints which are preserved in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'']]
In [[Byzantine literature]], four different cultural elements are recognised: the [[Greek literature|Greek]], the Christian, the [[Latin literature|Roman]], and the Oriental. Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists, encyclopaedists (Patriarch Photios, [[Michael Psellus]], and [[Michael Choniates]] are regarded as the greatest encyclopaedists of Byzantium) and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the ''[[Digenis Acritas]]''. The remaining two groups include the new literary species: ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.&lt;ref name="Mango275–276"&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|2007|pp=275–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And it was in [[Alexandria]] that Graeco-Oriental Christianity had its birth. There the [[Septuagint]] translation had been made; there that that fusion of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion took place which culminated in [[Philo]]; there flourished the mystic speculative [[Neoplatonism]] associated with [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry of Tyros|Porphyry]]. At Alexandria the great Greek ecclesiastical writers worked alongside pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; several were born here, e.g. [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and his opponent [[Arius]], also [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] and [[Synesius]]. On Egyptian soil [[monasticism]] began and thrived. After Alexandria, [[Antioch]] held great prestige, where a school of Christian commentators flourished under [[St. John Chrysostom]] and where later arose the Christian universal chronicles. In surrounding Syria, we find the germs of Greek ecclesiastical poetry, while from neighboring [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] came [[St. John of Damascus]], one of the [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]].

The list of Catholic authors and literary works is vast. With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible and [[Papal Encyclicals]] have been constants of the Catholic canon but countless other historical works may be listed as noteworthy in terms of their influence on Western society. From late Antiquity, [[St Augustine]]'s book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography of ever written in the canon of [[Western Literature]]. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview. The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written 1265–1274, is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225–1274), and although unfinished, "one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, James F., "Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.) Jorge J. E. Gracia, Gregory M. Reichberg, Bernard N. Schumacher (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), p. 165. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jAcwGItzssC&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;ots=MXldxkl9sr&amp;dq=james%20f%20ross%20philosopher&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended as a manual for beginners in theology and a compendium of all of the main [[theology|theological]] teachings of the Church. It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The epic poetry of the Italian [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of the late [[Middle Ages]] is also considered immensely influential. The English statesman and philosopher, [[Thomas More]], wrote the seminal work [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] in 1516. [[St Ignatius Loyola]], a key figure in the Catholic counter-reformation, is the author of an influential book of meditations known as the ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]''.

== Philosophy==
{{Main|Christian philosophy|Scholasticism}}
[[File:Augustine Confessiones.jpg|thumb|upright|''Confessions'' by St. [[Augustine of Hippo]]]]
[[Christian philosophy]] is a term to describe the fusion of various fields of philosophy with the [[Theology|theological]] doctrines of Christianity. [[Scholasticism]], which means "that [which] belongs to the school", and was a method of learning taught by the [[academics]] (or ''school people'') of medieval universities c. 1100–1500. Scholasticism originally started to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. Scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].

Medieval philosophy is the philosophy of Western Europe and the Middle East during the [[Middle Ages]], roughly extending from the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]] until the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume II: From Augustine to Scotus'' (Burns &amp; Oates, 1950), p. 1, dates medieval philosophy proper from the Carolingian Renaissance in the eighth century to the end of the fourteenth century, though he includes [[Augustine]] and the Patristic fathers as precursors. Desmond Henry, in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967), vol. 5, pp. 252–257, starts with Augustine and ends with [[Nicole Oresme|Nicholas of Oresme]] in the late fourteenth century. David Luscombe, ''Medieval Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), dates medieval philosophy from the conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in 312 to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1520s. Christopher Hughes, in A.C. Grayling (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), covers philosophers from Augustine to Ockham. Jorge J.E. Gracia, in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2003), p. 620, identifies medieval philosophy as running from Augustine to [[John of St. Thomas]] in the seventeenth century. Anthony Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy, Volume II: Medieval Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), begins with Augustine and ends with the Lateran Council of 1512.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines of [[Abrahamic religion]] ([[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and Christianity) with [[secularism|secular]] learning.

The history of western European medieval philosophy is traditionally divided into two main periods: the period in the [[Latin West]] following the [[Early Middle Ages]] until the 12th century, when the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] were preserved and cultivated; and the "golden age" of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries in the Latin West, which witnessed the culmination of the recovery of ancient philosophy, and significant developments in the field of [[philosophy of religion]], [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]].
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|upright|''Summa theologica'', Pars secunda, prima pars. (copy by Peter Schöffer, 1471)]]
The medieval era was disparagingly treated by the Renaissance humanists, who saw it as a barbaric "middle" period between the classical age of Greek and Roman culture, and the "rebirth" or ''renaissance'' of classical culture. Yet this period of nearly a thousand years was the longest period of philosophical development in Europe, and possibly the richest. [[Jorge Gracia]] has argued that "in intensity, sophistication, and achievement, the philosophical flowering in the thirteenth century could be rightly said to rival the golden age of Greek philosophy in the fourth century B.C."&lt;ref name="gracia"&gt;Gracia, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.

Philosophers from the Middle Ages include the Christian philosophers [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Jean Buridan]]; the Jewish philosophers [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]; and the [[Muslim]] philosophers [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], [[Al-Farabi|Alfarabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]], [[Ibn Bajjah|Avempace]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]], [[Ibn Khaldūn]], and [[Averroes]]. The medieval tradition of [[Scholasticism]] continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as [[Francisco Suarez]] and [[John of St. Thomas]].

Aquinas, father of [[Thomism]], was immensely influential in Catholic Europe, placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. His work was a significant departure from the [[Neoplatonic]] and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism.

The Renaissance ("rebirth") was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought,&lt;ref name="contemporaries"&gt;Charles Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 5, loosely define the period as extending "from the age of Ockham to the revisionary work of Bacon, Descartes and their contemporaries."&lt;/ref&gt; in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism.&lt;ref name="renaissance3"&gt;Brian Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 4: "one may identify the hallmark of Renaissance philosophy as an accelerated and enlarged interest, stimulated by newly available texts, in primary sources of Greek and Roman thought that were previously unknown or partially known or little read."&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as [[humanism]].&lt;ref name="transmission"&gt;Jorge J.E. Gracia in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2002), p. 621: "the humanists … restored man to the centre of attention and channeled their efforts to the recovery and transmission of classical learning, particularly in the philosophy of Plato."&lt;/ref&gt; Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed [[Petrarch]] in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy.&lt;ref name="intellectual"&gt;Charles B. Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 61 and 63: "From Petrarch the early humanists learnt their conviction that the revival of ''humanae literae'' was only the first step in a greater intellectual renewal" […] "the very conception of philosophy was changing because its chief object was now man—man was at centre of every inquiry".&lt;/ref&gt;

These new movements in philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations in Europe: the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the decline of [[feudalism]].  Though the theologians of the Protestant Reformation showed little direct interest in philosophy, their destruction of the traditional foundations of theological and intellectual authority harmonized with a revival of [[fideism]] and skepticism in thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[Montaigne]], and [[Francisco Sanches]].&lt;ref name="scepticism"&gt;Richard Popkin, ''The History of Scepticism from Savonarola to Bayle'' (Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the gradual centralization of political power in nation-states was echoed by the emergence of secular political philosophies, as in the works of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (often described as the first modern political thinker, or a key turning point towards modern political thinking), [[Thomas More]], [[Erasmus]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Jean Bodin]], and [[Hugo Grotius]].&lt;ref name="renaissance5"&gt;Copenhaver and Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 274–284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="renaissance6"&gt;Schmitt and Skinner, ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 430–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref name=habgood&gt;''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills &amp; Brown, 1964, pp., 11, 14–16, 48–55, 68–69, 90–91, 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --&gt; Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], beauty and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation.

Despite some opposition to pagan learning, many of the most distinguished classical scholars held high office in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Church]]. &lt;ref&gt; Some noteworthy exceptions to this tolerance include the closing of the [[Platonic Academy]] in 529; the [[obscurantism]] of [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]; and the condemnations of [[Ioannis Italos]] and [[George Gemistos Plethon|Georgios Plethon]] for their devotion to ancient philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of antiquity never ceased to be cultivated in the [[Byzantine empire]] due to the impetus given to [[classical studies]] by the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] of Athens in the 4th and 5th centuries, the vigor of the philosophical academy of [[Alexandria]], and to the services of the [[University of Constantinople]], which concerned itself entirely with secular subjects, to the exclusion of [[theology]],&lt;ref&gt;The faculty was composed exclusively of philosophers, scientists, rhetoricians, and [[philology|philologists]] ({{cite book | last=Tatakes |first=Vasileios N. |author2=Moutafakis, Nicholas J. | title=Byzantine Philosophy | year=2003 | publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=0-87220-563-0|pages=189}})&lt;/ref&gt; which was taught in the [[Halki seminary|Patriarchical Academy]]. Even the latter offered instruction in the ancient classics, and included literary, philosophical, and scientific texts in its curriculum. The monastic schools concentrated upon the [[Bible]], theology, and [[liturgy]]. Therefore, the monastic [[scriptoria]] expended most of their efforts upon the transcription of ecclesiastical manuscripts, while ancient-pagan literature was transcribed, summarized, excerpted, and annotated by laymen or clergy like [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]], [[Arethas of Caesarea]], [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], and [[Basilius Bessarion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anastos|first=Milton V.|authorlink=|year=1962|title=The History of Byzantine Science.

In late Byzantium (9th to 12th century) mathematicians like [[Michael Psellos]] considered mathematics as a way to interpret the world.

[[Middle Eastern Christians]] especially the adherents of the [[Church of the East]] ([[Nestorian]]s), contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the [[Ummayads|Ummayad]] and the [[Abbasids|Abbasid]] periods by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] to [[Syriac Language|Syriac]] and afterwards to [[Arabic Language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Hill, Donald 1993. p.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of the Middle Ages|author=Brague, Rémi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c8YjEkLPXNYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780226070803#v=onepage&amp;q=House%20of%20Wisdom&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 February 2014|isbn=9780226070803|page=164|date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 4th through the 7th centuries, scholarly work in the Syriac and Greek languages was either newly initiated, or carried on from the Hellenistic period.

While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]].  For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 [[John Paul II]], then pope of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Church on Western letters and learning has been formidable. The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.

One view, first propounded by [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophers]], asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. [[Communist states]] have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].

The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were [[Jesuit]]s, have been among the leading lights in [[astronomy]], [[genetics]], [[geomagnetism]], [[meteorology]], [[seismology]], and [[solar physics]], becoming some of the "fathers" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the [[Augustinian]] abbot [[Gregor Mendel]] (pioneer in the study of genetics), [[Roger Bacon]] (a [[Franciscan]] friar who was one of the early advocates of the [[scientific method]]), and Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]] (the first to propose the [[Big Bang]] theory). Other notable priest scientists have included [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Nicholas Steno]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giambattista Riccioli]], [[Roger Boscovich]], and [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:[[Henri Becquerel]] who discovered [[radioactivity]]; [[Galvani]], [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]], [[Ampere]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]], pioneers in electricity and [[telecommunications]]; [[Lavoisier]], "father of modern [[chemistry]]"; [[Vesalius]], founder of modern [[human anatomy]]; and [[Cauchy]], one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of [[calculus]].

Throughout history many of the [[List of Roman Catholic cleric-scientists|Roman Catholic clerics]] have made contributions to science, mostly during periods of Church domination of public life. These cleric-scientists include [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Georges Lemaître]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], [[Nicole Oresme]], [[Jean Buridan]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Christopher Clavius]], [[Nicolas Steno]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], [[William of Ockham]], and others.

==== Jesuit in science ====
{{Main|List of Jesuit scientists}}

The Jesuits have made numerous significant contributions to the development of science. For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to earthquakes, and [[seismology]] has been described as "the Jesuit science".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Elizabeth Hough, ''Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man'', Princeton University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-691-12807-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvmDeAxEiO8C&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits have been described as "the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David C.|last1=Lindberg|first2=Ronald Leslie|last2=Numbers|authorlink1=David C.

They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on [[Jupiter]]'s surface, the Andromeda nebula and Saturn's rings.

Protestantism had an important influence on science. According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Puritanism]] and [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), ''Robert King Merton'', in ''[[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], [[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]], Malden, Massachusetts Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|9781405105958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory, Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–660&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study God's influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003/&gt;

According of ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United State'' by [[Harriet Zuckerman]], a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] Laureates, have identified from [[Protestant]] background.&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HAHCzJfmD5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Scientific+Elite:+Nobel+Laureates+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMIxKistOqUxwIVzNUUCh0pGgC-#v=onepage&amp;q=Scientific%20Elite%3A%20Nobel%20Laureates%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States]'' New York, The Free Pres, 1977, p.68: Protestants turn up among the American-reared laureates in slightly greater proportion to their numbers in the general population.

== Education ==

[[File:Georgetown Jesuit Residence.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|Students studying outside Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence in [[Georgetown University]]]]
The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] setting.&lt;ref name="Rüegg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verger1999"/&gt; Prior to the establishment of universities, European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s (''Scholae monasticae''), in which [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): "Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;126–7, 282–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Missionary activity for the Catholic Church has always incorporated education of evangelized peoples as part of its social ministry. History shows that in evangelized lands, the first people to operate schools were Roman Catholics. In some countries, the Church is the main provider of education or significantly supplements government forms of education. Presently, the Church operates the world's largest non-governmental school system.&lt;ref name="Gardner148"&gt;Gardner, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Western Civilization's most influential universities were founded by the Catholic Church.
[[File:Xaviers college.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|The Catholic [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier's College in Mumbai]], is one of the most prestigious liberal arts colleges in India]]
The Catholic Church founded the West's first universities, which were preceded by the schools attached to monasteries and cathedrals, and generally staffed by monks and friars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Universities began springing up in Italian towns like [[Salerno University|Salerno]], which became a leading medical school, translating the work of Greek and Arabic physicians into Latin. [[Bologna University]] became the most influential of the early universities, which first specialised in [[canon law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. [[Paris University]], specialising in such topics as theology, came to rival Bologna under the supervision of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. [[Oxford University]] in England later came rival Paris in Theology and [[Salamanca University]] was founded in Spain in 1243. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the universities benefitted from the use of Latin, the common language of the Church, and its internationalist reach, and their role was to "teach, argue and reason within a Christian framework".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost. Compulsory education for both boys and girls was introduced. For example, the [[Puritans]] who established [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1628 founded [[Harvard College]] only eight years later. About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century, including [[Yale University]] (1701). [[Pennsylvania]] also became a centre of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 69–80, 88–89, 114–117, 186–188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Schmidt, ''Kongregationalismus'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band III (1959), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1770&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Princeton University]] was a [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterian]] foundation. Protestantism also initiated translations of the Bible into national languages and hereby supported the development of national literatures.

A large number of [[mainline Protestant]]s have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country's leading institutes of higher education.&lt;ref name=mainline2000&gt;McKinney, William. "Mainline Protestantism 2000." ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 558, Americans and Religions in the Twenty-First Century (July 1998), pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ivy League]] universities have strong [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] historical ties, and their influence continues today. Until about World War II, Ivy League universities were composed largely of WASP students.

According to [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income, about (59%) of American [[Anglican]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and post-graduate degree, and about (56%) of [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] and (47%) of [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] and (46%) [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and post-graduate degree.

A [[Pew Center]] study about [[Religiosity and education|religion and education]] around the world in 2016, found that Christians ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world after [[Jews]] with an average of 9.3 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=19 December 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest of years of schooling among Christians found in Germany (13.6),&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; New Zealand (13.5)&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and Estonia (13.1).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Christians were also found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and post-graduate degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Between the various [[World Christianity|Christian communities]], Singapore outranks other nations in terms of Christians who obtain a university degree in institutions of higher education (67%),&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; followed by the [[Christianity in Israel|Christians of Israel]] (63%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bokra.net/Article-1155836 |title=  المسيحيون العرب يتفوقون على يهود إسرائيل في التعليم |website=Bokra |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Christianity in Georgia (country)|Christians of Georgia]] (57%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;
According to the study, Christians in North America, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and Asia-Pacific regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian Churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;
According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their Christian counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

== Medicine and health care ==
[[File:SantaMariaDellaScalaSienaBack.JPG|thumb|upright|Panorama of Siena's [[Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)|Santa Maria della Scala Hospital]], one of Europe's oldest hospitals]]
The administration of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires split and the [[Fall of Rome|demise of the Western Empire]] by the sixth century was accompanied by a series of violent invasions and precipitated the collapse of cities and civic institutions of learning, along with their links to the learning of classical Greece and Rome. For the next thousand years, medical knowledge would change very little.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp82-83&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarly medical tradition maintained itself in the more stable East, but in the West, scholarship virtually disappeared outside of the Church, where monks were aware of a dwindling range of medical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitality was considered an obligation of Christian charity and bishops' houses and the valetudinaria of wealthier Christians were used to tend the sick. And the legacy of this early period was, in the words of Porter, that "Christianity planted the hospital: the well-endowed establishments of the Levant and the scattered houses of the West shared a common religious ethos of charity." 

The [[Byzantine Empire]] was one of the first empires to have flourishing medical establishments. Prior to the Byzantine Empire the Roman Empire had [[hospitals]] specifically for soldiers and slaves. However, none of these establishments were for the public. The hospitals in Byzantium were originally started by the church to act as a place for the poor to have access to basic amenities. Hospitals were usually separated between men and women. Although the remains of these hospitals have not been discovered by archaeologists, recordings of hospitals from the Byzantine Empire describe large buildings that had the core feature of an open hearth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Hospital in the Byzantine Empire|last=Miller|first=Timothy|publisher=Johns Hopkins|year=1985|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishments of the Byzantine Empire resembled the beginning of what we now know as modern hospitals. The first hospital was erected by Leontius of Antioch between the years 344 to 358 and was a place for strangers and migrants to find refuge. Around the same time, a deacon named Marathonius was in charge of hospitals and monasteries in Constantinople. His main objective was to improve urban aesthetics, illustrating hospitals as a main part of Byzantine cities. These early hospitals were designed for the poor. In fact, most hospitals throughout the Byzantine Empire were almost exclusively utilized by the poor. This may be due to descriptions of hospitals similar to "[[Gregory of Nazianzus|Gregory Nazianzen]] who called the hospital a stairway to heaven, implying that it aimed only to ease death for the chronically or terminally ill rather than promote recovery".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Hospital in the Byzantine Empire|last=Miller|first=Timothy|publisher=Johns Hopkins|year=1985|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate between scholars as to why these institutions were started by the church. Many scholars believe that the church founded hospitals in order to receive additional donations. Whatever the case for these hospitals, they began to diffuse across the empire. Soon after, [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil of Caesarea]] developed a place for the sick in which provided refuge for the sick and homeless.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horden|first=Peregrine|date=2005|title=The Earliest Hospitals in Byzantium, Western Europe, and Islam|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1404975.files/Final%20Exam%20Readings/Horden-Earliest%20Hospitals-2005.pdf|journal=MIT Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hunger and sickness Madras.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco|Salesian sister]] caring for sick and poor in former [[Madras Presidency]]. Catholic women have been heavily involved as care givers]]
Geoffrey Blainey likened the Catholic Church in its activities during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for monks and clerics to practice medicine and medical students in northern European universities often took minor Holy orders. Mediaeval hospitals had a strongly Christian ethos, and were, in the words of historian of medicine [[Roy Porter]], "religious foundations through and through", and Ecclesiastical regulations were passed to govern medicine, partly to prevent clergymen profiting from medicine.&lt;ref name="Present pp. 110-112"&gt;[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 110-112&lt;/ref&gt;  During Europe's [[Age of Discovery]], Catholic missionaries, notably the Jesuits, introduced the modern sciences to India, China and Japan. While persecutions continue to limit the spread of Catholic institutions to some Middle Eastern Muslim nations, and such places as the People's Republic of China and North Korea, elsewhere in Asia the church is a major provider of health care services - especially in Catholic Nations like the [[Philippines]].

Today he [[Roman Catholic Church]] is the largest non-government provider of [[health care]] services in the world.&lt;ref name=Geopolitics&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnew|first=John|title=Deus Vult: The Geopolitics of Catholic Church|journal=Geopolitics|date=12 February 2010|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.1080/14650040903420388}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has around 18,000 clinics, 16,000 homes for the elderly and those with special needs, and 5,500 hospitals, with 65 percent of them located in developing countries.&lt;ref name="World Development p.40"&gt;[[Robert Calderisi]]; ''Earthly Mission - The Catholic Church and World Development''; TJ International Ltd; 2013; p.40&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Church's [[Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers]] said that the Church manages 26% of the world's health care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_hospitals_represent_26_percent_of_worlds_health_facilities_reports_pontifical_council/ |title=Catholic hospitals comprise one quarter of world's healthcare, council reports :: Catholic News Agency (CNA) |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's involvement in health care has ancient origins.

[[Francisco de Vitoria]], a disciple of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and a Catholic thinker who studied the issue regarding the human rights of colonized natives, is recognized by the United Nations as a father of international law, and now also by historians of economics and democracy as a leading light for the West's democracy and rapid economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Philosophical and Historical Analysis of Modern Democracy, Equality, and Freedom Under the Influence of Christianity |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0010.html |last=de Torre |first=Fr. Joseph M. |year=1997 |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Schumpeter]], an economist of the twentieth century, referring to the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]], wrote, "it is they who come nearer than does any other group to having been the 'founders' of scientific economics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Economic Analysis |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |year=1954 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists and historians, such as Raymond de Roover, Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson, and Alejandro Chafuen, have also made similar statements. 

The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties, including the power of reason. That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way.

[[File:Nativity tree2011.jpg|thumb|right|A [[nativity scene|depiction of the Nativity]] with a [[Christmas tree]] backdrop.]]
Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the [[liturgical year]]. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of [[parament]]s and [[vestment]]s for clergy,&lt;ref name="calendar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fortescue|first1=Adrian|title=Christian Calendar|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03158a.htm|website=The Catholic Encyclopedia.|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=18 July 2014|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.

Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="calendar" /&gt; and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective [[Rite#Christian|rites]]. Calendars set aside holy days, such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or Mary, the [[saint]]s, periods of [[fasting]] such as [[Lent]], and other pious events such as [[memoria]] or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as Christmas, Easter and [[Pentecost]]: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The seven Sacrament.jpg|thumb|The seven sacraments of the Catholic church: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]], [[Marriage (Catholic Church)|Matrimony]], [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]], [[Holy orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]] and the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]].]]
Roman Catholic theology enumerates seven sacraments:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1210] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042152/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |date=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baptism]] ([[infant baptism|Christening]]), [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] (Chrismation), [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]] (Communion), [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] (Reconciliation), [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] (before the [[Second Vatican Council]] generally called Extreme Unction), [[Marriage (Catholic Church)|Matrimony]]

In Christian belief and practice, a ''sacrament'' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that mediates [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions.&lt;ref name="ODCC1435"&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the Orthodox tradition), [[Holy orders]] ([[ordination]]), [[Penance]] (or [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), [[Anointing of the Sick]], and [[Matrimony]] (see [[Christian views on marriage]]).&lt;ref name="ODCC1435" /&gt;

Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognized by churches in the [[High Church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], many [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]], and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.&lt;ref name="ODCC1435" /&gt; [[Christian denominations]], such as [[Baptists]], which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]'' rather than sacraments.

Today, most [[Christian denominations]] are neutral about [[religious male circumcision]], neither requiring it nor forbidding it. The practice is customary among the [[Coptic Christian|Coptic]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Ethiopian]], and [[Eritrean Orthodox]] Churches, and also some other African churches.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Customary in some Coptic and other churches:
*"The Coptic Christians in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians— two of the oldest surviving forms of Christianity— retain many of the features of early Christianity, including male circumcision. Circumcision is not prescribed in other forms of Christianity... Some Christian churches in South Africa oppose the practice, viewing it as a pagan ritual, while others, including the Nomiya church in Kenya, require circumcision for membership and participants in focus group discussions in Zambia and Malawi mentioned similar beliefs that Christians should practice circumcision since Jesus was circumcised and the Bible teaches the practice."
*"The decision that Christians need not practice circumcision is recorded in {{Bibleverse|Acts|15}}; there was never, however, a prohibition of circumcision, and it is practiced by Coptic Christians." [https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054046/http://bartleby.com/65/ci/circumci.html "circumcision"], The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

The same sequence of events happens three times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the [[New Testament]] does give a few guidelines about the consumption of meat, practiced by the [[Christian Church]] today; one of these is not consuming food knowingly offered to pagan [[Idolatry|idols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2002 |title=The Weaker Brother |journal=Third Way Magazine |volume=25 |issue=10 |page=25 |quote=Christ came for the Gentiles as well as the Jews (the real meaning of that vision in Acts 10:9;16) but he also calls us to look out for each other and not do things that will cause our brothers and sisters to stumble.

'''Cosmography''' is the science that [[map]]s the general features of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]], describing both [[heaven]] and [[Earth]] (but without encroaching on [[geography]] or [[astronomy]]). The 14th-century work ''[['Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat]]'' by [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] is considered to be an early work of cosmography.

Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmography schematize a universe centered on [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by rivers, continents and seas.  These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.
[[File:Peasants spinning.png|thumb|left|Sedentary Occupations of Peasants&lt;!---Facsimile from 
an Engraving on Wood, attributed to---&gt; &amp;ndash; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], in the "Cosmographie" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]]
In 1551, [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], from [[Zaragoza]], Spain, published ''[[Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar]]''. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

[[Peter Heylin]]'s 1652 book ''Cosmographie'' (enlarged from his ''Microcosmos'' of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of [[Australia]] and among the first of [[California]]. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]'', including Australia, and extending to [[Utopia]], [[Álfheimr|Fairyland]], and the "Land of [[Chivalry|Chivalrie]]".

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive ''Compendious Description of the Whole World'', which also included a [[chronology]] of world events from [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] forward. These were all part of a major trend in the [[European Renaissance]] to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

The word was also commonly used by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his lectures.

In [[astrophysics]], the term "cosmography" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|matter distribution]] and [[kinematics]] of the [[universe|observable universe]], dependent on the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] but independent of the temporal dependence of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1652">In [[social theory]], '''detraditionalization''' refers to the erosion of [[tradition]] in religion ([[Secularization]], [[agnosticism]], [[Religious disaffiliation]]) and society in ([[postmodernism|post]])[[modernism]].

Traditional societies belief in established, timeless, authoritative orders and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], above the [[individual]], and timeless attainable goals.

Factors that contribute to ''loss of tradition'' are endorsement of individual [[choice]] and responsibility or the "sacred" (in [[Émile Durkheim]]'s sense of the term) individual itself in [[democracy|democratic]] societies, and the revolution in [[Information and communications technology|communications]]. Among the theorists who believe that society is [[social change|moving]] from a modernity that has been largely traditional to a post-traditional time is [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens]].

[[File:Oscar II, Svensk porträttgalleri.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in a pre-1900 photograph.]]
'''Dissenter Acts''' ({{lang-sv|Dissenterlagarna}}) were laws, enacted by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]] with the consent of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]], which gave [[nonconformism|nonconformist]]s who wanted to leave the then established [[Church of Sweden]] the right to do so, provided that the [[dissenter]]s then joined one of the state-approved denominations. The first such edict was decreed in 1860 by [[Charles XV of Sweden|Karl XV]] and the ''[[Riksdag of the Estates|Ståndsriksdag]]''; the second one in 1873 by [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] and the reorganized bicameral ''[[History of the Riksdag|Riksdag]]''. Neither the ''Ståndsriksdag'', divided into four Estates, nor the newer ''Riksdag'' could be said to be truly democratic, though, as the [[suffrage]] was restricted to males who owned property. The 1873 edict remained in force until the 1951 Religious Freedom Act (''religionsfrihetslag''); the Church of Sweden remained the established state church until 2000.

Despite the enactment of the Dissenter Acts, nonconformists were still required to financially support the then established Church of Sweden:

:The state religion is the Evangelical Lutheran doctrine, in the sense that the churches which have concurred in this creed are described as a state church, placed under the king's (government's) "supervision, care and defence," for which the state so defines its constitution and economy that the King and his Cabinet Council determines the religion. This religion is taught in state schools and has special constitutional protection; furthermore, its clergy constitute an Estate of the realm. There shall be a Board of Education to which the king will appoint church officials. '''Holidays of the state church shall be respected even by adherents of foreign creeds, who also must contribute to its expenses.''' The king and parliament participate in the establishment of canon law; the king establishes the church bylaws. It has even happened that His Royal Majesty has contributed government funds to reward preachers who have countered heterodox dissenters. The king is ''summus episcopus'' (archbishop), the Church's head and governor (''cujus est regio, illius est religio'', "The religion of a country is that of its ruler"), with a territorial system as opposed to hierarchical and self-governing systems.&lt;ref name="hagman"&gt;"''Statsreligion är den ev.-lutherska läran så till vida, att det kyrkosamfund, som anslutit sig till denna trosbekännelse, betecknas såsom statskyrka, d. v. s. står under konungens (statens) »uppsikt, vård och försvar», hvarför staten ordnar dess författning och ekonomi. Jfr best:na om konungens och statsrådens religion. Denna religion läres i statens skolor samt är genom grundlag särskildt skyddad, hvarförutom dess präster utgjort ett riksstånd; ett ecklesiastikdepartement skall finnas; konungen tillsätter en del kyrkliga ämbetsmän; statskyrkans helgdagar skola respekteras äfven af främmande trosbekännare, som ock måste bidraga till dess utgifter; konung och riksdag deltaga i kyrkolags stiftande, konungen gifver kyrkostadgar. Det har till och med händt, att k. m:t lämnat bidrag af statsmedel till aflönande af extra predikant med uppgift att motverka vissa dissenters villomeningar. Konungen är ''summus episcopus'' (summ-episkopat), kyrkans hufvud- och styresman (''cujus est regio, illius est religio''): territorialsystem i motsats till hierarkiakt och associationssystem.''"

'''Freethought''' (or "free thought")&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt; is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[point of view (philosophy)|viewpoint]] which holds that positions regarding [[truth]] should be formed on the basis of [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[empiricism]], rather than [[authority]], [[tradition]], [[revelation]], or [[dogma]]. In particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker|title=Freethinker – Definition of freethinker by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/free+thought|title=Free thought – Define Free thought at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117115830/http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cognitive]] application of freethought is known as "freethinking", and practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |title=Nontracts |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to indicate people who inquired into the basis of traditional religious beliefs.

==Definition==
Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry,]] and logic. The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], or [[sectarianism]].

Modern freethinkers consider freethought as a natural freedom of all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freethinkers.com/who-are-the-freethinkers/|title=who are the Freethinkers?|work=Freethinkers.com|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist author Adam Lee defines freethought as thinking which is independent of revelation, tradition, established belief, and [[argument from authority|authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2010/02/what-is-freethought/|title=What Is Freethought?|work=Daylight Atheism|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as a "broader umbrella" than atheism "that embraces a rainbow of unorthodoxy, religious dissent, skepticism, and unconventional thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/daylight-atheism/9-great-freethinkers-and-religious-dissenters-in-history|title=9 Great Freethinkers and Religious Dissenters in History|author=Adam Lee|work=Big Think|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic summarizing statement of the essay ''The Ethics of Belief'' by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher [[William Kingdon Clifford]] is: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."&lt;ref&gt;William Kingdon Clifford, ''The Ethics of Belief'' (1879 [1877]).&lt;/ref&gt; The essay became a rallying cry for freethinkers when published in the 1870s, and has been described as a point when freethinkers grabbed the moral high ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Lawrence and Charlotte |date=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Ethics (article on "agnosticism") |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=44 |isbn=9781135350963 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford was himself an organizer of freethought gatherings, the driving force behind the Congress of Liberal Thinkers held in 1878.

Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers typically hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], "No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, [[creed]], or [[messiah]]. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth." and "Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/faq/feeds/item/18391-what-is-a-freethinker|title=What is a Freethinker?  - Freedom From Religion Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote the following in his 1944 essay "The Value of Free Thought:"
{{Quote |text=What makes a freethinker is not his beliefs but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought he finds a balance of evidence in their favour, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}
The whole first paragraph of the essay makes it clear that a freethinker is not necessarily an atheist or an agnostic, as long as he or she satisfies this definition:
{{Quote |text=The person who is free in any respect is free ''from'' something; what is the free thinker free from? To be worthy of the name, he must be free of two things: the force of tradition, and the tyranny of his own passions. No one is ''completely'' free from either, but in the measure of a man's emancipation he deserves to be called a free thinker. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}

[[Fred Edwords]], former executive of the [[American Humanist Association]], suggests that by Russell's definition, [[liberal religion]]ists who have challenged established orthodoxies can be considered freethinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |title=Saga Of Freethought And Its Pioneers |work=American Humanist Association |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715023327/http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |archivedate=15 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, according to Bertrand Russell, atheists and/or agnostics are not necessarily freethinkers. As an example, he mentions [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], whom he compares to a "[[pope]]":
{{Quote |text=what I am concerned with is the doctrine of the modern Communistic Party, and of the Russian Government to which it owes allegiance. According to this doctrine, the world develops on the lines of a Plan called [[Dialectical Materialism]], first discovered by [[Karl Marx]], embodied in the practice of a great state by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and now expounded from day to day by a Church of which Stalin is the Pope. […] Free discussion is to be prevented wherever the power to do so exists; […] If this doctrine and this organization prevail, free inquiry will become as impossible as it was in the middle ages, and the world will relapse into bigotry and obscurantism. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery}}

In the 18th and 19th century, many thinkers regarded as freethinkers were [[deists]], arguing that [[The nature of God in Western theology|the nature of God]] can only be known from a study of nature rather than from religious revelation. In the 18th century, "deism" was as much of a 'dirty word' as "atheism", and deists were often stigmatized as either atheists or at least as freethinkers by their Christian opponents.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to An Account of the Growth of Deism in England (1696) by William Stephens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04679b.htm |title=Deism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Francis |editor-last=Aveling |year=1908 |quote=The deists were what nowadays would be called freethinkers, a name, indeed, by which they were not infrequently known; and they can only be classed together wholly in the main attitude that they adopted, viz. in agreeing to cast off the trammels of authoritative religious teaching in favour of a free and purely rationalistic speculation.... Deism, in its every manifestation was opposed to the current and traditional teaching of revealed religion. |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deists today regard themselves as freethinkers, but are now arguably less prominent in the freethought movement than atheists.

==Symbol==
[[Image:Pansy aka.jpg|thumb|The [[pansy]], symbol of freethought]]

The [[pansy]] serves as the long-established and enduring symbol of freethought; literature of the [[American Secular Union]] inaugurated its usage in the late 1800s. The reasoning behind the pansy as the symbol of freethought lies both in the flower's name and in its appearance. The pansy derives its name from the [[French language|French]] word ''pensée'', which means "thought".  It allegedly received this name because the flower is perceived by some to bear resemblance to a human face, and in mid-to-late summer it nods forward as if deep in thought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120523184444/http://www.ffrf.org/fttoday/1997/june_july97/gaylor.html A Pansy For Your Thoughts, by Annie Laurie Gaylor, Freethought Today, June/July 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-modern movement===
Critical thought has flourished in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, in the repositories of knowledge and wisdom in [[Ireland]] and in the [[Iran]]ian civilizations (for example in the era of [[Omar Khayyám|Khayyam]] (1048–1131) and his unorthodox [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|''Rubaiyat'']] poems), and in other civilizations, such as the Chinese (note for example the seafaring renaissance of the [[Liu_Song_dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasty of 420–479),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song.html Chinese History – Song Dynasty 宋 (www.chinaknowledge.de)]&lt;/ref&gt; and on through [[Heresy|heretical]] thinkers on esoteric [[alchemy]] or [[astrology]], to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]].

French physician and writer [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] celebrated "rabelaisian" freedom as well as good feasting and drinking (an expression and a symbol of freedom of the mind) in defiance of the hypocrisies of [[conformist]] [[orthodoxy]] in his [[utopian]] [[Thelema#Fran.C3.A7ois Rabelais|Thelema]] Abbey (from θέλημα: free "will"), the device of which was ''Do What Thou Wilt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;So had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because free people ... act virtuously and avoid vice. They call this honor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Rabelais's hero [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] journeys to the "Oracle of The Div(in)e Bottle", he learns the lesson of life in one simple word: ''"Trinch!"'', Drink! Enjoy the simple life, learn wisdom and knowledge, as a free human. Beyond puns, irony, and satire, Gargantua's prologue-[[metaphor]] instructs the reader to "break the bone and suck out the substance-full marrow" ("''la substantifique moëlle''"), the core of wisdom.

===Modern movements===
The year 1600 is considered a landmark in the era of modern freethought. It was the year of the execution in Italy of [[Giordano Bruno]], a former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Monk, by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=gatti18&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Hilary|title=Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science: Broken Lives and Organizational Power|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cYumhwTQP8C|accessdate=21 March 2014|quote=For Bruno was claiming for the philosopher a principle of free thought and inquiry which implied an entirely new concept of authority: that of the individual intellect in its serious and continuing pursuit of an autonomous inquiry… It is impossible to understand the issue involved and to evaluate justly the stand made by Bruno with his life without appreciating the question of free thought and liberty of expression. His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=montano1&gt;{{cite book|last=Montano|first=Aniello|title=Le deposizioni davanti al tribunale dell'Inquisizione|date=24 November 2007|publisher=La Città del Sole|location=Napoli|page=71|editor=Antonio Gargano|quote=In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, become increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birx&gt;{{cite news|last=Birx|first=James|title=Giordano Bruno|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mobile Alabama Harbinger|date=11 November 1997|quote=To me, Bruno is the supreme martyr for both free thought and critical inquiry… Bruno's critical writings, which pointed out the hypocrisy and bigotry within the Church, along with his tempestuous personality and undisciplined behavior, easily made him a victim of the religious and philosophical intolerance of the 16th century. Bruno was excommunicated by the Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches for his heretical beliefs. The Catholic hierarchy found him guilty of infidelity and many errors, as well as serious crimes of heresy… Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
The term ''free-thinker'' emerged towards the end of the 17th century in England to describe those who stood in opposition to the institution of the [[Church of England|Church]], and the literal belief in the [[Bible]]. The beliefs of these individuals were centered on the concept that people could understand the world through consideration of nature. Such positions were formally documented for the first time in 1697 by [[William Molyneux]] in a widely publicized letter to [[John Locke]], and more extensively in 1713, when [[Anthony Collins]] wrote his ''Discourse of Free-thinking,'' which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacks the clergy of all churches and it is a plea for [[deism]].

''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' magazine was first published in Britain in 1881.

====France====
In France, the concept first appeared in publication in 1765 when [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Voltaire]] included an article on ''Liberté de penser'' in their [[Encyclopédie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.8:1431:4.encyclopedie0513.4781541|title=ARTFL Encyclopédie Search Results|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European freethought concepts spread so widely that even places as remote as the [[Jotunheimen]], in [[Norway]], had well-known freethinkers such as [[Jo Gjende]] by the 19th century.&lt;ref name="MEMIM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendesheim|url=http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|website=MEMIM|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808194917/http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|archivedate=8 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François-Jean de la Barre|François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre]] (1745–1766) was a young [[France|French]] nobleman, famous for having been [[torture]]d and [[Decapitated|beheaded]] before his body was burnt on a [[pyre]] along with Voltaire's ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]''.  La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a [[Roman Catholic]] religious procession, but the elements of the case were far more complex.&lt;ref name="Gregory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Mary Efrosini|title=Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433103735|page=192|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=9781433103735|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Christian [[religious intolerance]]; La Barre along with [[Jean Calas]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], was championed by Voltaire. A second replacement statue to de la Barre stands nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris]] at the summit of the butte [[Montmartre]] (itself named from the ''Temple of Mars''), the highest point in [[Paris]] and an [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]] street nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]] is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

====Germany====
In Germany, during the period 1815–1848 and before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]], the resistance of citizens against the dogma of the church increased. In 1844, under the influence of [[Johannes Ronge]] and [[Robert Blum]], belief in the [[Rights of Man|rights of man]], tolerance among men, and [[humanism]] grew, and by 1859 they had established the ''Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands'' (literally ''Union of Free Religious Communities of Germany''), an association of persons who consider themselves to be religious without adhering to any established and institutionalized church or sacerdotal cult. This union still exists today, and is included as a member in the umbrella organization of free humanists. In 1881 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Ludwig Büchner]] established the ''Deutscher Freidenkerbund'' ([[German Freethinkers League]]) as the first German organization for [[Atheism|atheists]] and agnostics. In 1892 the ''Freidenker-Gesellschaft'' and in 1906 the ''Deutscher Monistenbund'' were formed.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

Freethought organizations developed the "[[Jugendweihe]]" (literally ''Youth consecration''), a secular "[[confirmation]]" ceremony, and atheist funeral rites.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-472-06938-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese, Dagmar |title=Growing up female in Nazi Germany |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Mich |year=2006 |page=160 |isbn=0-472-06938-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5qA4My-C2nkC&amp;pg=PA160 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union of Freethinkers for Cremation was founded in 1905, and the Central Union of German Proletariat Freethinker in 1908. The two groups merged in 1927, becoming the German Freethinking Association in 1930.&lt;ref name="Reinhalter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Reinhalter|first=Helmut| editors=Bromiley, Geoffrey William; Fahlbusch, Erwin |chapter= Freethinkers|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity |publisher=Wm.

More "bourgeois" organizations declined after [[World War I]], and "proletarian" Freethought groups proliferated, becoming an organization of socialist parties.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt; European socialist freethought groups formed the International of Proletarian Freethinkers (IPF) in 1925.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt; Activists agitated for Germans to disaffiliate from their respective Church and for seculari-zation of elementary schools; between 1919–21 and 1930–32 more than 2.5 million Germans, for the most part supporters of the Social Democratic and Communist parties, gave up church membership.&lt;ref name="lamberti"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lamberti, Marjorie |title=Politics Of Education: Teachers and School Reform in Weimar Germany (Monographs in German History) |publisher=Berghahn Books |location=Providence |year=2004 |page= 185|isbn=1-57181-299-7 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jbmwM4wsMKEC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict developed between radical forces including the Soviet [[League of the Militant Godless]] and Social Democratic forces in Western Europe led by Theodor Hartwig and [[Max Sievers]].&lt;ref name="peris"&gt;{{cite book |author=Peris, Daniel |title=Storming the heavens: the Soviet League of the Militant Godless |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1998 |isbn=0-8014-3485-8 |pages=110–11 |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC2LSv5QNYkC&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 the Soviet and allied delegations, following a walk-out, took over the IPF and excluded the former leaders.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt;
Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, most freethought organizations were banned, though some right-wing groups that worked with so-called ''[[Völkisch]]e Bünde'' (literally ''"ethnic" associations'' with nationalist, xenophobic and very often racist ideology) were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Jochen-Christoph|title=Atheismus und religiöse Indifferenz|editor=Christel Gärtner|publisher=VS Verlag|year=2003|volume=Organisierter Atheismus|isbn=978-3-8100-3639-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXOr4xQFSJsC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], along with the two Circles of Free Inquiry (Dutch and French speaking), defend the freedom of critical thought, [[Laity|lay]] philosophy and [[ethics]], while rejecting the [[Appeal to authority|argument of authority]].

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, freethought has existed in organized form since the establishment of De Dageraad (now known as [[De Vrije Gedachte]]) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, [[Multatuli]], Adriaan Gerhard and [[Domela Nieuwenhuis]].

In 2009, Frans van Dongen established the Atheist-Secular Party, which takes a considerably restrictive view of religion and public religious expressions.

Since the 19th century, Freethought in the Netherlands has become more well known as a political phenomenon through at least three currents: liberal freethinking, conservative freethinking, and classical freethinking. In other words, parties which identify as freethinking tend to favor non-doctrinal, rational approaches to their preferred ideologies, and arose as secular alternatives to both clerically aligned parties as well as labor-aligned parties. Common themes among freethinking political parties are "freedom", "liberty", and "[[individualism]]".

====United States====
The Free Thought movement first organized itself in the United States as the "Free Press Association" in 1827 in defense of George Houston, publisher of ''The Correspondent'', an early journal of [[Biblical criticism]] in an era when blasphemy convictions were still possible.  Houston had helped found an [[Owenite]] community at Haverstraw, New York in 1826–27.  The short-lived ''Correspondent'' was superseded by the ''Free Enquirer'', the official organ of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] community in Indiana, edited by [[Robert Dale Owen]] and by [[Fanny Wright]] between 1828 and 1832 in New York.  During this time Robert Dale Owen sought to introduce the philosophic skepticism of the Free Thought movement into the [[Working Men's Party (New York)|Workingmen's Party]] in New York City.  The ''Free Enquirer'''s annual civic celebrations of Paine's birthday after 1825 finally coalesced in 1836 in the first national Free Thinkers organization, the "United States Moral and Philosophical Society for the General Diffusion of Useful Knowledge".  It was founded on August 1, 1836, at a national convention at the Lyceum in Saratoga Springs with Isaac S. Smith of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, as president.  Smith was also the 1836 [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]'s candidate for Governor of New York and had also been the Workingmen's Party candidate for Lt. Governor of New York in 1830.  The Moral and Philosophical Society published ''The Beacon'', edited by Gilbert Vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hugins|first= Walter|title= Jacksonian Democracy and the Working Class: A Study of the New York Workingmen's Movement 1829–1837|year= 1960|publisher= Stanford University Press|location= Stanford|pages= 36–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the 19th century saw an [[immigration]] of [[German people|German]] freethinkers and anti-clericalists to the United States (see [[Forty-Eighters]]).  In the United States, they hoped to be able to live by their principles, without interference from government and church authorities.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"&gt;

Many Freethinkers settled in German immigrant strongholds, including [[St. Louis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Texas]], where they founded the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]], Texas, as well as others.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

These groups of German Freethinkers referred to their organizations as ''Freie Gemeinden'', or "free congregations".&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt; The first Freie Gemeinde was established in St. Louis in 1850.&lt;ref name="American Irreligion 1966"&gt;Demerath, N.

Freethinkers tended to be liberal, espousing ideals such as racial, social, and sexual equality, and the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

The "Golden Age of Freethought" in the US came in the late 1800s.  The dominant organization was the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]] which formed in 1876 in Philadelphia. This group re-formed itself in 1885 as the American Secular Union under the leadership of the eminent agnostic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]. Following Ingersoll's death in 1899 the organization declined, in part due to lack of effective [[leadership]].&lt;ref name=ftt&gt;{{cite web|title= National Liberal League|url= http://www.freethought-trail.org/profile.php?By=Person&amp;Page=30|work= The Freethought Trail|publisher= freethought-trail.org|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freethought in the United States declined in the early twentieth century. Its anti-religious views alienated would-be sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The movement also lacked cohesive goals or beliefs. By the early twentieth century, most Freethought congregations had disbanded or joined other mainstream churches. The longest continuously operating Freethought congregation in America is the Free Congregation of Sauk County, Wisconsin, which was founded in 1852 and is still active {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}. It affiliated with the [[American Unitarian Association]] (now the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) in 1955.&lt;ref name="Sauk County Freethinkers"&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the Free Congregation of Sauk County: The "Freethinkers" Story | publisher = Free Congregation of Sauk County | date = April 2009 | url = http://www.freecongregation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=59 | accessdate = 2012-02-05 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120326214734/http://www.freecongregation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=59 | archivedate = 2012-03-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

In 1873 a handful of secularists founded the earliest known secular organization in [[English Canada]], the Toronto Freethought Association. Reorganized in 1877 and again in 1881, when it was renamed the Toronto Secular Society, the group formed the nucleus of the Canadian Secular Union, established in 1884 to bring together freethinkers from across the country.

A significant number of the early members appear to have come from the educated labour "aristocracy", including Alfred F. Jury, J. Ick Evans and J. I. Livingstone, all of whom were leading labour activists and secularists. The second president of the Toronto association, [[T. Phillips Thompson]], became a central figure in the city's labour and social-reform movements during the 1880s and 1890s and arguably Canada's foremost late nineteenth-century labour intellectual. By the early 1880s scattered freethought organizations operated throughout southern [[Ontario]] and parts of [[Quebec]], eliciting both urban and rural support.

The principal organ of the freethought movement in Canada was ''[[Secular Thought]]'' (Toronto, 1887–1911). Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker [[Charles Watts (secularist) |Charles Watts]] (1835–1906), it came under the editorship of Toronto printer and publisher James Spencer Ellis in 1891 when Watts returned to England.

In 1968 the [[Humanist Association of Canada]] (HAC) formed to serve as an umbrella group for humanists, atheists, and freethinkers, and to champion social justice issues and oppose religious influence on public policy—most notably in the fight to make access to abortion free and legal in Canada. HAC, also known as Humanist Canada, operates as an active voice for humanism in Canada{{cn|date=May 2018}} and supports the activities of groups who wish to raise awareness about secular issues.

The [http://www.secularalliance.ca Canadian Secular Alliance] is an active community.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

====Anarchism====
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
In the United States, "freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker.'' E.C. Walker was co-editor of the freethought/free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''."&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf|title=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|work=Mises Institute|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 143]&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith, and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin´s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez.

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and freethinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geoffrey C.

Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |archivedate=2010-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer's ideas, generally, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1936">'''Gerin oil''' or '''geriniol''' is a fictional drug used as a device to criticize [[religion]] in articles written by [[Richard Dawkins]]. The word is an [[anagram]] of "[[religion]]".

The first article, ''Gerin Oil'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anst.uu.se/dla05000/Gerin%20Oil.html Gerin Oil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725123716/http://www.anst.uu.se/dla05000/Gerin%20Oil.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in an American [[secular humanism]] publication, ''[[Free Inquiry]]'', in December 2003 (Volume 24, No. 1).  It was popularised in an article titled ''Opiate of the Masses''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7036 Opiate of the Masses]&lt;/ref&gt;  It describes a dangerous legal drug "Gerin Oil" or "Geriniol." Dawkins blames its effects as being responsible for historic acts of violence such as the [[September 11th attacks]], massacres of native South Americans by [[conquistadors]], and the [[Salem Witch Trials]].

In Dawkins' satirical description, users are often introduced to the "drug" at social gatherings such as weddings and funerals. In small amounts it is considered harmless, but its usage may increase over time. Medium usage of "Gerin Oil" is said to cause a disconnect with reality where users expect private wishes expressed to come true, and may be accompanied by spasmodic muscular movement or contraction. In large doses it is said to cause aural or visual hallucinations. He also links its use to child mutilation, sexual prohibition, and the tendency to smile when convicted of mass murder.

[[Christopher Hitchens]] included Dawkins' essay in his compilation ''[[The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Non-Believer|The Portable Atheist]]''.

[[File:SaidaCastle.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Sidon Sea Castle|Sidon's Sea Castle]], built by the [[Crusaders]] as a fortress of the Holy Land in [[Sidon]], [[Lebanon]]]]

The '''Holy Land''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקּוֹדֶשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}, {{lang-la|Terra Sancta}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|الأرض المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Al-Arḍ Al-Muqaddasah''}} or {{lang|ar|الديار المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Ad-Diyar Al-Muqaddasah''}}) is an area roughly located between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Traditionally, it is synonymous with both the biblical [[Land of Israel]] and historical [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The term usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern [[State of Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], western [[Jordan]], and parts of southern [[Lebanon]] and southwestern [[Syria]]. It is considered [[holy]] by [[Jews]], [[Christian]]s, and [[Muslim]]s.

Part of the significance of the land stems from the [[religious significance of Jerusalem]], the holiest city to [[Judaism]], the historical region of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' ministry]], and the site of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] event in [[Islam]].

The holiness of the land to Christianity was part of the motivation for the [[Crusades]], as European Christians sought to win back the Holy Land from the Muslims, who had [[Muslim conquests|conquered it]] from the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]].

Many sites in the Holy Land have long been [[pilgrimage]] destinations for adherents of the [[Abrahamic religions]], including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and [[Bahá'ís]]. [[Pilgrim]]s visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their [[faith]], confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.metti-bronner.com/Jerusalem.pdf |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=1 July 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews do not commonly refer to the [[Land of Israel]] as "Holy Land" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקוֹדֵשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}). The [[Tanakh]] explicitly refers to it as "holy land" in only one passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Zechariah|2:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "holy land" is further used twice in the deuterocanonical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Wisdom|12:3|NRSV}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:7|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiness of the Land of Israel is generally implied in the Tanakh by the Land being given to the [[Israelites]] by God, that is, it is the "[[promised land]]", an integral part of [[Covenant (biblical)|God's covenant]]. In the [[Torah]] many [[mitzvot]] commanded to the Israelites can only be performed in the Land of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Ziegler, ''Halakhic positions of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik: Volume 4'', KTAV Publishing House, 2007, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; which serves to differentiate it from other lands. For example, in the Land of Israel, "no land shall be sold permanently" (Lev. 25:23). [[Shmita]] is only observed with respect to the land of Israel, and the observance of many [[Jewish holiday|holy]] days is different, as an extra day is observed in the [[Jewish diaspora]].

According to [[Eliezer Schweid]]:
{{quote|The uniqueness of the Land of Israel is...'geo-theological' and not merely climatic. This is the land which faces the entrance of the spiritual world, that sphere of existence that lies beyond the physical world known to us through our senses. This is the key to the land's unique status with regard to prophecy and prayer, and also with regard to the commandments&lt;ref&gt;''The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny'', By Eliezer Schweid, Translated by Deborah Greniman, Published 1985 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|0-8386-3234-3}}, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the perspective of the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], the holiness of Israel had been concentrated since the sixteenth century, especially for burial, in the "[[Four Holy Cities]]": [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]] - as [[Judaism]]'s holiest cities. Jerusalem, as the site of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], is considered especially significant.&lt;ref name=1000BCE&gt;
Since the 10th century BCE. "For Jews the city has been the pre-eminent focus of their spiritual, cultural, and national life throughout three millennia." Yossi Feintuch, ''U.S. Policy on Jerusalem'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-313-25700-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred burials are still undertaken for diaspora Jews who wish to lie buried in the holy soil of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11867-palestine-holiness-of | title=PALESTINE, HOLINESS OF | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Joseph Jacobs, Judah David Eisenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is Mount [[Moriah]], the location of the [[binding of Isaac]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the name "[[Jerusalem]]" 669 times, often because many mitzvot can only be performed within its environs. The name "[[Zion]]", which usually refers to Jerusalem, but sometimes the Land of Israel, appears in the Hebrew Bible 154 times.

The [[Talmud]] mentions the religious duty of colonising Israel.&lt;ref name="Herzog1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaac Herzog|title=The Main Institutions of Jewish Law: The law of obligations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq3XAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 June 2011|year=1967|publisher=Soncino Press|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; So significant in Judaism is the act of purchasing land in Israel, the Talmud allows for the lifting of certain religious restrictions of [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] observance to further its acquisition and settlement.&lt;ref name="Zahavi1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yosef Zahavi|title=Eretz Israel in rabbinic lore (Midreshei Eretz Israel): an anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK7hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 June 2011|year=1962|publisher=Tehilla Institute|page=28|quote=If one buys a house from a non-Jew in Israel, the title deed may be written for him even on the Sabbath.

Eleazar b. Shammua' and R. [[Johanan HaSandlar]] left Israel to study from R. [[Judah ben Bathyra]], they only managed to reach [[Sidon]] when "the thought of the sanctity of Palestine overcame their resolution, and they shed tears, rent their garments, and turned back".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the Jewish population being concentrated in Israel, emigration was generally prevented, which resulted in a limiting of the amount of space available for Jewish learning. However, after suffering persecutions in Israel for centuries after the destruction of the Temple, Rabbis who had found it very difficult to retain their position moved to Babylon, which offered them better protection. Many Jews wanted Israel to be the place where they died, in order to be buried there. The sage Rabbi Anan said "To be buried in Israel is like being buried under the altar."&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(Translator)2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gil1997"/&gt; The saying "His land will absolve His people" implies that burial in Israel will cause one to be absolved of all one's sins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11867-palestine-holiness-of|title=PALESTINE, HOLINESS OF - JewishEncyclopedia.com|last=|first=|date=|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3364937/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Fly-Their-Dead-to-Israel-for-Burial.htm|title=Why Do Jews Fly Their Dead to Israel for Burial?|website=www.chabad.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holy sepulchre mass.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Christianity, as it is the purported site of Christ's resurrection.]]
[[File:Tebnine11.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Crusader castle of [[Toron]] in the village of [[Tebnine|Tibnin]], [[Lebanon]]]]

For [[Christian]]s, the [[Land of Israel]] is considered holy because of its association with the [[Birth of Jesus|birth]], ministry, [[crucifixion]] and [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus]], whom Christians regard as the Savior or [[Messiah]], and because it is the land of the Jewish people (according to the Bible). Christian books, including editions of the Bible, often had maps of the Holy Land (considered to be Galilee, Samaria, Judea). For instance, the ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel book through Holy Scripture) of Heinrich Bünting (1545-1606), a German Protestant pastor, featured such a map.&lt;ref name="wdl"/&gt; His book was very popular, and it provided "the most complete available summary of biblical geography and described the geography of the Holy Land by tracing the travels of major figures from the Old and New testaments."&lt;ref name="wdl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of the Holy Land|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2891/|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1585|language=German|author1=Bünting, Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a geographic term, the description "Holy Land" loosely encompasses modern-day [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Lebanon]], western [[Jordan]] and south-western [[Syria]].

[[File:Jerusalem Al-Aqsa Mosque BW 2010-09-21 06-38-12.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem]]
{{See also|Jerusalem in Islam|Syria (region)}}
In the [[Qur'an]], the term {{lang-ar|'''الأرض المقدسة'''}} ({{transl|ar|''Al-Ard Al-Muqaddasah''}}, {{lang-en|"Holy Land"}}) is used in a passage about [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] ([[Moses]]) proclaiming to the [[Children of Israel]]: "O my people! Enter the holy land which [[Allah]] hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin." ([[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an/Al-Meada|Surah 5:21]]) The Quran also refers to the land as being 'Blessed'.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerusalem]] (referred to as ''Al-Quds'' ({{lang-ar|الـقُـدس}}, "The Holy")) has particular significance in Islam. The Quran refers to [[Muhammad]]'s experiencing the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] as "a Journey by night from ''[[Masjid Al-Haram|Al-Masjidil-Haram]]'' to ''[[Masjid Al-Aqsa|Al-Masjidil-Aqsa]]'', whose precincts We did bless ..." (17:1).&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/&gt; ''[[Ahadith]]'' infer that the "Farthest Masjid" is in Al-Quds; for example, as narrated by [[Abu Huraira]]h: "On the night journey of the Apostle of Allah, two cups, one containing wine and the other containing milk, were presented to him at Al-Quds (Jerusalem). He looked at them and took the cup of milk. Angel Gabriel said, "Praise be to Allah, who guided you to Al-Fitrah (the right path); if you had taken (the cup of) wine, your ''[[Ummah]]'' would have gone astray". However, some modern scholars argue that the 'Farthest Mosque' was a building or prayer-site just outside [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3596681,00.html|title=The myth of al-Aqsa:Holiness of Jerusalem to Islam has always been politically motivated|website=Ynetnews|date=15 Sep 2008|author=[[Mordechai Kedar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/temples.html|title=The Jewish Temples: The Temples of Jerusalem in Islam|author=[[Martin Kramer]]|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present building of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem had not been built in Muhammad's day, and the Quran does not contain any other reference to Jerusalem, apart from the reference to the change of the ''[[Qibla]]h'' from Jerusalem to Mecca. [[Jerusalem]] was Islam's first ''Qiblah'' (direction of prayer) in Muhammad's lifetime, however, this was later changed to the [[Kaaba]] in the [[Hijaz]]i city of [[Mecca]], following a revelation to Muhammad by the Archangel [[Jibril]],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which it is understood by scholars {{who|date=February 2016}} that it was in answer to the rejection by the Jews of Muhammed's Prophetship.

The exact region referred to as being 'blessed' in the Qur'an, in verses like [17:1], [21:71] and [34:18],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"/&gt; has been interpreted differently by various scholars. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] likens it to a wide land-range including [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], especially the cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]; Az-Zujaj describes it as, ''"[[Damascus]], Palestine, and a bit of [[Jordan]]"''; [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] as, ''"the area between [[al-Arish]] and the [[Euphrates]]"''; and [[Ibn Abbas]] as, ''"the land of [[Jericho]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 934&lt;/ref&gt; This overall region is referred to as "[[Ash-Shām]]" ({{lang-ar|الـشَّـام}}).&lt;ref name="Volume 9 1997 page 261"&gt;Article "AL-SHĀM" by [[C.E. Bosworth]], ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Volume 9 (1997), page 261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal S.

From the classical perspective however Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the Syrian and Arabian deserts, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria. with its capital at Antioch, which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise. down the centuries, Syria like Arabia and Mesopotamia was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as Suriyah, to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the Orontes river, in the vicinity of the towns of Homs and Hama. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in Byzantine and Western European usage, and also in the Syriac literature of some of the Eastern Christian churches, from which it occasionally found its way into Christian Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in Muslim Arabic usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Impiety''' is a perceived lack of proper respect for something considered sacred.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impiety&lt;/ref&gt; Impiety is often closely associated with [[sacrilege]], though it is not necessarily a physical action. Impiety cannot be associated with a [[Cult (religion)|cult]], as it implies a larger belief system was disrespected. One of the Pagan objections to [[Christianity]] was that, unlike other [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], early Christians refused to cast a pinch of incense before the images of the gods, an impious act in their eyes. Impiety in ancient civilizations was a civic concern, rather than religious. It was believed that impious actions such as disrespect towards sacred objects or priests could bring down the wrath of the gods. 
==Historical relevance==

The issue of impiety in antiquity is very controversial because of the anecdotal nature of extant sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Filonik|first = Jakub|date = 2013|title = Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal|url = http://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/Dike/article/view/4290|journal = Dike|language = en|volume = 16|pages = 11–96|doi = 10.13130/1128-8221/4290|issn = 1128-8221}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Athenian men, including [[Alcibiades]], were sentenced to death for impiety in 415 BC, most of whom fled Athens before execution ([[Andocides]] was later charged in 400 or 399 BC in reference to these events). Most famously, the philosopher [[Socrates]] was executed for impiety (as well as corrupting Athenian youth) in 399 BC. An Athenian philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] taught that the sun and the stars were fiery stones whose heat we did not feel because of their distance, and was allegedly accused of impiety in Athens. [[Diagoras of Melos]] was reportedly accused of atheism and had to flee Athens after being charged with impiety for revealing the content of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] to the uninitiated. Philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]] might have been accused of impiety as well.

{{Sri Aurobindo}}
'''Integral yoga''', also called '''supramental yoga''', is the yoga-based philosophy and practice of [[Sri Aurobindo]] and ''The Mother'' ([[Mirra Alfassa]]). Integral yoga  finds all life conscious or subconscious a [[yoga]], defines the term yoga as a methodised effort towards self-perfection by the expression of the secret potentialities latent in the being and  highest condition of victory in that effort - a union of the human individual with the universal and transcendent existence which is seen partially as expressions in humans and in the cosmos. As a yoga idea, that Spirit manifests itself in a process of [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]]. The reverse process of [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] is driven toward a complete manifestation of spirit.

According to [[Sri Aurobindo]], the current status of human evolution is an intermediate stage in the evolution of being, which is on its way to the unfolding of the spirit, and the self-revelation of divinity in all things.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=1107}} Yoga is a rapid and concentrated evolution of being, which can take effect in one life-time, while unassisted natural evolution would take many centuries or many births.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1996|p=282|ps=}} Aurobindo suggests a grand program called sapta chatushtaya (seven quadrates) to aid this evolution.

==Concept of Life==
=== The two common perception of Life &amp; Reality===
Sri Aurobindo finds that there are two extreme views of life, The [[Materialism|materialists]] &amp; The [[Asceticism|Ascetics]]  
 
'''The Materialists''' : He finds materialists would only accept the existence of [[matter]] or [[force]] and deny anything else, &amp; would in their argument  find anything which is not knowable (that which would escape once thought and speech) as inert or a passive, silent Atman, an illusion or a hallucination,   this affirmation by the materialists is based on the association of the real with the materially perceptible, and becomes the basis of his assumption on all his arguments. Which Sri Aurobindo finds cannot give an impartial reasoning. Due to the above notion the materialists would refuse any further inquiry, thus never having a satisfied understanding.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|pp=7-11}} He recommends that the only way to reconcile the materialistic mind with the other truth would be to cross over the layers of inner consciousness either by objective analysis of life &amp; mind as to matter or by subjective synthesis and illumination, arrive at a state of the ultimate unity without denying the energy of the expressing multiplicity of the universe.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=9}}
He finds that the current World is in a state of [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] materialism, &amp; finds that this rationalistic movement has served human kind in a positive way, by purifying intellect from the [[dogma]]s, [[superstitions]] clearing path to a better advancement of Humanity.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=10}} Sri Aurobindo finds that root of this Scientific movement to be a search for knowledge, due to this root the movement would not come to a halt and its progress is a sure sign that it would carry forward in reaching the other part of knowledge which [[vedantins]] had found in a different way.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=13}}

'''The Ascetics''' : would only accept [[Ātman (Hinduism)|spirit/Atman]] and terming the remaining as mechanical unintelligent substance or energy, leading to believing the reality to be an illusion of senses.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=7}} Sri Aurobindo finds when the mind retracts from external activities and has experience of silence, a powerful convincing experience that only the pure self or non-being is real leads them to disregard the outer world. 
he finds this as an revolt of spirit on matter which was made famous by [[Buddhism]] affirming that it is impossible  to find a solution in the [[Reality|world]] which is termed to be dual in nature, but to escape into [[Nirvana]], [[Brahmaloka]] or [[Goloka]] as beyond. He finds that this approach is slowly coming to an end and had its importance as the part of evolution, but is quite different than what was present in Vedic period.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|pp=13-28}}

''' Integral yoga's take on Reality''':
Sri Aurobindo finds that a compromise between the two approaches would be a bargain &amp; would not be a true reconciliation, but only a unified Spirit &amp; Matter would be a basis for Integral yoga's  path to understanding of reality.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=25}} He finds the [[Anatta|non being]] at one end which seems opposite to the manifested universe are not opposites which would deny other's existence, but rather are different states of reality with opposite affirmations. Sri Aurobindo finds that the highest experience of the Reality to be a conscious Existence, a supreme Intelligence, Force and a self-existent Bliss; He finds a liberated intelligence &amp; experience would bring about this highest understanding of the reality.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=32}}

=== Humanity and its purpose ===

====Involution====
{{Main|Involution (esoterism)}}

Involution is the extension of Spirit, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], to create a universe of separate forms. Being manifests itself as a multiplicity of forms, meanwhile becoming lost in the inconscience of matter.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' Bk I, Ch.11-12&lt;/ref&gt; The first manifestation of Spirit in the process of involution is as ''[[Satchitananda]]'', and then as Supermind, the intermediate link between the higher (Spirit) and lower (matter, life, and mind) nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aurobindo the world is a differentiated unity. It is a manifold oneness, that generates an infinite variety of lifeforms and substances. The lifeforms and substances are stretched out on a wide range, from physical matter to a pure form of spiritual being, where the subject becomes fully aware of itself as spirit:{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=254-255|ps=}}  
* [[Matter|Material]]- a submerged consciousness concealed in its action and losing itself in the form.
* [[Vitalism|Vital]]- an emerging consciousness, a consciousness half delivered out of its original imprisonment which has become of vital craving and satisfaction or repulsion.     
* [[Mind|Mental]]- an emerged consciousness reflecting fact of life in a mental sense, perceptive and ideative. It modifies the internal and attempts to modify conformably the external existence of the being.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=221|ps=}}

Above Mind proper lie various higher levels of Mind, which ascend toward Spirit.

==== Evolution ====
Through evolution Spirit rediscoveres itself as Spirit. Evolution follows a developmental trajectory from the original inconscience of matter into life, to mind, and then to spiritualized mind, culminating in [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|The Supermind]] or Truth Consciousness.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=254-255|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' bk II, ch.27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is [[Teleology|teleological]],{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}}{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}} since the developing entity contains within itself already the totality toward which it develops.{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}} It is not a mechanistic or deterministic teleology,{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}}{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}} but a "manifestation of all the possibilities inherent in the total movement."{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}}

==== The goal of integral yoga ====
The goal of Integral yoga is to become aware of the Divine, to integrate the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of ourselves, and to manifest the Divine at earth.{{sfn|Vrinte|1996|p=140}} According to Sri Aurobindo, all life is Yoga, while Yoga as a [[sadhana]] is a methodised effort towards self-perfection, which brings to expression the latent, hidden potentialities of being. Success in this effort unifies the human individual with the universal and transcendental Existence.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=6}} Integral yoga reunites "the infinite in the finite, the timeless in the temporal and the transcendent with the immanent.

===Three types of being ===
Sri Aurobindo discerns three types of being, namely the Outer being, the Inner being, and the Psychic Being.

====The Outer Being====
The Outer Being includes the physical, vital and mental levels of Being, which characterises our everyday consciousness and experience. It includes several levels of the subconscient: a mental subconscient, a vital subconscient, and a physical subconscient, down to the material Inconscient.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; Integral Yoga involves going beyond this surface consciousness to the larger life of the Inner Being, which is more open to spiritual realisation.

====The Inner or Subliminal Being====
The Inner Being, or Subliminal,{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}}{{sfn|Vrinte|2002|p=235}} includes the inner realms or aspects of the physical, vital and mental being. They have a larger, subtler, freer consciousness than that of the everyday consciousness. Its realisation is essential for any higher spiritual realisation.

The Inner Being is also transitional between the surface or Outer Being and the Psychic or Inmost Being. By doing yoga practice ([[sadhana]]), the inner consciousness is being opened, and life turns away from the outward to the inward. The inner consciousness becomes more real than the outer consciousness, and becomes a peace, happiness and closeness to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Yoga'', 3rd ed. 1971, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Psychic Being====
The Psychic Being is Sri Aurobindo's term for the Personal [[Spiritual evolution|Evolving]] [[Soul]], the principle of [[The Divine|Divine]] spirit in every individual.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], the term "Psychic" or Psychic Being is derived from the [[Occultism|occult]] [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] teachings of [[Max Theon|Max Théon]].&lt;ref name="The Life Divine' p. 227"&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;227 note&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Aurobindo distinguishes between the Psychic Being as being defined in his Integral Yoga, and the ordinary meaning of "psychic," which refers more to [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena, or to [[paranormal]] phenomena, which are connected with the subtle physical layers.&lt;ref name="The Life Divine' p. 227"&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;227 note&lt;/ref&gt;
}} The Psychic is the "Innermost Being",{{refn|group=note|[[Amal Kiran]]&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hamilton [http://www.auroville.com/vijnana/spiritual/soulpower.htm The Miraculous Power of the Soul - A meeting with Amal Kiran, Pondicherry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611012237/http://www.auroville.com/Vijnana/spiritual/soulpower.htm |date=2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the permanent being in us that stands behind and supports the physical, vital and mental principles. It "uses mind, life and body as its instruments," undergoing their fate yet also transcending them.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;891&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Integral Yoga]] the goal is to move inward and discover the Psychic Being, which then can bring about a transformation of the outer nature. This transformation of the outer being or ego by the Psychic is called Psychicisation; it is one of the three necessary stages in the realisation of the Supramental consciousness. This Psychic transformation is the decisive movement that enables a never-ending progress in life, through the power of connecting to one's inner spirit or Divine Essence. The Psychic begins its evolution completely veiled and hidden, but grows through successive lifetimes, and gradually exerts a greater influence, taking on the role of spiritual Guide.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' pp.&amp;nbsp;891–4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central being====
'''Central Being''' refers to the [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] and eternal [[spirit]], as opposed to the incarnate and [[spiritual evolution|evolving]] [[Soul]], which he calls the [[Psychic Being]]. Sometimes it refers to both of them together as the essential spiritual core of the being.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' vol.I under "Planes and Parts of Being" (pp.&amp;nbsp;265ff in the 3rd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Being "presides over the different births one after the other but is itself unborn" (ibid p.&amp;nbsp;269). This transcendent Central Being or Spirit is also designated as the [[Jiva]] or [[Paramatman#Advaita|Jivatman]], although the meaning of these terms in Sri Aurobindo's philosophy differs greatly from that of much of conventional [[Vedanta]] (especially [[Advaita Vedanta]])

The levels of being ascend from the inconscient to the Supermind.

===Inconscient===

Inconscient Matter is the lowest level of involution.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=132}}{{sfn|The Mother|1961|p=199}} Spirit is still present in the inconscient:{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=211}} "The Inconscient is the Superconscient's sleep."&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; The Inconscient is also the instrument of the Superconsciousness which has created the Universe.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=297}} According to Satprem, the Inconscient lies at the bottom of the physical subconscient,&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; and "life emerged [...] at the border between the material inconscient and the physical consciousness [...] in our body.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt;

===Subconscient and subtle or subliminal conscient===

The physical, vital and mental levels of being contain both a subconscient and a subtle or subliminal part.{{sfn|Sharma|1992|p=61-63}}

====The subconscient====

The subconscient parts are the submerged parts. It contains "obstinate [[Samskara (Indian philosophy)|samskaras]], impressions, associations, fixed notions, habitual reactions formed by the past."{{sfn|Sharma|1992|p=61}} According to Satprem, there are several levels of the subconscient, corresponding with the different levels of our being: a mental subconscient, a vital subconscient, and a physical subconscient, down to the material Inconscient.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem"&gt;[http://www.aurobindo.ru/workings/satprem/adventure_of_consciousness_e.htm Satprem, ''Aurobindo, or the adventure of consciousness.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aurobindo, the body is partly a creation of the inconscient or subconscient.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=297}} According to The Mother, the ordinary, false consciousness, which is common to material body-consciousness, is derived from the subconscient and the inconscient.{{sfn|The Mother|1961|p=50}} According to Aurobindo, the outer being depends on the subconscient, which hinders the spiritual progress.{{sfn|Sri Aurobindo|1988}} Only by living in the inner being can this obstacle be overcome.{{sfn|Sri Aurobindo|1988}}

According to Sharma, the subconscient is "the inconscient in the proces of becoming conscient."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}} It is a submerged part of the personality without waking consciousness, but which does receive impressions, and influences the conscious mind.{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=61}} According to Sharma, it includes the [[unconscious mind]] which is described by psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung,{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=61}} though it includes much more than the unconscious of ([[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]]) psychology.{{refn|group=note|According to Pani, the inconscient is the same as the western psycho-analytic unconscious mind, while the subconsciousness is another layer of consciousness.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=207}}}}

====The subtle or subliminal conscient====

The subtle or subliminal is the subtle, higher counterpart of the subconscient. According to Sharma, "it has an inner mind, an inner vital being, and an inner subtle physical being, wider than man's consciousness."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}} It can directly experience the Universal, and "it is the source of inspirations, intuitions, ideas, will [...] as well as [...] telepathy [and] clearvoyance."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}}

====Gross body ====
The gross body commonly referred to in yoga constitutes mainly of two parts the material physical body (anna[[kosha]]) and the nervous system normally refer to as vital vehicle (Prana kosha) in Integral yoga.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=10-11}}

=====Physical=====
The Physical level refers to both the [[physical body]] and the body's [[consciousness]]. The body is just as conscious as the vital and mental parts of the being, only it is a different type of consciousness. The Physical not only shades upwards to higher ontological levels, but also downwards into the Subconscient.{{refn|group=note|The Physical can be subdivided into finer sub-grades:
* the ''Physical Proper'' or pure body consciousness, which represents the consciousness of the external physical body itself.
* the ''Vital Physical'' or ''Nervous Being'' (which seems to be equivalent to the [[Etheric body]] of western [[esotericism]], and hence pertains to one of the [[Subtle body|subtle bodies]])
* the ''Mental Physical'' (similar to the Physical Mind - see "[[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]")
* the ''True physical being'' - is the [[Purusha]] of the physical level, which is like the Inner Physical larger than the surface body consciousness and in touch with the a larger spiritual consciousness.
* the ''Inner physical'' - the physical component of the [[inner being]], which is wider and more plastic than the outer physical body.  This is also called the [[subtle physical]]}}

The Subtle physical is [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s term for a subtler aspect of the physical nature. This has many qualities not found in the gross physical nature.  In ''[[Mother's Agenda|The Agenda]]'', [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] often refers to it. It might be compared to the [[etheric body]] and [[etheric plane|plane]], or even the [[astral body]] and [[astral plane|plane]]. The term "subtle physical" is used to distinguish it from gross (''sthula'') or outer material physical.{{refn|group=note|Aurobindo: "By the gross physical is meant the earthly and bodily physical - as experienced by the outward sense-mind and senses. But that is not the whole of Matter.  There is a subtle physical also with a subtler consciousness in it which can, for instance, go to a distance from the body and yet feel and be aware of things in a not merely mental or vital way.&lt;br&gt;...the subtle physical has a freedom, plasticity, intensity, power, colour, wide and manifold play (there are thousands of things there that are not here) of which, as yet, we have no possibility on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, Letters on Yoga part 1, section v&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Vital=====
The Vital level of the being refers to the [[Vitalism|life force]], but also to the various passions, desires, feelings, emotions, affects, compulsions, and likes and dislikes. These strongly determine human motivation and action through desire and enthusiasm.

Unlike Western [[psychology]], in which mind, emotions, instincts, and consciousness are all lumped together, Sri Aurobindo strongly distinguishes between the "Vital" and the "Mental" faculties.

In addition to the individual Vital faculty, Sri Aurobindo refers to a Vital Plane or Vital world, which would seem to be partly equivalent to the [[Astral Plane]] of popular [[occultism]] and [[New Age]] thought.

====Mind or Mental being====

Mind proper is the conceptual and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[mind]]. Mind is a subordinate process of the Supermind.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=42}} It is the intermediary stage between the Divine and the mundane life.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=40-41}} It works by measuring and dividing reality, and has lost sight of the Divine.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=41}} It is the seat of ignorance, yet it is still capable of an upward ascent toward the Divine.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}}

Unlike Western psychology, in which mind and consciousness are considered the same, Sri Aurobindo strongly distinguishes between the "Mental" and the "Vital" (emotional) faculties, as well as between Mind and pure Consciousness. Sri Aurobindo in part bases his concept of the Mental on his reading of the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], the mental being (or perhaps just the Mental Purusha) is the ''mano-maya-atma'' - the self made of mind (''manas'').

For Sri Aurobindo, Mind or the Mental being is not simple and uniform, but consists itself of various strata and subdivisions, which act at different levels of being. These various faculties are described or variously referred to, usually in obliquely or in passing, in some of his books, including ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'', which has poetic references to many types of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984 pp.&amp;nbsp;152–62&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters answering questions from disciples, Sri Aurobindo summarises the characteristics of the various levels of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;Aurobindo, ''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' vol. I pp.&amp;nbsp;324–5&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|A small but popular book by Jyoti and Prem Sobel, ''The Hierarchy of Minds'', comes closest to a systematic coverage of an Aurobindonian noetology by gathering all of Sri Aurobindo's references and quotes on the subject of "Mind" and arranging these according to the type of Mind. These various Minds and Mental principles of being include:&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti and Prem Sobel, ''The Hierarchy of Minds''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''''Physical Mind'''''
* ''The Mechanical Mind'' is a much lower action of the mental physical which when left to itself can only repeat the same ideas and record the reflexes of the physical consciousness in its contact with outward life and things.
* ''Mind in the physical or mental physical'' mentalises the experiences of outward life and things, sometimes very cleverly, but it does not go beyond that, unlike the externalising mind which deals with these things from the perspective of reason and its own higher intelligence.
* ''Physical Mind'' - refers to either or both the Externalising Mind and the Mental in the Physical; it is limited to a physical or [[Materialism|materialistic]] perspective, and cannot go beyond that, unless enlightened from above.
* ''Mind of Light'' - according to [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] this is the Physical Mind receiving the [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|supramental light]] and thus being able to act directly in the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mother, 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;63–64&lt;/ref&gt;
'''''Vital Mind'''''
* ''Vital Mind'' - a mediator between the vital emotions, desires, and so on the mental proper. It is limited by the vital view and feeling of things, and expresses the desires, feelings, ambitions,and other active tendencies of the vital in mental forms, such as daydreams and imaginations of greatness, happiness, and so on. As with the Externalising Mind, Sri Aurobindo associates it with the Vishuddha or Throat Chakra
'''''Mind proper'''''
* ''Mind Proper'' - is free-fold, consisting of Thinking Mind, dynamic Mind, externalising Mind.  It constitutes the sum of one's thoughts, opinions, ideas, and values, which guide conscious thinking, conceptualizing and decision-making processes, and is transformed, widened, and spiritualised through the practice of [[Integral Yoga]].
:* ''Thinking Mind'' - the highest aspect of the mind proper, concerned with ideas and knowledge in their own right.  It is equated with the [[Ajna|Ajna Chakra]]
:* ''Dynamic Mind'' - that aspect of the ordinary mind that puts out of mental forces for realisation, acting by the idea and by reason.  It is also equated with the Ajna or Brow center.
:* ''Externalising Mind'' - the most "external" part of the mind proper, concerned with the expression of ideas in speech, in life, or in any  form it can give.  It is equated with the [[Vishuddha|Vishuddha or Throat Chakra]]
'''''Higher Mind'''''
* ''Higher Mind'' - the first and lowest of the spiritual mental grades, lying above the normal mental level.
* ''Spiritual Mind'' - either the spiritualised mind, or a general term for levels of mind above the normal mental level (the "Mind Proper").
* ''Inner mind'' - the mental component of the Inner Being, which lies behind the surface mind or ordinary consciousness and can only be directly experienced by [[sadhana]]
* ''True mental being'' - is the [[Purusha]] of the mental level freed from the error and ignorance of the lower [[Prakriti]] and open to the knowledge and guidance above.
* ''Psychic Mind'' - a movement of the mind in which the [[Psychic Being]] predominates; the mind turned towards the Divine}}

Above mind proper lie various higher individual levels of mind, namely the Higher Mind, Illumined Mind, Intuitive Mind and Overmind, which ascend toward the Spirit, and provide a higher and more inclusive vision of reality:
* '''Higher Mind''' is the realm of Truth-thought. It can hold a wide range of knowledge in one vision and an integral whole.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}}{{refn|group=note|Compare Ken Wilber's Centaur or vision-logic; see [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)#Levels or stages]]}} It receives [[Illuminationism|illumination]] from the Illumined Mind,{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=45}} and is not dependent on the limited knowledge of the senses.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}} It is also capable of transforming the lower realms of body and mind, effectuating change sof habit and life.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}} Nevertheless, it is still a state of thought, in contrast to Illumined Mind, which is a state of vision and spiritual insight.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=45}}
* '''Illumined''' Mind is the mind of sight and vision. It transformes the Higher Mind by providing it a direct vision.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}}
* '''Intuition''' provides the illumination of thought and vision to the Higher Mind and the Illumined Mind.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}} Mundane mind may experience intuition too, but in the higher realms of mind it becomes more frequent an dstable.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}}
* '''Overmind''' is the [[Cosmic Consciousness]].{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=49}} It is the plane of [[deity|Gods]]. Overmental plane is the highest consciousness one can achieve without transcending the mental system. Beyond overmind are the planes of [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]] or unity-consciousness.{{refn|group=note|A detailed description of the Overmind is provided in Book I ch.28, and Book II ch.26, of Sri Aurobindo's philosophical opus ''[[The Life Divine]]''.}}

====Supermind====
{{main|Supermind (Integral yoga)}}
Supermind is the infinite unitary Truth Consciousness or Truth-Idea beyond the three lower [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]] of [[Matter]], [[Life]], and [[Mind]]. Supermind is the dynamic form of [[Satchitananda|Sachchidananda]] (Being-Consciousness-Bliss), and the necessary mediator or link between the transcendent Sacchidananda and the creation.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''Life Divine'' Book I, ch.14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of the present being==
Humans are stuck between matter and Spirit,{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=210|ps=}} due to the habits of personality and partial awareness, which arise from Ignorance.

=== Personality  ===

Humans are accustomed to respond to certain vibrations more than other. These customs develop into one's desire, pain, feelings, which are all a set of habits. This crystallised set of habits becomes one's personality. This is normally believed to be "self". The appearance of stable personality is given by constant repetition and recurrence of the same vibrations and formations.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=210|ps=}}

===Three basic difficulties for mankind===

According to Aurobindo, humans face three basic problems:
# '''Partial [[Self-awareness]]''': humans are only aware of a small part about themselves. They are aware of the surface of mentality, physical being, and life, and not of the larger and more potent [[subconscious mind]] and hidden life impulses. 
# '''Partial [[awareness]] of other [[beings]]''': humans create a rough mental construction of their fellow beings. Their understanding is created by a mental knowledge, which is imperfect, and subjected to denial and frustration. This partial awareness can be overcome by a conscious unity. This unity can only be achieved from Supermind.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=227|ps=}}
# '''A division between Force and consciousness in evolution''': matter, life and mind are often warring with each other. Materialists try to resolve this war by submitting oneself to the mortality of our being, while ascetics have tried to reject earthly life. A true solution may lie in finding the principle beyond mind, thereby overcoming the mortality of our existence.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=228|ps=}}

===Ignorance===

The fundamental cause of falsehood, error and evil is Ignorance. Ignorance is a self-limiting knowledge, which arises with exclusive concentration in a single field. According to Aurobindo, human notion of good, bad &amp; evil are uncertain and relative.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=622|ps=}}

===Practices===
Unlike other [[Yoga]] practices ''Integral yoga'' does not propose any kind of physical asanas, breathing techniques or external movements. It is more [[psychological]] in nature, with internal reflection and self-analysis &amp; correction as main tools of development .

The main practices or approaches are divided into {{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|pp=2-30}} 
*  The yoga of divine work (yoga through ones work )
*  The yoga of Integral Knowledge ( Yoga through analysis, observation &amp; knowledge) 
*  The Yoga of Divine love ( Commonly referred to as [[Bhakti yoga]] or [[Love of God|love of god]])  
*  The Yoga of Self-Perfection (referred to as a Synthetic yoga or the triple way ) {{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=611}}

==Yogic Practise==
===The Yoga of Self-Perfection===
====The Triple Transformation====
The limitations of the present being can be overcome by the Triple transformation, the process in which the lower nature is transformed into the divine nature. It consists of the inward psychicisation by which the [[sadhaka|sadhak]] gets in contact with the inner divine principle or Psychic Being; the spiritual transformation or spiritualisation; and the Supramentalisation of the entire being.{{refn|group=note|This is described in ''[[The Life Divine]]'' part 2, ch.25, and ''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' part 4, section 1.}}

=====Psychicisation=====
Psychicisation is a turn [[Inner being|inward]], so that one realises the [[psychic being]], the psychic personality or Divine [[Soul]], in the core of one's being. The Divine Soul serves as a spiritual Guide in the yoga, and enables one to transform the [[outer being]].&lt;ref&gt;Aurobindo (1977), ''[[The Life Divine]]'' book II - chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; It may also help avoid the dangers of the spiritual path. There is an [[intermediate zone]], a dangerous and misleading transitional [[spirituality|spiritual]] and pseudospiritual region between the ordinary consciousness and true spiritual realisation.&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"&gt;[http://intyoga.online.fr/intzone.htm Sri Aurobindo's Letters on Yoga - The Intermediate Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychisiation consists of three methods. In "consecration" one opens oneself to the Force before engaging in an activity. "Moving to the Depths" (or "concentration") is a movement away from the surface existence to a deeper existence within. "Surrender" means offering all one's work, one's life to the Divine Force and Intent.&lt;ref&gt;''Synthesis of Yoga'' Part I ch. II-III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters on Yoga'' vol. II pp.585ff (3rd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Guided by the evolving divine soul within, the sadhak moves away from ego, ignorance, finiteness, and the limitations of the [[outer being]]. It is thanks to this guidance by the Divine Soul that the [[sadhaka|sadhak]] can avoid the pitfalls of the spiritual path.

=====Spiritualisation=====
As a result of the Psychicisation, light, peace, and power descend into the body, transforming all of its parts, physical, vital, and mental. This is the Spiritual transformation, or Spiritualisation, the concretisation of the larger spiritual consciousness. It is equivalent to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|"enlightenment"]], as found in [[Vedanta]] and [[Buddhism]].

=====Intermediate zone=====
{{Main|Intermediate zone|Spiritual bypass}}

Aurobindo asserted that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, and freedom from normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intyoga.online.fr/intzone.htm Sri Aurobindo's Letters on Yoga - The Intermediate Zone]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm Grey Lodge Occult Review :: Issue #9 :: The Intermediate Zone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141007/http://greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Supramentalisation=====
Supramentalisation is the realisation of the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]], or Supramental consciousness, and the resulting transformation of the entire being. Psychicisation and spirtualisation serve as necessary prerequisites for the Supramentalisation of the entire being.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', pp.281-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The supramental transformation is the final stage in the integral yoga, enabling the birth of a new individual, fully formed by the supramental power. Such individuals would be the forerunners of a new supra-humanity, grounded in truth-consciousness. All aspects of division and ignorance of consciousness, at the vital and mental levels, would be overcome, and replaced with a unity of consciousness at every plane. And even the physical body transformed and divinised. A new supramental species would then emerge, living a supramental, [[gnostic being|gnostic, divine life]] on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' book II ch.27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurobindo describes several results and different stages depicting the stages of development in integral yoga, called together the ''sapta chatushtaya'', "seven quadrates."&lt;ref group=web name="SC"&gt;[https://auromere.wordpress.com/sapta-chatushthaya/ Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, ''Sapta Chatushtaya'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.uprs.edu/upr-blog/featuresspotlight/press-releases/academic-dean-at-the-university-of-philosophical-research-publishes-new-book/ Dr. Debashish Banerji, ''Seven Quartets of Becoming: A Transformative Yoga Psychology Based on the Diaries of Sri Aurobindo''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004113644/http://www.uprs.edu/upr-blog/featuresspotlight/press-releases/academic-dean-at-the-university-of-philosophical-research-publishes-new-book/ |date=2015-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Aurobindo received these instructions as a series of mantras while he was imprisoned in Alipore prison.

* [[vijnana]] (knowledge), which consists of [[jnanam]] (knowledge), trikaladrsti (knowledge of past, present and future), [[ashtasiddhi]] (eight powers), and [[samadhi]] (absorption);
* Sharira (body), which consists of arogyam (health), [[Transcendental Meditation|utthapana]] (levitation, being free from gravity and physical powers), saundaryam (beauty), [[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|vividhananda]] (bliss);
* Karma (divine work), which consists of [[Krishna]] (avatar of Vishnu), [[Kali]] (the Goddess), [[kama]] (divine delight), and [[Karma yoga|Karma]] (divine action);
* Brahma, the realization of [[Brahman]]; 
* Siddhi (realization), which consists of [[shuddhi]] (purification), [[Moksha|mukti]] (liberation), bhukti (enjoyment), and [[siddhi]] (realisation of yogic powers).

==Influence==
Aurobindo had a strong influence on [[Ken Wilber]]'s [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theory]] of [[Spiritual evolution|spiritual development]].{{sfn|Vrinte|2002}} Wilber's Causal and Ultimate stages closely resemble Aurobindo's higher mental stages, but Wilber lumps together levels of Being, types of Being and developmental stages.

'''John Harwood Hick''' (20 January 1922 – 9 February 2012) was a [[Philosophy of religion|philosopher of religion]] and [[Theology|theologian]] born in England who taught in the United States for the larger part of his career. In [[philosophical theology]], he made contributions in the areas of [[theodicy]], [[eschatology]], and [[Christology]], and in the philosophy of religion he contributed to the areas of [[epistemology]] of religion and [[religious pluralism]].&lt;ref name=peters&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Peters |first=Richard |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Hick: Man of Many Mysticisms }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
John Hick was born on 20 January 1922 to a middle-class family in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], England. In his teens, he developed an interest in philosophy and religion, being encouraged by his uncle, who was an author and teacher at the [[University of Manchester]]. Hick initially pursued a [[law degree]] at the [[University of Hull]], but, having converted to [[Evangelical Christianity]], he decided to change his career and he enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1941.

During his studies, he became liable for [[military service]] in [[World War II]], but, as a [[conscientious objector]] on moral grounds, he enrolled in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]].

After the war, he returned to Edinburgh and became attracted to the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], and began to question his fundamentalism. In 1948 he completed his MA thesis, which formed the basis of his book ''Faith and Knowledge''.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; He went on to complete a [[D. Phil]] at [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], [[Oxford University]] in 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/hick-john.aspx|title=John Hick Centre for Philosophy of Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[DLitt]] from Edinburgh in 1975.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]''.

After many years as a member of the [[United Reformed Church]], in October 2009 he was accepted into membership of the [[Quakers|Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)]] in Britain. He died in 2012.&lt;ref name="University of Birmingham"&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/hick-john.aspx]: ''University of Birmingham'' website.

==Career==
Hick's academic positions included Danforth Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at the [[Claremont Graduate University]], California (where he taught from 1979 to 1992); H.G. Wood Professor of Theology at the [[University of Birmingham]]; and Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Research in Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theology.bham.ac.uk/emeritistaff/hick.htm |title=University of Birmingham |accessdate=25 February 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While at the University of Birmingham Hick played important roles in a number of organizations centered on community relations.  Non-Christian communities, mostly Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, had begun to form in this central England community as immigration from the Caribbean Islands and Indian subcontinent increased. Due to the influx of peoples with different religious traditions, organizations focused on integrating the community became necessary. During his fifteen years at the University of Birmingham, Hick became a founder, as well as the first chair, for the group All Faiths for One Race (AFFOR); he served as a chair on the Religious and Cultural Panel, which was a division of the Birmingham Community Relations Committee; and he also chaired the coordinating committee for a 1944 conference convened under the new Education Act with the aim of creating a new syllabus for religious instruction in city schools.&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also held teaching positions at [[Cornell University]], [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 Gifford Lecture Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032902/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 |date=16 February 2008 }} – Biography – John Hick&lt;/ref&gt; During his teaching stay at Princeton Seminary, Hick began to depart from his conservative religious standings as he began to question "whether belief in the Incarnation required one to believe in the literal historicity of the Virgin Birth".&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.  "A Pluralist View."  "More Than One Way? Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World".  Eds. Dennis L. Okholm and Timothy R. Phillips.  Grand Rapids, MI:  Zondervan Publishing House, 1995. 27–59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This questioning would open the door for further examination of his own Christology, which would contribute to Hick's understanding of religious pluralism. He was the Vice-President of [[the British Society for the Philosophy of Religion]], and Vice-President of The World Congress of Faiths.&lt;ref name="giffordlectures"&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 Full name, year of birth and other biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032902/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 |date=16 February 2008 }}: ''Gifford Lecture Series'' website. Retrieved on 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick delivered the 1986–87 [[Gifford lectures]]&lt;ref name="giffordlectures" /&gt; and in 1991 was awarded the prestigious [[Grawemeyer Award]] from the [[University of Louisville]] and the [[Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary]] for Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Authors/Author.htm?ContributorID=HickJ&amp;QueryStringSite |title=Zondervan |accessdate=25 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick was twice the subject of [[heresy]] proceedings. In 1961 or 1962, he was asked whether he took exception to anything in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith|Westminster Confession of 1647]] and answered that several points were open to question. Because of this, some of the local ministers appealed against his reception into the presbytery. Their appeal was sustained by the Synod. A year later, a counter-appeal was sustained by the Judicial Committee of the General Assembly, and Hick became a member of the presbytery.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Hick's philosophy==
Robert Smid states that Hick is regularly cited as "one of the most – if not simply the most – significant philosopher of religion in the twentieth century".&lt;ref name=smid/&gt; [[Keith Ward]] once described him as "the greatest living philosopher of global religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnhick.org.uk/ Keith Ward], Regius Professor of Divinity, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his advocacy of [[religious pluralism]],&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; which is radically different from the traditional Christian teachings that he held when he was younger.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; Perhaps because of his heavy involvement with the inter-faith groups and his interaction with people of non-Christian faiths through those groups, Hick began to move toward a pluralistic outlook. He notes in both ''More Than One Way?'' and ''God and the Universe of Faiths'' that, as he came to know these people who belonged to non-Christian faiths, he saw in them the same values and moral actions that he recognized in fellow Christians.  This observation led him to begin questioning how a completely loving God could possibly sentence non-Christians who clearly espouse values that are revered in Christianity to an eternity in hell.  Hick then began to attempt to uncover the means by which all those devoted to a theistic religion might receive salvation.

Hick has notably been criticized by then-Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], later Pope between 2005 and 2013, when he was head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. Ratzinger had examined the works of several theologians accused of [[relativism]], such as [[Jacques Dupuis (priest)|Jacques Dupuis]] and [[Roger Haight]], and found that many, if not all, were philosophically inspired by Hick. Therefore, the declaration ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' was seen by many at the time as a condemnation of Hick's ideas and theories.

===Kantian influences===
Having begun his career as an evangelical, he moved towards pluralism as a way of reconciling God’s love with the facts of cultural and religious diversity. He was primarily influenced by Immanuel Kant in this regard, who argued that human minds obscure actual reality in favor of comprehension (see [[Immanuel Kant#Theory of perception|Kant's theory of perception]]). According to Richard Peters, for Hick, "[the] construal of the relationship of the human mind to God...is much like the relationship that Kant supposed exists between the human mind and the world".&lt;ref name=peters/&gt;

It isn't fair to say that Hick is strictly Kantian, however. Peters notes "the divide between the '[[noumenal]]' and '[[phenomenal]]' realms (so far as nature is concerned) is not nearly so severe for Hick as it was for Kant".&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; Hick also declares that the [[God|Divine Being]] is what he calls 'transcategorial'. We can experience God through categories, but God Himself obscures them by his very nature.

===Pluralism===
In light of his Kantian influences, Hick claims that knowledge of the Real (his generic term for Transcendent Reality) can only be known as it is being perceived. For that reason, absolute truth claims about God (to use Christian language) are really truth claims about perceptions of God; that is, claims about the phenomenal God and not the noumenal God. Furthermore, because all knowledge is rooted in experience, which is then perceived and interpreted into human categories of conception, cultural and historical contexts which inevitably influence human perception are necessarily components of knowledge of the Real. This means that knowledge of God and religious truth claims pertaining thereof are culturally and historically influenced; and for that reason should not be considered absolute. This is a significant aspect of Hick's argument against Christian [[exclusivism]], which holds that although other religions might contain partial goodness and truth, [[salvation]] is provided only in Jesus Christ, and the complete truth of God is contained only in Christianity.

Perhaps the simplest manner in which to understand Hick's theory of pluralism of religions is to share the comparison he makes between his own understanding of religion and the Copernican view of our solar system.  Before [[Copernicus]] disseminated his views of the solar-centered universe, the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic system]] ruled in which the stars were painted in the sky, and the sun rose and set around the earth.  In short, the rest of the universe existed for and was centered on earth.  On the other hand, Copernicus asserted that the earth, and other planets as well, circled the sun, which in fact, did not move, but only appeared to move due to the revolution of our planet.  Copernicus introduced our world to the understanding that other planets took similar paths around the sun; while each path differed, all served the same purpose and generated the same result:  every planet makes a full path around our central star. Rotation of a planet about its axis creates day and night for that planet, just as day and night occur on earth.  Although the time frames for a full trip around the sun and for a full day-night cycle differs on a planet-by-planet basis, the concept remains constant throughout our solar system.

Similarly, Hick draws the metaphor that the Ptolemaic view of religion would be that Christianity is the only way to true salvation and knowledge of the one true God. Ptolemaic Christianity would assert that everything exists and all of history has played out in specific patterns for the glory of the Christian God, and that there is no other possible path that will lead to salvation.  Hick appears as Copernicus, offering the belief that perhaps all theistic religions are focused toward the one true God and simply take different paths to achieve the same goal.&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.  ''God and the Universe of Faiths''.  Oxford:  OneWorld Publications Ltd., 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

A speaker on religious pluralism, Keith E. Johnson, compares Hick's pluralistic theology to a [[Blind men and an elephant|tale of three blind men attempting to describe an elephant]], one touching the leg, the second touching the trunk, the third feeling the elephant's side.  Each man describes the elephant differently, and, although each is accurate, each is also convinced of their own correctness and the mistakenness of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Keith E. [http://wri.leaderu.com/theology/hick.html "John Hick's Pluralistic Hypothesis and the Problem of Conflicting Truth-Claims"]. Retrieved 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Smid states that Hick believes that the tenets of Christianity are "no longer feasible in the present age, and must be effectively 'lowered'".&lt;ref name=smid&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smid |first=Robert |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Harwood Hick |url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/mwt/dictionary/mwt_themes_875_hick.htm#John%20Harwood%20Hick |accessdate= February 2008  |edition= |date= |year=1998–1999 |month= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Mark Mann notes that Hick argues that there have been people throughout history "who have been exemplars of the Real".&lt;ref name=mann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Mann |first=Mark |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Hick: Mann's Quick Notes |url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/mwt/dictionary/mwt_themes_875_hick.htm#John%20Hick:%20Mann's%20Quick%20Notes |accessdate= February 2008  |year=1996–1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Here the author uses "Real" in the sense of how Hick defined it: "the referent of the world['s] religion." See Smid, reference 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick's position is "not an exclusively Christian inclusivism [like that of Karl Rahner and his ‘Anonymous Christian’], but a plurality of mutually inclusive inclusivism." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''A Christian Theology of Religion'' (KY: Westminster John Knox press, 1995), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick contends that the diverse religious expressions (religions) are the result of diverse historically and culturally influenced responses to diverse perceptions of the Real. He states that "the different religious traditions, with their complex internal differentiations, have developed to meet the needs of the range of mentalities expressed in the different human cultures." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''God Has Many Names'' (PA: Westminster Press, 1980), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many rebuttals to Hick's pluralism &lt;ref&gt;Keith Ward, "Truth and the Diversity of Religions." Philip L. Quinn and Kevin Meeker, eds. The Philosophical Challenge of Religious Pluralism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hick's Christology===
In his ''God and the Universe of Faiths'' (1973), Hick attempts to pinpoint the essence of Christianity.  He first cites the [[Sermon on the Mount]] as being the basic Christian teaching, as it provides a practical way of living out the Christian faith.  He says that "Christian essence is not to be found in beliefs about God...but in living as the disciples who in his name feed the hungry, heal the sick and create justice in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. ''God and the Universe of Faiths''. Oxford:  Oneworld Publications Ltd., 1973, pp.109–110&lt;/ref&gt; However, all of the teachings, including the Sermon on the Mount, that form what Hick calls the essence of Christianity, flow directly from Jesus' ministry.  In turn, this means that the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus form the permanent basis of the Christian tradition.  Hick continues in this work to examine the manner in which the deification of Jesus took place in corporate Christianity following his crucifixion and questions whether or not Jesus actually thought of himself as the [[Messiah]] and the literal Son of God.

In several places (e.g. his contributions to ''The Metaphor of God Incarnate'', and his book ''[[The Myth of God Incarnate]]'') Hick proposes a reinterpretation of traditional Christology—particularly the doctrine of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. Hick contends "that the historical Jesus of Nazareth did not teach or apparently believe that he was God, or God the Son, Second Person of a Holy Trinity, incarnate, or the son of God in a unique sense."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnhick.org.uk/article16.html Believable Christianity]: A lecture in the annual October series on Radical Christian Faith at Carrs Lane United Reformed Church, Birmingham, 5 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It is for that reason, and perhaps for the sake of religious pluralism and peace, Hick proposes a metaphorical approach to incarnation. That is, Jesus (for example) was not literally God in the flesh (incarnate), but was metaphorically speaking, the presence of God. "Jesus was so open to divine inspiration, so responsive to the divine spirit, so obedient to God's will, that God was able to act on earth in and through him. This, I (Hick) believe, is the true Christian doctrine of the incarnation." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "A Pluralist View" in ''Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World'' eds. Dennis Ockholm and Timothy Phillips (MI: Zondervan, 1995), p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick believes that a metaphorical view of the incarnation avoids the need for faulty Christian paradoxes such as the duality of Christ (fully God and fully human) and even the [[Trinity]] (God is simultaneously one and three).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither the intense christological debates of the centuries leading up to the Council of Chalcedon, nor the renewed christological debates of the 19th and 20th Centuries, have succeeded in squaring the circle by making intelligible the claim that one who was genuinely and unambiguously a man was also genuinely and unambiguously God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/gre3.htm "The Myth of God Incarnate"] from N. F. Gier, ''God, Reason, and the Evangelicals'' (University Press of America, 1987), chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Problem of evil==
Hick has identified with a branch of theodicy that he calls "[[Irenaean theodicy]]" or the "Soul-Making Defense".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen T. Davis, ed. ''Encountering Evil: Live Options in Theodicy'' (KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2001), 38–72.&lt;/ref&gt; A simplification of this view states that suffering exists as a means of spiritual development. In other words, God allows suffering so that human souls might grow or develop towards maturation. For Hick, God is ultimately responsible for pain and suffering, but such things are not truly bad. Perhaps with a greater degree of perception, one can see that the "evil" we experience through suffering is not ultimately evil but good, as such is used to "make our souls" better.

Therefore, Hick sees the evils of pain and suffering as serving God’s good purpose of bringing "imperfect and immature" humanity to itself  "in uncompelled faith and love."&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "D. Z. Phillips on God and Evil," ''Religious Studies '', Vol. 43, No. 2, posted on www.johnhick.org.uk/article18.html  (accessed 3 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the after-life, Hick asserts that "God will eventually succeed in His purpose of winning all men to Himself."&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', Palgrave Macmillan, (2nd edition), 1977, p.342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of evil in Hick has been challenged by a number of theologians and moral philosophers including [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]] and [[John K. Roth]]. Using Hick's own words, Roth has stated, "Hick's theodicy is implausible to me because I am convinced that his claims about God's goodness cannot stand the onslaught of what he calls the principal threat to his own perspective: 'the sheer amount and intensity of both moral and natural evil.'"&lt;ref&gt;Roth, John. ''Encountering Evil'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Encountering Evil'', Stephen Davis has stated his four criticisms of Hick, "First, while no theodicy is free of difficulties, I believe Hick's is not entirely convincing in its handling of the amount of evil that exists in the world... Second, I am dubious about Hick's hope of a gradual spiritual evolution till human beings reach a full state of God-consciousness... Third, I believe Hick also faces what I call the 'cost-effective' criticism of the free will defense... My final and most serious criticism of Hick concerns his commitment to universalism."&lt;ref&gt;''Encountering Evil'', p. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[religion]] is hard to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who defined it as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."&lt;ref&gt;(Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;}} A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category."&lt;ref&gt;(Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and [[sacred history|sacred histories]] that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the universe. They tend to derive [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s, or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]]. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com|title=World Religions Religion Statistics Geography Church Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''religion'' is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[faith]]" or "belief system", but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized [[religious behaviour|behaviours]], including [[clergy|clerical hierarchies]], a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, [[local church|congregations]] of [[laity]], regular meetings or services for the purposes of [[veneration]] of a [[deity]] or for [[prayer]], [[shrine|holy places]] (either natural or architectural) or [[religious text]]s. Certain religions also have a [[sacred language]] often used in [[liturgy|liturgical]] services. The practice of a religion may also include [[sermon]]s, commemoration of the activities of a [[god]] or gods, [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]], [[ritual]]s, [[rite]]s, [[ceremonies]], [[worship]], [[initiation]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[marriage]]s, [[meditation]], [[invocation]], [[mediumship]], [[religious music|music]], [[religious art|art]], [[sacred dance|dance]], [[Community service|public service]] or other aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] [[phenomena]] such as [[out-of-body experience]]s, [[near-death experience]]s and [[reincarnation]], along with many other [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parapsych.org/base/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iands.org/about-ndes/key-nde-facts.html|title=Key Facts about Near-Death Experiences|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics [[Religious studies|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories: [[major religious groups|world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], international faiths; [[Ethnic religion|indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and [[new religious movement]]s, which refers to recently developed faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. Page 06.&lt;/ref&gt; One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and thus religion, as a concept, has been [[Reification (fallacy)|applied inappropriately]] to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.{{further information|Prehistoric religion|History of religion}}

[[Image:Religion in SF.png|thumb|300px|Science fiction often portrays real religions being exported to alien planets]]
[[Science fiction]] will sometimes address the topic of [[religion]]. Often [[List of religious ideas in fantasy fiction|religious themes]] are used to convey a broader message, but others confront the subject head-on—contemplating, for example, how attitudes towards faith might shift in the wake of ever-advancing technological progress, or offering creative scientific explanations for the apparently mystical events related in religious texts (gods as aliens, prophets as time travelers, etc.).  As an exploratory medium, science fiction rarely takes religion at face value by simply accepting or rejecting it; when religious themes are presented, they tend to be investigated deeply.

Some science fiction works portray invented religions, either placed into a contemporary Earth society (such as the [[Earthseed]] religion in [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Parable of the Sower]]''), or in the far future (as seen in ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by [[Frank Herbert]], with its [[Orange Catholic Bible]]).  Other works examine the role of existing religions in a futuristic or alternate society.  The classic [[Canticle for Leibowitz]] explores a world in which [[Catholicism]] is one of the few institutions to survive an apocalypse, and chronicles its slow re-achievement of prominence as civilisation returns.

[[Christian science fiction]] also exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John| last=Mort| title=Christian Fiction: a Guide to the genre| publisher=Libraries Unlimited| year=2002| isbn=1-56308-871-1| pages=159–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes written as [[allegory]] for inspirational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sammons| first=Martha C.| title="A Better Country": The Worlds of Religious Fantasy and Science Fiction| publisher=Greenwood Press| year=1988| isbn=0-313-25746-9| page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orson Scott Card]] has criticized the genre for oversimplifying religion, which he claims is always shown as "ridiculous and false".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing-world.com/sf/card.shtml "On Religion in SF and Fantasy: An Interview with Orson Scott Card"]; Writing World online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angels==
{{See also|Angels|List of fictional angels}}

*In ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' (1938; part of the [[Space Trilogy]]), by [[C. S. Lewis]], the protagonist meets "eldila", mysterious beings of light native to the void of interplanetary space (who are actually what Christianity defines as "angels", and who are also identified as [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and other deities of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]), and are completely loyal and obedient to God, and have never wanted to be worshiped as gods themselves (although the ancient Greeks and Romans mistakenly did so)

==Creation myths==
{{See also|Creation myth|Cosmogony}}

* The film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) explores the myth that human life did not arise spontaneously by chance, but that a humanoid species, the "Engineers", [[Ancient astronauts in popular culture|created life on Earth]]. They also taught humans how to use technology and visited the Earth sporadically.  Some elements are similar to the [[Ancient Aliens]] myths.  The story develops when a scientific expedition travels to confront their creators.{{disputed inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- this template replaced the text &amp;lt;sup&gt;[Not a creation myth?]&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;
* In the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) based on [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', Roy Batty is an [[Android (robot)|artificial person]] looking to confront his creator, while Rick Deckard searches for lost humanity despite his job: hunting and "retiring" runaway [[replicants]].{{disputed inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- this template replaced the text &amp;lt;sup&gt;[Not a creation myth?]&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;

* The short story ''[[The Last Question]]'' (1956) by [[Isaac Asimov]] – Humans of the future ask the [[supercomputer]] [[Multivac]] how the net amount of [[entropy]] of the universe can be massively decreased. Multivac fails, displaying the error message "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER". The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally [[heat death of the universe|the universe dies]] with the exception of Cosmic AC – Multivac's final successor. At that point it has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Multivac drew all of humanity into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Multivac did decipher the answer, announcing "[[Let there be light|Let there be light!]]".
* The early part of [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' provides a detailed Creation myth, with the world being created through the singing of [[Angel]]-like beings under the direction of God. Similar to the [[Christian]] account of [[The War in Heaven]], this myth includes the rebellion of Melkor (equivalent of [[Lucifer]]/[[Satan]]) but considerably different in detail from the Christian account.

==Demons==
{{See also|Demons|List of fictional demons}}

* In the [[Doom series|''Doom'' series]] demons from Hell have come into the universe through an inter-dimensional portal which is located on Mars.
* In ''[[Princess of Wands]]'' by [[John Ringo]], a Christian housewife and soccer mom gets involved in an organization which co-operates with the FBI in dealing with demons.
* In ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], the villains of the story are guided by beings they call "macrobes" which are clearly meant to be demons.
* In ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' series, some of the villains of the story appear to be demons, beings of immense power and strength. They can be summoned by certain groups of people with arcane knowledge. They are known as daemons, and the people who hunt them, daemon hunters.

==Devil==
{{See also|Devil|Devil in popular culture}}

* The TV series, ''[[Futurama]]'', features a recurring character called the [[Robot Devil]]
* In the 1975 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Pyramids of Mars]]", the Doctor states that Satan is one of the names the last of the Osirians, Sutekh (who considers all life his enemy), is known by.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor: "Serve you, Sutekh? Your name is abominated in every civilized world, whether that name be Set, Satan, Sodos..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1978 sci-fi TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', the two part episode "[[War of the Gods (Battlestar Galactica)|War Of The Gods]]" features a character very much like the Devil who is portrayed by Patrick Macnee. His name is [[Count Iblis]] — Iblis being the Islamic name of the Devil.
* The 2006 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes "[[The Impossible Planet]]" and "[[The Satan Pit]]" feature an ancient being known as the Beast, which claims to be the basis of the Devil figure in all religions and mythologies; earlier in "[[The Dæmons]]", it is shown a race resembling the typical image of the Devil had visited Earth and become the basis for both Gods and Demons.
* In ''[[Perelandra]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], the protagonist must fight against a man possessed by a demon, hinted to be the devil himself.
* ''[[Ubik]]'' (1969) by [[Philip K. Dick]] - In the novel a company uses a form of [[cryonic]] suspension to give deceased limited consciousness and the ability to communicate. Ella is in such a state of "half-life" and instructs the protagonist who also appears to be in such a state on the usage of the spray "Ubik", whose name is derived from the Latin word "[[ubiquitous|ubique]]" (meaning "everywhere") which can preserve people who are in half-life. As the protagonist finds himself in an increasingly regressing world it is discovered that Jory Miller, another half-lifer, is the cause of this as he devours the life force of other people who are in [[suspended animation]] in order to prolong his own existence. While Ubik can be seen as a metaphor for God&lt;ref name="tessa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fitting/&gt; Jory Miller can be seen as an allegorical representation of the Devil.&lt;ref name=fitting&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitting|first1=Peter|title=''Ubik'': The Deconstruction of Bourgeois SF|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/5/fitting5art.htm|website=depauw.edu|publisher=Science Fiction Studies|accessdate=27 June 2015|date=March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the episode [[Rick and Morty (season 1)#ep9|"Something Ricked This Way Comes"]] (2014) of the science fiction comedy television series ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' a character "Summer" reports to her first job in an antique shop run by the Devil that sells items that fulfill a desire for the owner but come at a price making the item essentially worthless (the shop and the Devil's name, Mr. Needful, are both references and parodies of the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Needful Things]]''). During the episode a protagonist "Rick" sets up a competitive counter-business across the street that removes the [[curse]]s and runs the Devil out of business. The Devil is so dismayed that he tries to kill himself but Summer finds himself in the middle of his [[suicide]] attempt and revives him. They relaunch with a new dot-com company that becomes wildly successful. As it turns out, the Devil had no plans to include Summer in reaping the profits and has her hauled off by security. Betrayed by the Devil, she and Rick build muscle mass to get physical revenge.

==Eschatology and the ultimate fate of the universe==
{{See also|Eschatology|Ultimate fate of the universe|:Category:End of the universe in fiction}}
&lt;!--todo: descriptions/summaries--&gt;
* In the far future of ''[[Le Dernier Homme]]'' (1805) by [[Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville]] Earth is becoming sterile and the human ability to reproduce is failing. A man travels to the last fertile woman to begin a rebirth of the human race and at return meets [[Adam]], the first man, who has been condemned by God to watch all the damned among his descendants enter Hell, and is now charged with persuading the pair not to prolong the life of humanity, which God has determined must now end. The world then begins to end the dead to rise from their graves while Ormus, the spirit of Earth, who cannot survive without humanity, despairs.
* ''[[Omega: The Last Days of the World]]'' (1894) by [[Camille Flammarion]]
* The poem ''[[Darkness (poem)|Darkness]]'' (1816) by [[Lord Byron]]
* ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937) by [[Olaf Stapledon]]

* ''[[The Last Question]]'' (1956) by [[Isaac Asimov]] (see [[#Creation myths]])
* ''[[City at the End of Time]]'' (2008) by [[Greg Bear]]
* ''[[That Extraordinary Day]]'' (2012) by [[Predrag Vukadinović]]
* At the end of ''[[Tau Zero]]'' (1970) by [[Poul Anderson]] the universe collapses in a [[big crunch]] and then explodes in a new [[big bang]]. However, the starship with the book's protagonists on board survives because there is still enough uncondensed hydrogen for maneuvering, outside the monobloc, and eventually they could colonize one of the new universe's planets.
* ''[[Manifold: Time]]'' (1999) by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] begins at the end of space and time, when the last descendants of humanity face an infinite but pointless existence. Due to [[proton decay]] the physical universe has collapsed, but some form of intelligence has survived by embedding itself into a lossless computing substrate where it can theoretically survive indefinitely.  However, because there will never be new input, eventually all possible thoughts will be exhausted.  Some portion of this intelligence decides that this should not have been the [[ultimate fate of the universe]], and takes action to change the past, centering around the early 21st century.
* ''[[Left Behind]]'' is a series of 16 best-selling novels by [[Tim LaHaye]] and [[Jerry B. Jenkins]], dealing with [[Christianity|Christian]] [[dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] [[End Times]]: the [[Pretribulationism|pretribulation]], [[Premillennialism|premillennial]], [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatological]] viewpoint of the [[apocalypse|end of the world]]. The primary conflict of the series is the members of the Tribulation Force against the [[Global Community]] and its leader [[Nicolae Carpathia]]—the [[Antichrist]].  ''Left Behind'' is also the title of the first book in the series. The series was first published 1995–2007 by [[Tyndale House]], a firm with a history of interest in [[dispensationalism]].

==Evangelism==
{{See also|Evangelism}}

* In [[S. M. Stirling]]'s [[Nantucket series|''Nantucket'' series]], the entire island of [[Nantucket]] is suddenly transported into the past, to about 1300 BC and the modern Americans marooned in the past must make the best of the Bronze Age world in which they find themselves; the Christians among them face the dilemma of whether or not to embark on missionary activity and spread their religion - even though Jesus Christ had not yet been born, and the very act of their spreading Christianity might so fundamentally change the world that Jesus might never be born at all
* In ''[[The Sparrow (novel)|The Sparrow]]'', by [[Mary Doria Russell]], most of the Jesuit missionaries sent to investigate a radio transmission from an unknown planet (believing that they have been chosen by God to be the first to set foot on an alien world) are killed by the planet's inhabitants; and the sole survivor is enslaved but eventually escapes and returns to Earth with his faith in tatters

==Fictional religions==
{{See also|List of fictional religions}}
&lt;!--Inclusion criteria: there has to be an article on the fictional religion or at least a considerable coverage of it in the book's/film's article.--&gt;

* A main theme of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968) is the fictional religion "[[Mercerism]]". It is Earth's main religion, in which Empathy Boxes link simultaneous users into a [[collective consciousness]] based on the suffering of Wilbur Mercer. In the shared experience of the Empathy Box, Wilbur Mercer takes an endless walk up a mountain while stones are thrown at him, the pain of which all users share. Television broadcasts of "Buster Friendly" represent a second religion, designed to undermine Mercerism.
* The [[Earthseed]] religion in [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]''
* The [[Vedek (Star Trek)|Bajoran religion]] – ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''
* ''Cavism'' in [[Gore Vidal]]'s novel ''[[Messiah (Vidal novel)|Messiah ]]'' - a religion founded by John Cave, an American undertaker. Cave teaches, among other things, not to fear death and to actually desire it under certain circumstances. Later followers come to glorify death, and even enforce it on other members. The founder John Cave is himself ironically killed by his followers when he proves inconvenient for the new religion's development. Cavism eventually completely displaces and destroys Christianity, even to the extent of all [[Gothic Cathedrals]] being blown up and destroyed to erase all trace of it.
* The [[Klingon culture#Religion|Klingon religion]] and various other religions from ''[[Star Trek]]''
* [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Buddislam]], Maometh Saari, [[Mahayana Christianity]], [[Zensunni|Zensunni Catholicism]] in [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series
* [[Bokononism]] and  in ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]]
* [[Chernobog]], the Satanic, cannibalistic, human-sacrificing god whose worship displaced Christianity in the remnants of [[Russia]] in the post-apocalyptic world of [[The Peshawar Lancers]] by [[S. M. Stirling]].  
* [[Church of All Worlds]] (inspired a non-fictional religious group of the same name) and other religions from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]
* Church of the Second Chance in [[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Riverworld]] series.
* [[Cylon (reimagining)#Religion|Cylon]] monotheistic religion – ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''
* [[Lexx#Divine Order|Divine Order of His Shadow]] – ''[[Lexx]]'' TV series
* [[Religion in Futurama|Robotology, Robot Judaism, The First Amalgamated Church and other religions]] from the animated television program ''[[Futurama]]''
* [[Foundationism]] – ''[[Babylon 5]]''
* [[After Ford|Fordism]] – ''[[Brave New World]]''
* The [[Philosophy and religion in Star Wars|various religions]] ([[Sith]], [[Jedi]]) of ''[[Star Wars]]''
* Gorgolorism. In L. Sprague de Camp's ''The Goblin Tower'', the city state of Tarxia is a theocracy dominated by the priesthood of the frog god Gorgolor, who is cinsidered the One True God. In other places, Gorgolor is just a minor god in a big Pantheon. However, saying that in Tarxia might result in being burned as a heretic.
* [[Goa'uld]] religion – most Goa'uld pose as gods to control slave armies. "Goa'uld" means "God" in the [[Goa'uld language]] from the television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''
* Hemilkism in ''[[The Gate of Time]]'' by [[Philip José Farmer]] - in an [[alternate history]] where there never was a [[Roman Empire]] and European culture has many [[Abrahamic religions|Semitic]] elements, a major religion was founded in the Fourteenth Century by a charismatic Irish religious figure named [[Hamilcar |Hemilka]]. While having some resemblances to Christianity, Hemilkism is not an imperialist faith and therefore does not dominate its world in the way Christianity does in ours.
* Monism (specifically, Evangelical Monism) in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]''. In the last decades of the 21st Century, great waves of Monist proselyting swept out of [[Persia]] and numerous Westerners were converted. Two generations later, when the plot takes place, Evangelical Monism is one of the main religious denominations in the US, many American families observing the Monist ritual of lighting the Lamp of Peace during dinner. From references in the book, the Monist faith appears to be [[Deist]]ic, with a generalized acceptance of a deity having no particular defining characteristics or abilities, and including significant elements of [[Fire worship]] - suggesting the influence [[Mazdaism]], the pre-Islamic fire-worshiping religion of Persia. For such a religion to be strongly established in modern Persia/Iran implies a major upheaval in the position of Islam there - for which Heinlein provides no information [http://members.iglou.com/jtmajor/TunlSky.htm]. 
* [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] religion - the main antagonist in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' after the fall of the [[Goa'uld]]. Ori, ascended beings, relatives and mortal enemies of the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], thrive on the life force stolen from their worshippers. The clash is finally resolved in the movie ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''.
* [[Church of Science]] – the bogus religion established by [[Salvor Hardin]] in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''
* ''Soterism'' - in the [[alternate history]] of [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Aristotle and the Gun]]'', Christianity never arose. Its place during the Roman Empire was taken by Soterism, an Egypto-Hellenic synthesis founded by a fiery Egyptian prophet, whose followers called him "Soter" - the Greek word for "Savior". Soterism did not become as powerful as  Christianity in the history we know, with [[Mitraism]] and [[Odin]]ism surviving at its side. In later times, followers of these religions hounded the scientist Georg Schwartzhorn (much as [[Galileo]] was persecuted in our history).   
* [[Church of Humanity Unchained]] - the primary religion of the [[Grayson (Honorverse)|Grayson]] and [[List of locations in the Honorverse#M|Masada]] systems in the [[Honorverse]]. (Two churches, with one origin, but now mutually implacably hostile, with massively different theologies.)
* In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s story "Equinoctial"&lt;ref&gt;Included in "Picnic on Nearside", New York, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Rings of Saturn]] are inhabited by the followers of two mutually-antagonistic religions. ''The Church of Cosmic Engineering'' (informally ''The Engineers''), founded by Ringpainter the Great, considers it a Sacred Duty to paint red the Rings of Saturn - a duty holy enough to be worth the devoting of one's entire lifetime to it. The opposing ''Conservationist Church'' (''Consers'' in short) is equally certain that painting the Rings is the Ultimate Sacrilege and that undoing all such painting ''is'' the task to which one should devote one's life. The two are involved in a centuries-long, fierce [[religious war]] - both equally certain that the issue of painting or unpainting the Rings fully justifies killing on sight any member of the opposing Church (see [[Eight Worlds#Symbiotic spacesuits]]).

==God or deities==

* ''[[Absolution Gap]]'' by [[Alastair Reynolds]]
* In the film [[Avatar (2009 film)|''Avatar'']] (2009), the [[Pandoran biosphere#Naʼvi|Na'vi]], an alien race, worship a goddess named Eywa

The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally [[heat death of the universe|the universe dies]] with the exception of Cosmic AC – Multivac's final successor. At that point it has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself.

''Elizabeth Shaw'': You said you could figure out their navigation....use their maps.&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': Yes, of course. Once we get to one of their other ships...finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': I don't want to go back to where we came from...I want to go where they came from...I want to go to paradise. You think you can do that, David?&lt;br/&gt;

''Elizabeth Shaw'': They created us. And they tried to kill us. They changed their minds. I deserve to know why.&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': Does it matter why they changed their minds?&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': Heh. Yeah...yes, it does.&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': I don't understand.&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': Well, I guess that's because I'm a human being...and you're a fucking robot. Do you mind?&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': Mind?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Shaw has been portrayed as a deeply religious person&lt;ref name=alternatescene/&gt; whose first encounter with the concept of heaven or paradise stems from when her mother died – a memory David coexperienced during Shaw's [[Sleeper ship|hypersleep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prometheus Quotes: Striking Concept|url=http://www.moviequotesandmore.com/prometheus-quotes.html#1|accessdate=5 August 2015|quote=[on the ship, Prometheus, David checks on the crew who are in hypersleep, he gazes upon Shaw and sees what she's dreaming of, which is from her childhood when she is with her father in a foreign land looking at a funeral procession]&lt;br/&gt;''Young Shaw'': What happened to that man?&lt;br/&gt;''Shaw's Father'': He died.&lt;br/&gt;''Young Shaw'': Why aren't you helping them?&lt;br/&gt;''Shaw's Father'': They don't want my help.

''David (AI)'': "Thing;" Dr. Shaw? Not too long ago, you considered them gods.&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': God never tried to kill me. So... what did he say? Where did he come from?&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': There is no direct translation, but... Several of your ancient cultures had a word similar to it... "Paradise"&lt;br/&gt;

* [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'', takes place in an [[alternate timeline]] in which "Jesus Christ had been born into a liberal and progressive Roman Empire that spread from the Arctic Ocean to the Bight of Benin, and was to know no Decline and Fall" &lt;ref&gt;"A Modern Utopia," Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; - with profound implications for Jesus' religious teachings, and later on those of [[Muhammad]]
* In ''[[Behold the Man (novel)|Behold the Man]]'', by [[Michael Moorcock]], twentieth-century [[Karl Glogauer]] (a Jew obsessed with the figures of Jesus and [[Carl Jung]]), travels in time to the year 28 A.D. where he meets various New Testament figures (such as [[John the Baptist]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]), and discovers that Mary and Joseph's child, Jesus, is a mentally retarded hunchback, who could never become the Jesus as is portrayed in the Scriptures, and after having a mental breakdown, steps into the role of Jesus, eventually dying on the cross (having specifically asked [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] to betray him)
* In ''[[The Didymus Contingency]]'', by [[Jeremy Robinson]], a scientist's time-travel to see Jesus' death and resurrection—only to witness several scenes not recorded in the New Testament (while realizing Jesus was a fraud)—faces the dilemma of whether or not to make a revelation in the present which would shake the foundations of Christianity is complicated further with the appearance of an assassin from a different future...&lt;ref&gt;Note: The Didymus of the title is the [[Thomas the Apostle|Apostle Saint Thomas]], whose initial skepticism of the resurrection earned him the title "[[Doubting Thomas]]".&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Last Starship from Earth]]'', by [[John Boyd (author)|John Boyd]], is set in a ''[[dystopian]]'' society in the very near future (in an alternate timeline) where Jesus Christ became a revolutionary agitator and was never subjected to crucifixion; and who overthrew the Roman Empire by force of arms, and established a theocracy that has lasted until the twentieth century
* In [[Garry Kilworth]]'s story ''[[Let's Go to Golgotha!]]'', tourists from the future can book a time-traveling "Crucifixion Tour", but before setting out, they are strictly told that, when the crowd is asked whether Jesus or [[Barabbas]] should be spared, they must all join the call: "Give us Barabbas!"—however, when the moment comes, the protagonist suddenly realizes that the crowd condemning Jesus to the cross is composed ''entirely'' of tourists from the future, and that no actual Jewish Israelites of 33 A.D. are present at all
* When the protagonists of [[Clifford Simak]]'s ''[[Mastodonia]]'' make trips to the past commercially available, American church groups band together and seek to purchase an exclusive franchise for Jesus' time on Earth—not because they want to go there but because they do not want anyone at all to go there (the clergymen state quite forthrightly their apprehension that time travel would disprove some of the accounts given in the Gospels and thus undermine Christianity)—when refused, the church groups turn aggressive and energetically lobby Congress to ban time travel altogether; opening an enormous theological debate unresolved by the end of the book
* [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1949 story "The Man," reprinted in ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'', tells of a miracle worker who matches the description of Jesus and who travels from planet to planet, healing and teaching. When a spaceship lands on one such planet and is told that the miracle worker had been there just the day before, the arrogant captain vows to chase him down through space until he catches him. After the captain blasts off again in search of the man, another spaceman, who chose to remain behind because of his faith having been awakened by the faith of the people on that planet, is told that the man is still there.
* In ''[[The Rescuer]]'', by [[Arthur Porges]], future scientists destroy a three-billion dollar time-travel project because a religious fanatic had taken over the machine, heading for [[Golgotha]] with a rifle and five thousand rounds in an attempt to save Jesus and the affair must be kept from the public, since some might identify with "The Rescuer"

* In ''[[There Will Be Time]]'', by [[Poul Anderson]], a young twentieth-century American (who has discovered that he has the ability to travel through time without any need of a machine) reasons that there must be others like him and that Jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion is a good place to try locating them, goes there and walks through the street singing the Greek mass (which is meaningless to people of the time), but get himself located by agents of a time-travel policing organization, who take him to their headquarters in the far future—without getting to see Jesus at all
* In the ''[[TimeWars]]'' series by [[Simon Hawke]], set in 2461, Cardinal Lodovico Consorti proposes to use the recently discovered time-travel technology to obtain empirical proof that Christ indeed rose from the dead after being crucified, causing the Catholic Church to excommunicate him (the Church hierarchy preferring to continue relying on faith alone and not seeking factual confirmation)
* ''[[Times Without Number]]'', by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], depicts an alternate reality in which the [[Spanish Armada]] had conquered England; and when time travel is discovered—controlled by the Catholic Church—it is decreed that every new pope would be privileged to travel to Palestine in the time of Christ's ministry, while everyone else is strictly forbidden to go there
* In ''[[The Traveller (1954 novel)|The Traveller]]'', by [[Richard Matheson]], a confirmed skeptic is chosen to be the first to travel in time to see the crucifixion (in a kind of traveling cage which makes him invisible to the people of the past) and he witnesses the actual event, causing him to feel empathy for Jesus; and is hauled back to the present after attempting to save him; and, although he had seen no miracles, he is a changed man, having seen "a man giving up his life for the things he believed" and stating, "that should be miracle enough for everybody"
* The plot of ''[[Jesus Video]]'', a German novel by [[Andreas Eschbach]], revolves around the search for a hidden video camera that is believed to hold digital footage of Jesus recorded by a time traveler&lt;ref&gt;Note: The book, written in 1997, was adapted into a television movie called ''Das Jesus Video'' in 2002. The film was released in English under the title ''The Hunt for the Hidden Relic'' (or ''Hidden Relic'').&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Robert Silverberg]]'s ''[[Up the Line]]'', featuring a company organizing tours into the past, a character notes that "the crowd at the [[Sermon on the Mount]] grows bigger and bigger, every time I go there again"
* In one of the episodes of [[Philip José Farmer]]'s Riverworld series, Jesus was resurrected in a manner completely different from that depicted in Christian theology. Along with millions of other people from all times and places in history, he was given a new, completely human, life along the banks of a mysterious long river on another planet. In this depiction, the revived Jesus is a Jew who never intended to found a new religion, and when encountering Christians from later ages he does not recognize himself in the Divine Jesus which they believe in. He is delighted to encounter an Israelite woman who took part in the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt and whose eye-witness account of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron|Aharon]] is substantially different from that in the Bible. Eventually Jesus is tortured to death by a rabidly antisemitic Medieval German Baron, who angrily rejects the very idea that this Jew might be Jesus. Before dying again, Jesus cries out: "Father, they ''do'' know what they are doing!". &lt;ref&gt;Published in "Down in the Black Gang" (1971) {{ISBN|0-451-04805-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Another Son of God==

* In the [[alternate history]] timeline of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[In High Places (Turtledove novel)|In High Places]]'', in which the [[Black Plague]] was much worse than in our history, there appeared in the city of [[Avignon]] at that time of crisis a charismatic religious leader named Henri, claiming to be "The Second Son of God". He was executed as a heretic. However, on the day after his execution, the church where the Pope and the King of France were worshiping collapsed, killing both of them. This was taken as an act of Divine Retribution and a proof of Henri's claim. Therefore, the worship of Henri as the Second Son of God was officially taken up by the Catholic Church. The life of Henri was described in "The Final Testament", added to the [[New Testament]] (with the name implying that the Church would not welcome any Third Son); churches were henceforward built with two towers, standing for Jesus and Henri; since Henri was [[broken on a wheel]], the Wheel became the symbol of Christianity instead of the Cross; and Avignon remained the permanent seat of the Papacy and became a holy city, with pilgrims flocking to the locations associated with Henri's life and martyrdom. In later times, Christians tended in times of crisis to call on Henri rather than on Jesus. This upheaval in Christian theology had the effect of deepening the hostility between Christianity and  [[Islam]]. The Muslims - grown very powerful due to the Black Plague devastating Europe - [[Jesus in Islam| respected Jesus as a Prophet]], but refused to accord any such status to Henri.
* [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] story ''The Lingering Joy'', a sequel to [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Long Remembering'' &lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Multiverse: Exploring Poul Anderson's Worlds, ed. Greg bear and Gardner Dozois, [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;, depicts a world on the brink of destruction in [[nuclear war]]. A young woman, the story's protagonist, embarks on a kind of "mental time travel", enabling her to experience the life of a Prehistoric ancestress. Her main motivation is religious: to find out whether the [[Incarnation of Jesus]] was a single and unique event, or if God had before incarnated among the Neanderthals, to bring salvation to them, too. She experiences the life of a remote ancestress, a rebellious young Cro-Magnon woman who seeks to prove that she can be the equal of her tribe's male hunters. But while in courage and skill she is fully their equal, she cannot match the male hunters' ruthless cruelty. When visiting the last remaining enclave of the ''Goblins'' (Neanderthals), on the verge of final extinction, she cannot help feeling empathy and compassion for a male Goblin whose mate was raped and murdered by a male of her own tribe. And then she encounters the miraculous baby who was born to the doomed Goblins, his birth heralded by a strange new star which blazed in the sky, tens of thousands of years before the [[Star of Bethlehem]]...

But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then, again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revaluation of prominent historical figures".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Orwell]], [http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Prevention_of_Literature/0.html "The Prevention of Literature"], ''Polemic'' (January 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42986">'''Morality and religion''' is the relationship between [[religion|religious]] views and [[morals]]. Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Gems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Zoroastrianism#Principal beliefs|Zoroastrianism's]] "good thoughts, good words, and good deeds" concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|edition= |last= Esptein|first= Greg M.|year= 2010|publisher= HarperCollins|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-06-167011-4|page= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frameworks are outlined and interpreted by various sources such as holy books, oral and written traditions, and religious leaders. Many of these share tenets with [[secular]] value frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], and [[utilitarianism]].

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not necessarily depend upon religion, though for some, this is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Rachels| first1 = (ed) James | last2 =  Rachels | first2 = (ed) Stuart | title = The Elements of Moral Philosophy | publisher = McGraw-Hill| edition = 7 | year = 2011| location = New York| page = | isbn = 0-07-803824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'', religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress| first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie| first2 = (ed) John  | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press| edition = | year = 1986| location = Philadelphia| page = 401| isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the views of others, the two can overlap. According to one definition, morality is an active process which is, "at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason, that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing, while giving equal consideration to the interests of all those affected by what one does."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt;

[[Value judgment]]s can vary greatly between religions, past and present. People in various religious traditions, such as [[Christianity]], may derive ideas of right and wrong from the rules and laws set forth in their respective authoritative guides and by their religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|edition= | authorlink = Simon Blackburn|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equating morality to adherence to authoritative commands in a holy book is the [[Divine Command Theory]].&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt; [[Polytheistic]] religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] generally draw from some of the broadest canons of religious works.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhippriya Subhadra Siriwardena, [http://www.lankaweb.com/dhamma/view12.html 'The Buddhist perspective of lay morality'], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; There has been interest in the relationship between religion and crime and other behavior that does not adhere to contemporary laws and [[social norm]]s in various countries. Studies conducted in recent years have explored these relationships, but the results have been mixed and sometimes contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Saint George, [http://www.prisoners.com/relcrime.html "Religion's Effects On  Crime Rates"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of religious faiths to provide value frameworks that are seen as useful is a debated matter. Religious commentators have asserted that a moral life cannot be led without an [[Divine law|absolute lawgiver]] as a guide. Other observers assert that moral behavior does not rely on religious tenets, and secular commentators point to ethical challenges within various religions that conflict with contemporary social norms.

== Relationship between religion and morality ==
Within the wide range of ethical traditions, religious traditions co-exist with secular value frameworks such as [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others. There are many types of religious values. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] (and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]]) define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective gods and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. [[Polytheistic]] religious traditions tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances play roles in determining whether an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Morgan, "Buddhism." In {{cite book |title = Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition = Second|editor1-first =  Peggy|editor1-last = Morgan|editor2-first = Clive A. | editor2-last = Lawton|year = 2007|publisher = Columbia University Press|location = |isbn = 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages = 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Stoler Miller]] points out a further disparity between the morals of religious traditions, stating that in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last =  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher = Random House|location = New York|isbn = 0-553-21365-2 |page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen Gaukroger]]: "It was generally assumed in the 17th century that religion provided the unique basis for morality, and that without religion, there could be no morality."&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"&gt;{{cite book |title = Objectivity: A Very Short Introduction|edition = |last = Gaukroger|first = Stephen|year = 2012|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-960669-6|page = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view slowly shifted over time. In 1690, [[Pierre Bayle]] asserted that religion "is neither necessary nor sufficient for morality".&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"/&gt; Modern sources separate the two concepts. For example, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' says that, &lt;blockquote&gt;For many religious people, morality and religion are the same or inseparable; for them either morality is part of religion or their religion is their morality. For others, especially for nonreligious people, morality and religion are distinct and separable; religion may be immoral or nonmoral, and morality may or should be nonreligious. Even for some religious people the two are different and separable; they may hold that religion should be moral and morality should be, but they agree that they may not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress | first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie | first2 = (ed) John | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press | edition = | year = 1986 | location = Philadelphia | page = 400 | isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richard Paula and Linda Elder of the Foundation for Critical Thinking assert that, "Most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs, and the law." They separate the concept of ethics from these topics, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;The proper role of ethical reasoning is to highlight acts of two kinds: those which enhance the well-being of others—that warrant our praise—and those that harm or diminish the well-being of others—and thus warrant our criticism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|edition = |last1 = Paul|first1 = Richard|last2 = Elder|first2 = Linda|year = 2006|publisher = Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location = United States|isbn = 0-944583-17-2|pages = np}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; They note problems that could arise if religions defined ethics, such as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

# religious practices like "torturing unbelievers or burning them alive" potentially being labeled "ethical"
# the lack of a common religious baseline across humanity because religions provide different theological definitions for the idea of [[sin]]

They further note that various documents, such as the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]] lay out "transcultural" and "trans-religious" ethical concepts and principles—such as slavery, genocide, torture, sexism, racism, murder, assault, fraud, deceit, and intimidation—which require no reliance on religion (or social convention) for us to understand they are "ethically wrong".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Armin Geertz suggests that "the age-old assumption that religion produces morals and values is neither the only, nor the most parsimonious, hypothesis for religion".&lt;ref&gt;

== Religious frameworks ==
Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski, "Hinduism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as [[abortion]] or [[divorce]]. In the latter case, a 2008 study by the Barna Group found that some denominations have a significantly higher divorce rate than those in non-religious demographic groups (atheists and agnostics). However Catholics and Evangelical Christians had the lowest divorce rates and the agnostic/atheist group had by far the lowest number of married couples to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|title= New Marriage and Divorce Statistics Released|author= Barna Group|date= 31 March 2008|publisher= Barna Group|accessdate= 19 November 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141219120231/http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|archivedate= 19 December 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Dixon, "Many today&amp;nbsp;... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| pages = 115| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] Ron Rhodes has remarked that "it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/Atheism.html|title=Strategies for Dialoguing with Atheists|author=Ron Rhodes|publisher=[http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/ Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries]|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Dixon states, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"/&gt;

== Religion and social dimensions ==

The study of religion and morality is contentious due to conceptual differences.  The ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definition of religiosity all contribute to conflicting findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=R|last2=Whitehouse|first2=H|title=Religion and morality.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 2015|volume=141|issue=2|pages=447–73|doi=10.1037/a0038455|pmid=25528346|pmc=4345965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=Does religious belief promote prosociality? A critical examination.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=876–906|doi=10.1037/a0028251|pmid=22925142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership of a religious group can accentuate biases in behavior toward in group versus out group members, which may explain the lower number of interracial friends and greater approval of torture among church members.  Furthermore, some studies have shown that religious prosociality is primarily motivated by wanting to appear prosocial, which may be related to the desire to further ones religious group.  The egoistically motivated prosociality may also affect self-reports, resulting in biased results. Peer ratings can be biased by stereotypes, and indications of a persons group affiliation are sufficient to bias reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=The complex and elusive nature of religious prosociality: reply to Myers (2012) and Saroglou (2012).|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=918–23|doi=10.1037/a0029278|pmid=22925145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are racially segregated, and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach? A Meta-Analytic Review of Religious Racism|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=16 December 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=126–139|doi=10.1177/1088868309352179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to global research done by Gallup on people from 145 countries, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week reported higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders). Even for people who were nonreligious, those who said they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stark|first1=Rodney|last2=Smith|first2=Buster G.|title=Religious Attendance Relates to Generosity Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/122807/religious-attendance-relates-generosity-worldwide.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another global study by Gallup on people from 140 countries showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite them having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crabtree|first1=Steve|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett|title=Worldwide, Highly Religious More Likely to Help Others|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/111013/worldwide-highly-religious-more-likely-help-others.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study on [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments showed that non-religious people were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people were less inclined when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers] by Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura R.

The overall relationship between faith and [[crime]] is unclear.

A 2005 study by [[Gregory S.

Modern research in [[Relationship between criminology and sociology of education|criminology]] also acknowledges an inverse relationship between religion and crime,&lt;ref&gt;As is stated in: Doris C. Chu (2007). Religiosity and Desistance From Drug Use. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 2007; 34; 661 originally published online Mar 7, 2007; {{doi|10.1177/0093854806293485}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some studies establishing this connection.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded, "religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Baier, C. J.,&amp; Wright, B. R. (2001). "If you love me, keep my commandments":A meta-analysis of the effect of religion on crime. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency,38,3–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in his books about the materialism in Americas Evangelical Churches [[Ron Sider]] accuses fellow Christians of failing to do better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Ronald J. Sider, ''The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience: Why Are Christians Living Just Like the Rest of the World?'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2005). Sider quotes extensively from polling research by [[The Barna Group]] showing that moral behavior of evangelical Christians is unexemplary.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Georgia State University]] study published in the academic journal ''Theoretical Criminology'' suggests that religion helps criminals to justify their crimes and might "encourage" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/03/08/faith_based_prison_programs_new_study_suggests_religion_may_help_criminals.html | title=New Study Suggests Religion May Help Criminals Justify Their Crimes | publisher=www.slate.com | accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research concluded that "many street offenders anticipate an early death, making them less prone to delay gratification, more likely to discount the future costs of crime, and thus more likely to offend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://tcr.sagepub.com/content/17/1/49.short?rss=1&amp;amp%3bssource=mfr | title=With God on my side: The paradoxical relationship between religious belief and criminality among hardcore street offenders |author1=Volkan Topalli |author2=Timothy Brezina |author3=Mindy Bernhardt | journal=Theoretical Criminology |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of religious values ==
Religious values can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]]. For example, [[Simon Blackburn]] states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Christianity, he states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provides examples such as the phrase in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 that has "helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America": "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live," and notes that the [[Old Testament]] God apparently has "no problems with a slave-owning society", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and "is keen on child abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn notes morally suspect themes {{which|date=February 2017}} in the Bible's New Testament as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, "The greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hume]], "The Natural History of Religion." In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said, "There are also, in most religions, specific ethical tenets which do definite harm. The Catholic condemnation of birth control, if it could prevail, would make the mitigation of poverty and the abolition of war impossible. The Hindu beliefs that the cow is a sacred animal and that it is wicked for widows to remarry cause quite needless suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that &lt;blockquote&gt;You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs....You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects |edition= |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1957 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. |location= New York |isbn=978-0-671-20323-8 |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Paul Copan, Jewish laws in the bible show an evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing forced slavery and identifying slaves as persons and not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Copan |first=Paul |url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/201102/201102_108_slavery.htm.cfm |title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery? An Overview |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bertrand Russell, "Clergymen almost necessarily fail in two ways as teachers of morals. They condemn acts which do no harm and they condone acts which do great harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites an example of a clergyman who was warned by a physician that his wife would die if she had another (her tenth) child, but impregnated her regardless, which resulted in her death. "No one condemned him; he retained his benefice and married again. So long as clergymen continue to condone cruelty and condemn 'innocent' pleasure, they can only do harm as guardians of the morals of the young."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|pages= 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell further states that, "The sense of sin which dominates many children and young people and often lasts on into later life is a misery and a source of distortion that serves no useful purpose of any sort or kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russel allows that religious sentiments have, historically, sometimes led to morally acceptable behavior, but asserts that, "in the present day, [1954] such good as might be done by imputing a theological origin to morals is inextricably bound up with such grave evils that the good becomes insignificant in comparison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are number of secular value frameworks, such as [[consequentialism]],  [[freethought]], [[humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Yet, there have been opposing views about the ability of both religious and secular moral frameworks to provide useful guides to right and wrong actions.

Various non-religious commentators have supported the ability of secular value frameworks to provide useful guides. [[Bernard Williams]] argued that, "Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate ''morality'' at all&amp;nbsp;... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Morality|authorlink1=Bernard Williams|last= Williams|first= Bernard|year= 1972|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-521-45729-7|pages= 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers criticize religious morals as incompatible with modern social norms. For example, popular atheist [[Richard Dawkins]], writing in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that we now consider morally repugnant. He has stated that [[Religious views of Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Religious aspects of Nazism|Nazis]] held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the [[Holocaust]] on account of [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitic Christian]] doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed [[Christianity and women|unfair restrictions]] on the legal and civil rights of women, and that [[Slavery and Christianity|Christians have condoned slavery]] of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The God Delusion]] |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston, New York |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |pages= 262–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Copan, the position of the Bible to slaves is a positive one for the slaves in that Jewish laws imposed a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treated slaves as persons, not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"/&gt;

A '''national church''' is a [[Christian church]] associated with a specific [[ethnic group]] or [[nation state]]. The idea was notably discussed during the [[Christianity in the 19th century|19th century]], during the emergence of modern [[nationalism]].

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in a draft discussing the question of [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] around 1828 wrote that 
:"a National Church might exist, and has existed, without [Christianity], because before the institution of the ''Christian'' Church - as [...] the Levitical Church in the Hebrew Constitution, [and] the [[Druidical]] in the Celtic, would suffice to prove".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AkiXWLPqoi8C On the Constitution of the Church and State]''. Classic Books Company; 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-7426-8368-6}}. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AkiXWLPqoi8C&amp;pg=PA59 59].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wordsworth]], Bishop of Salisbury, wrote about the National Church of Sweden in 1911, interpreting the [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of England]] as national churches of the Swedish and the English peoples, respectively. Lake (1987) traces the development of [[Presbyterianism]] in 16th-century England from the status of a "godly minority" which saw itself surrounded by the corrupt or hostile mass of the population, into a "genuine national church".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lake, [[Maria Dowling]], ''Protestantism and the national church in sixteenth century England'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1987, ISBN, 9780709916819, ch. 8 (193ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a national church remains alive in the Protestantism of England and Scandinavia in particular. While, in a context of England, the national church remains a common denominator for the Church of England, some of the Lutheran "'''folk churches'''" of Scandinavia, characterized as national churches in the ethnic sense as opposed to the idea of a state church, emerged in the second half of the 19th century following the lead of [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]].&lt;ref&gt;Dag Thorkildsen, "Scandinavia: Lutheranism and national identity" in ''World Christianities, c. 1815-1914'', vol. 8 of ''The Cambridge history of Christianity'', eds. Sheridan Gilley, Brian Stanley, Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81456-0}}, pp. 342–358.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in countries in which the state church (also known as the established church) has the following of the majority of citizens, the state church may also be the national church, and may be declared as such by the government e.g. [[Church of Denmark]],&lt;ref name="Shadid1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shadid|first=W.

This declaration implies that the Danish State does not take a neutral stand in religious matters. Nevertheless, freedom of religion has been incorporated in the Constitution. Nielsen (1992, 77) gives a short description of the position of the minority religious communities in comparison to that of the State Church: The Lutheran established church is a department of the state. Church affairs are government by a central government ministry, and clergy are government employees. The registration of births, deaths and marriages falls under this ministry of church affairs, and normally speaking the local Lutheran pastor is also the official registrar. The other small religious communities, viz. Roman Catholics, Methodists, Baptists and Jews, have the constitutional status of 'recognised communities of faith'. ... Contrary to the minority religious communities, the Lutheran Church is fully financed by the Danish State.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of Greece]],&lt;ref name="EnyediMadeley2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enyedi|first1=Zsolt|last2=Madeley|first2=John T.S.|title=Church and State in Contemporary Europe|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135761417|page=228|quote=Both as a state church and as a national church, the Orthodox Church of Greece has a lot in common with Protestant state churches, and even with Catholicism in some countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Protestantism|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816069835|page=283|quote=When Iceland obtained home rule in 1874, the new constitution, while granting religious freedom, maintained the Evangelical Lutheran Church as "a national church . . . supported by the State." This was reaffirmed in the 1944 constitution of the new independent Republic of Iceland. Democratic reforms were adopted early in the 20th century that allowed for some independent decision making in parish councils, and let congregations choose their own pastors. Under a 1998 law, the church became largely autonomous, though it is still designated established church, supported by government taxes. At the end of the 19th century, Lutherans who wanted freedom from the state church founded the Evangelical Free Church of Iceland, which now has in excess of 7,000 members. The majority of Icelanders are members of the state church. Almost all children are baptized as Lutheran and more than 90 percent are subsequently confirmed. The Church conducts 75 percent of all marriages and 99 percent of all funerals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omnipresence''' or '''ubiquity''' is the property of being present everywhere. The term omnipresence is most often used in a [[religious]] context as an attribute of a [[deity]] or [[God|supreme being]], while the term ubiquity is generally used to describe something "existing or being everywhere at the same time, constantly encountered, widespread, common." Ubiquitous can also be used as a synonym for words like worldwide, universal,  global, pervasive, all over the place. 

The omnipresence of a supreme being is conceived differently by different religious systems. In [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] beliefs like [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]] the divine and the universe are separate, but the divine is present everywhere. In [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] beliefs the divine and the universe are identical. In [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] beliefs the divine interpenetrates the universe, but extends beyond it in time and space.

==Introduction==
[[Hinduism]], and other religions that derive from it, incorporate the theory of ''transcendent and immanent omnipresence'' which is the traditional meaning of the word, [[Brahman]]. This theory defines a universal and fundamental substance, which is the source of all physical existence.

Divine omnipresence is thus one of the divine attributes, although in [[Western Christianity]] it has attracted less philosophical attention than such attributes as [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], or being eternal.

In Western theism, omnipresence is roughly described as the ability to be "present everywhere at the same time",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]: http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/omnipresent&lt;/ref&gt; referring to an unbounded or universal presence. Omnipresence means minimally that there is no place to which God’s knowledge and power do not extend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 9)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-9|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the concept of ubiquity, the ability to be everywhere or in many places at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ubiquity|title=ubiquity |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes unlimited temporal presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06612a.htm#IIB |title=Nature and Attributes of God |work= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | publisher=NewAdvent.org |date=September 1, 1909 |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Lane Craig]] states that we shouldn’t think of God as being in space in the sense of being spread out like an invisible ether throughout space. He is not like an invisible gas that is everywhere present in space. This would be incorrect for several reasons. For one, it would mean that if the universe is finite, which is perfectly possible, then God would be finite. We do not want to say that because God is infinite. More seriously, if God is spread out throughout space, like an invisible ether, that means that he is not fully present everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 8)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-8|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{Who|date=June 2010}} argue that omnipresence is a derived characteristic: an [[omniscient]] and [[omnipotent]] deity knows everything and can be and act everywhere, simultaneously. Others propound a deity as having the "Three O's", including omnipresence as a unique characteristic of the deity. Most [[Christian denominations]] — following [[theology]] standardized by the [[Nicene Creed]] — explain the concept of omnipresence in the form of the "Trinity", by having a single deity (God) made up of three omnipresent persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

&lt;!--''Comment: It is unclear as to what is meant by "Vedic religion" or labels such as "Indian Vedics." The article seems to claim omnipresence originated in South-east Asia. Possible, but highly unlikely.'' --&gt;
Several ancient cultures such as the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] and the [[Native American religion|Native American]] civilizations share similar views on omnipresent nature; the ancient [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptians]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Romans]] did not worship an omnipresent being. While most [[Paleolithic]] cultures followed [[Paleolithic religion|polytheistic practices]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, a form of omnipresent deity arises from a worldview that does not share ideas with [[mono-local deity]] cultures. Some omnipresent religions see the whole of [[existence]] as a manifestation of the deity. There are two predominant viewpoints here: [[pantheism]], deity is the summation of Existence; and panentheism, deity is an emergent property of existence. The first is closest to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]' worldview; the latter resembles the [[Vedic period|Vedic]] outlook.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In traditional Jewish monotheism belief of panentheism, or an omnipresent God, is rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saadia Gaon]] in his ''HaNivchar BaEmunot U'va-Deot'', II, 11 (English translation of portion free online at end of [https://forthodoxy.org/2015/11/23/parashat-vayetze-yaakov-hamakom-gods-place-or-the-place-of-god/ this post]; Rosenblatt translation [The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, Yale University, 1948], p. 124-125; Arabic/Hebrew Kafih ed. [הנבחר באמונות ובדעות, Jerusalem, 1970] p. 106). Cf. [[Maimonides]]' rejection of panentheism in his Commentary on the Mishnah, Tractate Sanhedrin, 10:1, third principle (English translation by Rosner in ''Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah: Tractate Sanhedrin'' [New York, 1981], p. 151; p. 141 in Kafih's Hebrew edition of the Order of Neziqin with Maimonides' Commentary [Jerusalem, 1963]) and [https://forthodoxy.org/2016/02/03/is-judaism-panentheistic-a-mekori-perspective/ Is Judaism Panentheistic? – A Brief Mekori Perspective].&lt;/ref&gt; While the "entire concept of God occupying physical space, or having any category of spatial reference apply to him was completely rejected by pure Judaic monotheism," [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] teachings, along with certain [[Kabbalistic]] systems, diverged to postulate belief in panentheism.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan, Yehudah B. [https://forthodoxy.org/2015/11/23/parashat-vayetze-yaakov-hamakom-gods-place-or-the-place-of-god/ Parashat Vayetze: HaMakom – God’s Place or the Place of God?] Retrieved 2016-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic beliefs, pantheism is also rejected and omnipresence is described to transcend the physical. According to Shia tradition in [[Nahj al-Balagha]], a compilation of [[Ali]]'s teachings and letters, with commentary by [[Morteza Motahhari]], the only territory that God does not enter is that of nothingness and non-existence. God is with everything, but not in anything, and nothing is with him. God is not within things, though not out of them. He is over and above every kind of condition, state, similarity and likeness.  [[Ali]] says about God's omnipresence: 
* "He is with everything but not in physical nearness.  He is different from everything but not in physical separation." 
* “He  is  not  inside  things  in  the  sense  of  physical  [pervasion  or] penetration  and  is  not  outside  them  in  the  sense  of  [physical]  exclusion [for exclusion entails a kind of finitude].” 
* “He is distinct from things because He overpowers them, and the things are distinct from Him because of their subjection to Him.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duas.org/pdfs/Nahjul-Balagha.pdf pg 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christianity, as well as in Kabbalistic and Hasidic philosophy, God is omnipresent. However, the major difference between them and other religious systems is that God is still [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] to His [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] and yet [[immanence|immanent]] in relating to creation. God is not immersed in the substance of creation, even though he is able to interact with it as he chooses. He cannot be excluded from any location or object in creation. God's presence is continuous throughout all of creation, though it may not be revealed in the same way at the same time to people everywhere. At times, he may be actively present in a situation, while he may not reveal that he is present in another circumstance in some other area. God is omnipresent in a way that he is able to interact with his creation however he chooses, and is the very essence of his creation. While contrary to normal physical intuitions, such omnipresence is logically possible by way of the classic geometric point or its equivalent, in that such a point is, by definition, within all of space without taking up any space. The [[Bible]] states that God can be both present to a person in a manifest manner ([[Psalm]] 46:1, [[Isaiah]] 57:15) as well as being present in every situation in all of creation at any given time (Psalm 33:13-14). Specifically, Oden states that the Bible shows that God can be present in every aspect of human life:

* God is naturally present in every aspect of the natural order, in every level of [[causality]], every fleeting [[Moment (time)|moment]] and momentous event of [[natural history]]...(Psalm 8:3, Isaiah 40:12, [[Nahum]] 1:3)
*God is bodily present in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)]] of his Son, [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] ([[Gospel of John]] 1:14, [[Colossians]] 2:9)
*God is sacredly present and becomes known in special places where God chooses to meet us, places that become set apart by the faithful remembering community ([[1 Corinthians]] 11:23-29) where it may said: "Truly the Lord is in this place" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:16, Matthew 18:20)" &lt;ref&gt;Oden, Thomas C.  ''The Living God''.  ''Systematic Theology'' Vol. 1, 67-69&lt;/ref&gt;

Marbaniang points out that omnipresence doesn't mean divine occupation of all space, nor divine distribution over all space, nor indwelling of every entity, nor that God cannot move in space, nor the divinification of the universe; but means that God is fully present every-where, and that God can do different things at different places at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "Omnipresence", &lt;i&gt;Light of Life&lt;/i&gt;, Mumbai, February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peace Mala''' ('''The Peace Mala Project for World Peace'''), is an organisation based in [[Morriston]] in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]] dedicated to fostering inter-cultural and inter-faith tolerance through the manufacture, distribution and wearing of a symbolic [[Japa mala|mala]] (bracelet) whose beads represent various faiths.

The organisation's stated aims are "promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/ From the 'Main aims of Peace Mala']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Peace Mala bracelet==
A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent Christianity, [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Folk religion|Tribal and Native Religions]], [[Jainism]], [[Earth religion]]s, [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Bön#Yungdrung Bön|Yungdrung Bön]]. The central white bead represents the wearer and whatever path they follow, with two knots on the elastic thread: one  symbolising the wearer's uniqueness, the other a reminder of [[causality]] and the path of peace and friendship to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html Official description of the symbology and representations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831214813/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html |date=31 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peace Mala was founded in 2002 by Pam Evans, former Head of the Department of Religious Studies at Coedcae Comprehensive School in [[Llanelli]], Carmarthenshire, Wales. The idea arose from class discussions about the contribution of the "[[September 11 attacks|9/11]]" attacks in New York to [[Islamophobia]], racism, religious intolerance and [[fundamentalism]] worldwide, as well as local effects exemplified by the experience of the student Imran Sheikh: "''I suffered from racist taunts and our local mosque was attacked following September 11 and that is when the Peace Mala all started.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3162388.stm Word spreads of 'peace mala'], BBC Wales interview upon winning first prize in the ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Evans gave up her position as Head of Department at Coedcae School to focus on her work with Peace Mala.  On 16 November 2006, (25th Shawwal 1427 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]), Evans was awarded the ''Noble Soul'' Award 2006 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to challenging Islamophobia in schools.  The award was presented by RAHMA (Racial Attacks and Harassment Monitoring Association) on the ''International Day of Peace.''

===Launch===
Peace Mala was officially launched in the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff|UNA Temple of Peace]] in [[Cardiff]] on Wednesday 27 November 2002 by [[Archbishop of Wales]] [[Rowan Williams]] (later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]). He was joined by members of the fourteen faiths represented on the Peace Mala bracelet, whose procession opened the ceremony, along with NGOs, students and teachers of schools from across Wales, lecturers from the University of Wales, and pupils and staff of Coedcae Comprehensive School.

===Awards===
Through the promotion of peace, tolerance and respect, Peace Mala has received numerous awards for their work, notably [[The Prince's Trust]] Millennium Award in 2003, the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] Community Dividend Award in 2003, the [[ChildLine]] Cymru CHIPS Friendship and Respect Award in 2003 (1st Prize), and the Carmarthenshire Police Community Challenge Award in 2004.  In 2004 Peace Mala was also awarded First Prize in the [[CEWC-Cymru]] "Right-On" National Competition to promote Human Rights in Welsh schools. In 2006 Peace Mala was awarded a grant by Awards for All (Wales) in support of the Peace Mala Awards for Youth.

==Charitable status==
On 21 February 2007, Peace Mala, already a [[company limited by guarantee]] and not having a share capital, was entered in the [[Central Register of Charities]] as Registered Charity No. 1118053.

==Patrons==
[[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was patron of Peace Mala from 2003 until 2008, and was succeeded by Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of the ''Yundrung Bön Study Centre''.

===Rowan Williams===
Williams and Evans first met when he visited Coedcae School to give talks to the pupils about his work as Archbishop of Wales, a position now held by [[Barry Morgan]].  Williams was one of the first persons to be contacted by Evans when she came up with the idea of the Peace Mala. One of Williams's final acts as Archbishop of Wales was to join 14 other religious dignitaries in the launch of the Peace Mala in November 2002.

In 2003 Evans invited Williams to be a patron; he held the position until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Reverend Dr Rowan Williams  Archbishop Of Canterbury|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030815001700/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|archivedate=15 August 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lama Khemsar Rinpoche===
Lama Khemsar Rinpoche also visited Coedcae School prior to his involvement with Peace Mala.  Rinpoche left [[Tibet]] in 1959, and is the first resident Lama of the Yungdrung Bön tradition in Europe. He also teaches widely in the US.

Evans invited Lama Khemsar Rinpoche to be a patron of the organisation, and he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director  Of The Tibetan Yungdrung Bon Study Centre|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195024/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Lama Khemsar Rinpoche's students have made use of the main room in the Peace Mala Registered Office for their weekly Bön [[Ngöndro|Zogchen Ngöndro]] prayers and meditations. The Tibetan room at the centre is often used by Rinpoche when he visits Wales.

==Website==
The Peace Mala website was created in 2002 using money granted by the Princes Trust Millennium Award. It was designed and published using 100% [[solar power]] by the web publishing company Arcania. The website includes news articles relating to Peace Mala activities and endorsements from prominent religious leaders, political dignitaries and celebrities including the [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama|the 14th Dalai Lama]], [[Jillian Evans]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], Sir [[Mark Tully]] [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Bonnie Tyler]] and Barbara Dickson.

==Registered office==
On Wednesday 18 August 2004, the Peace Mala Registered Office was officially opened during a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor and Consort of the City of Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Of The Registered Office For Peace Mala|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192928/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registered office is used as a base for Peace Mala activities including workshops and public talks. Yungdrung Bön practitioners in Wales also use the centre for their weekly ''Bon Zogchen Ngon-Dro'' prayers and meditations. Yungdrung Bön (meaning ''Eternal Light'' or ''Enlightened Teaching'') is the pre-Buddhist [[Bön]] faith of [[Tibet]].

===Peace Garden===
Attached to the registered office is a peace garden with many features including a shrine to [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], [[Buddharupa|Buddhist statues]] and [[prayer flags]], a miniature [[Zen]]-style stone garden, water features, and a tree area which has been blessed in a ceremony led by [[Neopaganism|Witches]], and [[Druid]]s.  There is also a tranquil area facing [[Mecca]], which is dedicated to the [[Islam|Muslim faith]].

==Aims==
Peace Mala outlined its "Main Aims" as:
*Education for global citizenship through the promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths.
*Peace Mala supports human rights, confronts bullying and all forms of prejudice.
*Peace Mala raises awareness of issues of global interdependence and encourages active compassion by learners that will effect positive changes locally and globally.

==Educational work==
Peace Mala works to engages with schools to educate youths into becoming "''global citizens through the promotion of respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities and faiths''".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Alex, "Youngsters honoured for promoting peace", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Awards for Youth===
In 2006 Peace Mala launched the ''Peace Mala Awards for Youth''.  The awards and competition encourage young people "''...  to become aware of and involved with issues of peace, justice, tolerance and friendship.''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html Peace Mala, PEACE MALA NATIONAL AWARDS FOR YOUTH  Award Winners 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420011636/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html |date=20 April 2012 }}. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; The competition focuses in issues of equality, human rights and global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positivenews.org.uk/2007/archive/1144/peace-mala-international-youth-awards/ "Peace Mala International Youth Awards"], ''Positive News'', 17 October 2007. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Youth Awards allows entrants from educational institutions, youth groups and faith groups. Two prizes are awarded: one for juniors (5–11) and the other for seniors (12–18). The awards were accompanied by cash prizes, and occasionally donated gifts such as commemorative framed posters signed by Gary Marlon Suson from the Ground Zero Museum Workshop.

In 2007 the Peace Mala Awards for Youth became an international competition with youth groups in the USA taking part in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Kay, "Peace hopes win top prize", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 27 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Awards were superseded by the Peace Mala Accreditation.

===Accreditation for Schools, Youth Groups and Community Groups===
In September 2009 Peace Mala celebrated the last Youth Awards ceremony, where the Awards were replaced an accreditation for schools, youth groups and community groups.  As the Awards had focused on competitive engagement by schools and some youth groups, the accreditation would be more cooperative and inclusive.  Schools and groups are encouraged to include the vision and objectives of Peace Mala within their ethos via the seven criteria and accreditation is awarded when the seven criteria have been successfully fulfilled as outlined in the self-assessment form available to applicants. These seven areas are intended to fit into the school, youth group or community group's values system and are in line with the objectives and vision of Peace Mala.

Applicants for accreditation are judged against seven key criteria:

# Community cohesion and global citizenship
# Needs and human rights
# Interdependence
# Active compassion
# Celebrating diversity
# Environmental responsibilities and sustainable change
# Conflict resolution and peace education

==Interfaith engagement==
Along with education and youth engagement, with the religious nature of its founding, Peace Mala engages regularly with interfaith and diversity engagement and occasions. Awareness events and fundraisers are regular occurrences.

===Pilgrimages===
Pilgrimages have been used by Peace Mala as a means of promotion, but also as a means to engage communities in interfaith involvement and raise awareness of local areas of interest and community diversity.

====Santiago de Compostela====

====Gower====
In May 2011, volunteers discovered a route map which may have been a pilgrimage path linking the Celtic churches of the [[Gower Peninsula]], as well pre-Christian sites such as holy wells and [[Dolmen|cromlech]] stones. A pilgrimage was organised, therefore, the next year to celebrate Peace Mala's first decennial year. The pilgrimage included one pilgrim who was joined at different legs of the pilgrimage culminating in a ceremony at St. Rhidian's Church in [[Llanrhidian]]. For the pilgrimage, Pam Evans travelled to Kildare to receive the flame of Brigid of the [[Brigidine Sisters]] of the Solas Bhríde hermitage; she then received the [[World Peace Flame]] at the [[Dru yoga|Dru International]] Training Centre for Education and Wellbeing in [[Snowdonia National Park]]; finally, various faith representatives attended a ceremony where a flame was blessed at the shrine of St David at [[St David's Cathedral]] by The Very Revd [[Jonathan Lean]]. These three flames were used during the start of the pilgrimage, where the lights were blessed by The Rt Revd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]]; as well as at the end, where the flames were blessed by numerous faith representatives including Muslim, Druid and Buddhists, as well as [[ISKCON]] sannyasa who greeted the pilgrims with kirtan.

At each of the sites visited, the main pilgrim lit votive candles and recited a prayer composed for the pilgrimage. She was joined on various days by school children as well as fellow pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;"Pilgrims step out on peace walk", ''[[South Wales Evening Post]]'', 26 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Llangyfelach "Forgotten" Monastery====
On Thursday 9 May 2013, Ascension Day, Peace Mala led a one-day pilgrimage as means of a revival of a postulated pilgrimage route to a now-defunct early Celtic monastery founded by St David on the site of the current parish Church of St David and St Cyfelach in [[Llangyfelach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul, "Old tradition revived by pilgrimage", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants in the pilgrimage included pupil from St John Lloyd Catholic School in Llanelli, Hafod Primary School in Swansea and Catwg Primary School. Also in procession were dignitaries from numerous faith, including The Rt Rev'd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]], as well as representatives from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University]], the [[Catholic Church]], [[Anglican Communion]] and [[Kagyu]] Tibetan Buddhism among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Pam, "Peace Mala Pilgrimage to Saint David's Forgotten Monastery", ''Diocesan News: The Diocese of Swansea &amp; Brecon '', Issue № 18, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travelling Doves of Peace====
Peace Mala released 14 small symbolic doves made from wood painted in the Peace Mala colours and each carrying a Peace Mala bracelet (along with other items) during a ceremony that took place in the Peace Mala peace garden on 30th April 2015. The Deputy Lord Mayor of the City and County of Swansea, the Mayor and Mayoress of Neath Port Talbot, Regional Chief of Police, Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia, representatives of several faith communities and pupils and teachers from some of Peace Mala Accredited schools were all in attendance.

The founder aims that as the Doves of Peace (also known as 'Peace Doves') travel the UK and across the world, they will raise awareness of the work of Peace Mala with schools, youth groups and community groups. Within the first few months after the launch, three of the doves travelled to the USA, Ireland, Holland, Italy, Cyprus, Israel, Africa, Hong Kong and Japan. The journeys of the 14 doves are being tracked to provide a geography project for schools and youth groups. This information is published on Facebook, Twitter and our interactive world maps for people to follow online.

[[File:Dove 13 in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Dove 13 in Jerusalem]]

Each dove is being sponsored on its travels, thereby also bringing financial support and security for the future work of the Peace Mala educational charity. One doves in particular, number 13, is known as the Inter-Faith Dove of Peace. Information on how to sponsor the doves is available on the Peace Mala website.

===Festival of Interfaith and Culture for Education===
The Peace Mala Festival of Inter-Faith and Culture for Education was held at the award-winning, beautifully restored setting of The Monastery Manchester in Gorton on 4 October 2010.  The festival was organised by Laura Daniels, Head Teacher of Woodheys Primary School in Sale Greater Manchester, one of the first accredited schools in the UK.  Daniels came on board as an educational ambassador for Peace Mala in 2008.

The festival brought together Peace Mala with the Greater Manchester Authorities and representatives of local Faith and Peace groups to celebrate humanity, unity and diversity.  Messages of support came from the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Archbishop of Wales and the former Bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East.  Other support was shown by organisations including One World Week, The Interfaith Foundation, Spiritual England, Trafford CYPS and Redeeming Our Communities Manchester.

Many schools, cultural communities and representatives of faith communities took part. Guest of honour and main speaker was Terry Waite CBE.

===Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales===
On 10 June 2010 the founder of Peace Mala was honoured with the Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales.  This award was first introduced by the Welsh Assembly Government in 2009. The 2010 Award for Promoting Tolerance was carefully selected to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the death camps in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Evans received this honour from the First Minister Carwyn Jones AM in recognition of her work with Peace Mala and her positive stand against all forms of inequality and intolerance.

'''Peace Mala units at Primary and Secondary level included in the new Religious Education Agreed Syllabus for Trafford Education Authority UK'''

On Wednesday 9 February 2011, the founder was invited to take part in a full day of meetings with Trafford Education Authority to discuss the inclusion of Peace Mala units at primary and secondary level for the new RE Agreed Syllabus.  This proved highly successful with ideas being shared between teachers and RE advisors including Steve Illingworth (Independent Educational Consultant and Education Link Officer to Salford SACRE) and Erica Pounce, School Improvement Partner and Link Advisor for Primary Education. Pounce reported that they had worked as a Collaborative with other Greater Manchester SACREs but had also developed a distinctive local flavour, which is where the Peace Mala Units would sit as an optional unit and as an example of a compelling learning experience.
The New RE syllabus for Trafford Education Authority, including units on Peace Mala, was launched on 24 March 2011.

===International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace, Llandaff 2017===
In July 2017 the Peace Mala International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace took place at Llandaff Cathedral Wales. This major event took almost two years to organise and plan. The idea came to the founder after the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday 13 the November 2015. The founder felt urged to bring the Peace Mala community together and Llandaff Cathedral immediately sprang to mind as a venue for this. She also felt it was time to put the spotlight on the work being achieved by the children and young people in Peace Mala schools. The purpose would be to send out a message of love, friendship and peace to all people in our world. Representatives from sixteen religions, including three Christian Bishops, and supporters from across the UK and beyond attended and took part. These included dignitaries from Cardiff, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Greater Manchester and Peace Mala schools from across Wales, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The cathedral was filled to capacity and turned out to be the largest interfaith gathering for world peace that Wales had hosted.

===Apostolic Blessing for Peace Mala from Pope Francis, September 2017===
On September 21st 2017, Peace Mala celebrated the UN International Day of Peace at St Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral in Swansea Wales UK. This was thanks to the invitation of Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia and the support of the Dean, Rev. Fr. Benedict Koledoye. Seven schools attended and took part in the Peace Mala Youth Liturgy for World Peace. Peace Mala linked up with One Day one Choir, a global peace initiative which uses the harmonious power of singing together to unite people around the world on Peace Day.

Peace Mala schools that could not be present at the event sang the Peace Mala Anthem, ‘One Light’ in their school assemblies across the UK. Lee Michael Walton, composer of the anthem, drove from London and back to accompany the children’s singing on St Joseph’s Cathedral organ. When it came to the final prayer and blessing from Bishop Tom, he susprised the congregation with an Apostolic Blessing from Pope Francis,

''"His Holiness Pope Francis presents his good wishes to Pam Evans and to all those persons involved in Peace Mala and imparts to them the requested Apostolic Blessing upon their work for world peace and encourages them with his prayers."''

This message and blessing which has a seal signed by the Apostolic Nuncio, is now on the office wall of Peace Mala HQ in Swansea.

===Youth Liturgy for World Peace, St David's Church Neath 2018===
On September 21st 2018 Peace Mala will be working with St David's Church in Neath to host a Youth Liturgy for World Peace on the UN International Day of Peace. Peace Mala accredited schools and those working towards accreditation will be joined by local dignitaries and 21 representatives from eleven different faiths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">'''Pious fraud''' is used to describe [[fraud]] in [[religion]] or medicine. A pious fraud can be counterfeiting a [[miracle]] or falsely attributing a [[Pseudepigraph|sacred text to a biblical figure]] due to the belief that the "[[Consequentialism|end justifies the means]]", in this case the end of increasing [[faith]] by whatever means available.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for definition of term|date=February 2011}}

==Use of the phrase==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' reports the phrase was first used in English in 1678. [[Edward Gibbon]] was particularly fond of the phrase, using it often in his monumental and controversial work ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' in which he criticized the likelihood of some of the [[martyr]]s and miracles of the early [[Christian]] church.

[[William W. Howells]] wrote that [[shaman]]s know that their tricks are impostures, but that all who studied them agree that they really believe in their power to deal with [[spirit]]s. According to Howells, their main purpose is an honest one and they believe that this justifies the means of hoodwinking his followers in minor technical matters.&lt;ref&gt;William Howells,  1962.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to a doctor-friend in 1805:

==Isaac Newton==
In [[Isaac Newton]]'s dissertation, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'', he blames the "Roman Church" for many abuses in the world, accusing it of "pious frauds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''priestly caste''' is a social group responsible for officiating over [[sacrifice]]s and leading [[prayer]]s or other [[religious]] functions, particularly in [[nomad]]ic and [[tribe|tribal]] societies.

In some cases, as with the [[Brahmins]] of [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] [[India]] and the [[Kohanim]] and [[Levites]] of ancient Israel, the caste was a hereditary one, with a person's position as a priest depending on his biological descent. [[Zoroastrianism]] also has a hereditary priesthood, as does [[Alevism]], [[Yezidism]] and [[Yarsanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Warwick Ball|title=Rome in the East: The Transformation of an Empire|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134823871|page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Vevaina|editor2-first=Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118786277|pages=502–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Taunton|editor1-first=Gwendolyn|title=Primordial Traditions, Volume 1|date=2014|publisher=Numen Books|isbn=9780987559845|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sufism]], the [[Spiritual director|spiritual guide]] is also often a hereditary leader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fait Muedini|title=Sponsoring Sufism: How Governments Promote "Mystical Islam" in Their Domestic and Foreign Policies|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137521071|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jocelyne Cesari |date=2014 |title=The Awakening of Muslim Democracy |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=50 |isbn=978-1-107-04418-0 |quote="Intended to undercut the political power of both the hereditary ''pir'' families (the ''sajjada-nishins'', or hereditary administrators) and the ulama ... this was a direct attack on the traditional role of the Sufi leaders ...

In the Russian [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[clergy]], over time, formed a hereditary caste of [[priests]]. Marrying outside of these priestly families was strictly forbidden; indeed, some [[bishops]] did not even tolerate their clergy marrying outside of the priestly families of their diocese.&lt;ref name="Russian Clergy"&gt;The Russian Clergy (Translated from the French of Father Gagarin, S.J.), C.

In other cases, as with the [[Druids]] of the Celtic world and the [[shamans]] of ancient [[Eurasia]]n [[nomads]], the position within the caste may have depended more upon apprenticeship; the exact nature of the "caste" in these cases is difficult to ascertain due to our lack of primary sources.{{Citation needed|reason=This is an opinion.|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="163009">Various aspects of the '''relationship between religion and science''' have been cited by modern historians of science and religion, philosophers, theologians, scientists, and others from various geographical regions and cultures. Even though the ancient and medieval worlds did not have conceptions resembling the modern understandings of "science" and "religion", certain elements of these modern ideas are found throughout history. It was in the 19th century when the phrases "religion and science" or "science and religion" first emerged in literature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; This coincided with the refining of "science", from the studies of "[[natural philosophy]]", and "[[religion]]" as distinct concepts in the last few centuries partly due to professionalization of the sciences, the Protestant Reformation, colonization, and globalization.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Before Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt; Since then, many have characterized the relationship as either conflict, harmony, complexity, or mutual independence.

Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavors that vary across cultures and have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stenmark|first1=Mikael|title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model|page=45|date=2004|publisher=W.B.

Science Before the Greeks (On changes in science here)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientific and technical innovations prior to the [[scientific revolution]] were achieved by societies organized by religious traditions. Elements of the [[scientific method]] were pioneered by ancient pagan, Islamic, and Christian scholars. [[Roger Bacon]], who is often credited with formalizing the scientific method, was a Franciscan friar.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian. [https://www.amazon.com/First-Scientist-Life-Roger-Bacon/dp/0786713585/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372950566&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Roger+Bacon "The First Scientist: A Life of Roger Bacon"]. Carroll and Graf Publishers, NY, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism has historically embraced reason and empiricism, holding that science brings legitimate, but incomplete knowledge of the world and universe. Confucian thought has held different views of science over time. Most Buddhists today view science as complementary to their beliefs. While the classification of the material world by the ancient [[Mahābhūta|Indians]] and [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|Greeks]] into [[Classical elements|air, earth, fire and water]] was more philosophical, medieval [[Science in the medieval Islamic world#Notable scientists|Middle Easterns]] used practical and experimental observation to classify materials.&lt;ref name=Jim&gt;''[[Science and Islam (documentary)|Science and Islam]]'', [[Jim Al-Khalili]]. [[BBC]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in Europe such as the [[Galileo affair]], associated with the scientific revolution and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], led scholars such as [[John William Draper]] to postulate a [[conflict thesis]], holding that religion and science have been in conflict methodologically, factually and politically throughout history. This thesis is held by some contemporary scientists such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], [[Peter Atkins]], and [[Donald Prothero]]. The conflict thesis has lost favor among most contemporary historians of science.&lt;ref name="Russel, C.A. 2002 7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Russel, C.A.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=7|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapin1996&gt;{{cite book| author = Shapin, S.| year = 1996| title = The Scientific Revolution| page = 195| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]| isbn =| quote = In the late Victorian period it was common to write about the 'warfare between science and religion' and to presume that the two bodies of culture must always have been in conflict.

H.| year = 1991| title = Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives| page= 42| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn =| quote = In its traditional forms, the conflict thesis has been largely discredited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout history, such as [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]], [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and [[Francis Collins]], have seen compatibility or independence between religion and science. Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], other scientists, and some contemporary theologians hold that religion and science are [[non-overlapping magisteria]], addressing fundamentally separate forms of knowledge and aspects of life.  Some theologians or historians of science, including [[John Lennox]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[Brian Swimme]] and [[Ken Wilber]] propose an interconnection between science and religion, while others such as [[Ian Barbour]] believe there are even parallels.

Public acceptance of [[Fact#Fact in science|scientific facts]] may be influenced by religion; many in the [[United States]] reject evolution by [[natural selection]], especially regarding human beings. Nevertheless, the American [[National Academy of Sciences]] has written that "the evidence for evolution can be fully compatible with religious faith", a view officially endorsed by many religious denominations globally.&lt;ref name=nas&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Evolution and Creationism|author=Committee on Revising Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies|year=2008|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11876.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of "science" and "religion" are a recent invention: "religion" emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation,&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Before Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan Religion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; "science" emerged in the 19th century in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=3–4|isbn=0-226-48214-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; Originally what is today known as "science" was pioneered as "natural philosophy". Furthermore, the phrase "religion and science" or "science and religion" emerged in the 19th century, not before, due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion|date=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-18448-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226317838|pages=254–255, 259, 260|chapter=10. Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 19th century that the terms "Buddhism", "Hinduism", "Taoism", "Confucianism" and "World Religions" first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ananda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephson|first1=Jason Ananda|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=1, 11–12|isbn=0-226-41234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

It was in the 19th century that the concept of "science" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-08928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[scientist]]'' was first coined by the naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] in 1834 and it was applied to those who sought knowledge and understanding of nature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word "scientist" to 1834.&lt;/ref&gt; From the ancient world, starting with Aristotle, to the 19th century, the term "[[natural philosophy]]" was the common term used to describe the practice of studying nature.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-68957-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Newton's book [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by [[Lord Kelvin]] and Peter Guthrie Tait's, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled [[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]] (1867).

It was in the 17th century that the concept of "religion" received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written.&lt;ref name="Before Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nongbri|first1=Brent|title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-15416-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; In the 19th century, [[Max Müller]] noted that what is called ancient religion today, would have been called "law" in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]].

Race, Nation, or Religion?'' ( Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sanskrit]] word "[[dharma]]", sometimes translated as "religion", also means law or duty. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]]. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between "imperial law" and universal or "Buddha law", but these later became independent sources of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshio Kuroda|Kuroda, Toshio]] and Jacqueline I.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The development of sciences (especially [[natural philosophy]])  in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], has considerable foundation in the works of the Arabs who translated [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] [[Classical antiquity|compositions.]]&lt;ref name="Grant1990"&gt;Grant, E. (1990, December 12). ''Science and Religion in the Middle Ages''. Speech presented at "Science and Religion in the Middle Ages," in Harvard University, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Aristotle]] played a major role in the institutionalization, systematization, and expansion of reason. [[Christianity]] accepted reason within the ambit of faith. In [[Christendom]], reason was considered subordinate to [[revelation]], which contained the ultimate truth and this truth could not be challenged. Even though the medieval Christian had the urge to use their reason, they had little on which to exercise it. In medieval universities, the faculty for natural philosophy and theology were separate, and discussions pertaining to theological issues were often not allowed to be undertaken by the faculty of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God and Reason in the Middle Ages|last=Grant|first=Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-511-03262-5|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

Natural philosophy, as taught in the arts faculties of the universities, was seen as an essential area of study in its own right and was considered necessary for almost every area of study. It was an independent field, separated from theology, which enjoyed a good deal of intellectual freedom as long as it was restricted to the natural world. In general, there was religious support for natural science by the late Middle Ages and a recognition that it was an important element of learning.&lt;ref name="Grant1990" /&gt;

The extent to which medieval science led directly to the new philosophy of the scientific revolution remains a subject for debate, but it certainly had a significant influence.&lt;ref name="Hall1994" /&gt;

The Middle Ages laid ground for the developments that took place in science, during the [[Renaissance]] which immediately succeeded it. With significant developments taking place in science, mathematics, medicine and philosophy, the relationship between science and religion became one of curiosity and questioning.&lt;ref name="Hall1994"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Renaissance, 1450-1630|last=Hall|first=Marie Boas|publisher=Dover publications|origyear=1962|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} As [[humanism]] became more and more popular, people tried to understand the nature around them better, rather than turn to religious aspirations. Renaissance humanism looked to classical Greek and Roman texts to change contemporary thought, allowing for a new mindset after the Middle Ages. Renaissance readers understood these [[Classics|classical texts]] as focusing on human decisions, actions and creations, rather than blindly following the rules set forth by the Catholic Church as "God's plan." Though many Renaissance humanists remained religious, they believed God gave humans opportunities and it was humanity's duty to do the "best and most moral thing". Renaissance humanism was an "ethical theory and practice that emphasized reason, scientific inquiry and human fulfillment in the natural world," said [[Susan Abernethy|Abernethy]].&lt;ref name="Szalay2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/55230-renaissance.html|title=The Renaissance: The 'Rebirth' of Science &amp; Culture|last=Szalay|first=Jessie|date=June 29, 2016&lt;!-- 11:09am ET--&gt;|website=www.livescience.com|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1630, ancient authority from classical literature and philosophy, as well as their necessity, started eroding, although scientists were still expected to be fluent in [[New Latin|Latin]], the international language of Europe's intellectuals. With the sheer success of science and the steady advance of [[rationalism]], the individual scientist gained prestige.&lt;ref name="Hall1994" /&gt;

Along with the inventions of this period, especially the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], allowed for the dissemination of the [[Bible]] in languages of the common people (languages other than Latin). This allowed more people to read and learn from the scripture, leading to the [[Evangelism|Evangelical movement]]. The people who spread this message, concentrated more on [[Individualism|individual agency]] rather than the structures of the Church.&lt;ref name="Szalay2016" /&gt;

== Perspectives ==
[[File:Dawkins aaconf.jpg|thumb|According to [[Richard Dawkins]], "Not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science. It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp. It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism?language=en Richard Dawkins on militant atheism] ([http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism/transcript?language=en transcript]), [[TED talk]], 2007 (page visited on 21 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The kinds of interactions that might arise between science and religion have been categorized by theologian, Anglican priest, and physicist [[John Polkinghorne]]: (1) conflict between the disciplines, (2) independence of the disciplines, (3) dialogue between the disciplines where they overlap and (4) integration of both into one field.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]] ''Science and Theology'' SPCK/Fortress Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8006-3153-6}} pp. 20–22, following [[Ian Barbour]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This typology is similar to ones used by theologians [[Ian Barbour]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4aUPT8fmrbYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;vq=typology&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U24Iyg68UM2bEY8idn4TyMV4ViJtw Nature, Human Nature, and God], [[Ian G.

Peacocke]] (ed), [[University of Notre Dame]] press, 1981 {{ISBN|0-268-01704-2}}, pp. xiii–xv&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incompatibility ===
According to Guillermo Paz-y-Miño-C and Avelina Espinosa, the historical conflict between evolution and religion is intrinsic to the incompatibility between [[scientific]] [[rationalism]]/[[empiricism]] and the belief in [[supernatural]] causation.&lt;ref name=IH&gt;{{cite web|title= The Incompatibility Hypothesis: Evolution versus Supernatural Causation|url=http://faculty.rwu.edu/aespinosa/aespinosa/Publications_files/Incompatibility_Hypothesis_Evolution_SpCausation_Paz-y-MinoC_Espinosa_2014.pdf|publisher=In Why Does Evolution Matter?

And it offers an educated answer: their intrinsic and opposing approaches to assess reality, i.e. science by means of testing hypotheses, falsifying and/or testing predictions and replication of experiments; religion, in contrast, via belief in supernatural causality. ''Belief'' disrupts, distorts, delays or stops ''(3Ds + S)'' the comprehension and acceptance of scientific evidence. The authors consider the 3Ds + S to be cognitive effects of illusory thinking.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Everlasting Conflict Evolution-and-science versus Religiosity|url= http://faculty.rwu.edu/aespinosa/aespinosa/Publications_files/Paz-y-Mino-C_Espinosa_Everlasting_Conflict_Evol_Sci_Rel_NOVA_2013.pdf|publisher=In Religion and Ethics, edited by Gloria Simpson and Spencer Payne, New York, NY: NOVA Publishers| author=Paz-y-Miño-C G. &amp; Espinosa  A. |date=2013|pages=73–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Jerry Coyne]], views on evolution and levels of religiosity in some countries, along with the existence of books explaining reconciliation between evolution and religion, indicate that people have trouble in believing both at the same time, thus implying incompatibility.&lt;ref name=edge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/coyne09/coyne09_index.html |title=Does The Empirical Nature Of Science Contradict The Revelatory Nature Of Faith? |author= Jerry Coyne |publisher=Edge |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[physical chemist]] [[Peter Atkins]], "whereas religion scorns the power of human comprehension, science respects it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=atkins_18_2 |title=Who Really Works Hardest to Banish Ignorance? |accessdate=22 March 2008 |author=Atkins, Peter |publisher=[[Council for Secular Humanism]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Planetary scientist]] [[Carolyn Porco]] describes a hope that "the confrontation between science and formal religion will come to an end when the role played by science in the lives of all people is the same played by religion today."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11273&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] has stated that religion is the reason "questions about [[evolution]], the age of the earth, cosmology, and human evolution nearly always cause Americans to flunk science literacy tests compared to other nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2013/09/25/losing-our-religion/|website=Skepticblog|first=Donald|last=Prothero|date=25 September 2013|title=Losing our religion|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jon Miller, who studies science literacy across nations, states that Americans in general are slightly more scientifically literate than Europeans and the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific Literacy: How Do Americans Stack Up? |website=Michigan State University |publisher=Science Daily |date=February 27, 2007 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070218134322.htm |quote="A slightly higher proportion of American adults qualify as scientifically literate than European or Japanese adults, but the truth is that no major industrial nation in the world today has a sufficient number of scientifically literate adults."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[cosmologist]] and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Lawrence Krauss]], compatibility or incompatibility is a theological concern, not a scientific concern.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt;  In [[Lisa Randall]]'s view, questions of incompatibility or otherwise are not answerable, since by accepting revelations one is abandoning rules of logic which are needed to identify if there are indeed contradictions between holding certain beliefs.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] holds that incompatibility exists because religion is not problematic to a certain point before it collapses into a number of excuses for keeping certain beliefs, in light of evolutionary implications.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt;

According to [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], the central difference between the nature of science and religion is that the claims of science rely on experimental verification, while the claims of religions rely on faith, and these are irreconcilable approaches to knowing. Because of this both are incompatible as currently practiced and the debate of compatibility or incompatibility will be eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars|author= Neil deGrasse Tyson |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson From Natural History Magazine, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and physicist [[Victor J. Stenger]]'s view is that science and religion are incompatible due to conflicts between approaches of knowing and the availability of alternative plausible natural explanations for phenomena that is usually explained in religious contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J. | authorlink=Victor_J._Stenger | title=God and the folly of faith : the incompatibility of science and religion|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=290–96 |location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=1-61614-599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sean M. Carroll]], since religion makes claims that are not compatible with science, such as supernatural events, therefore both are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean|title=Science and Religion are Not Compatible|url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2009/06/23/science-and-religion-are-not-compatible|website=Sean Carroll Blog|date=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] is openly hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise and education involving science. According to Dawkins, religion "subverts science and saps the intellect".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Bantam Press, 2006, pp. 282–86.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that when science teachers attempt to expound on evolution, there is hostility aimed towards them by parents who are skeptical because they believe it conflicts with their own religious beliefs, and that even in some textbooks have had the word 'evolution' systematically removed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]'', Free Press, 2010, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked to argue the negative effects that he believes religion has on education of science.

====Criticism====

Others such as [[Francis Collins]], [[George F. R. Ellis]],
[[Kenneth R. Miller]], [[Katharine Hayhoe]], [[George Coyne]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]] argue for compatibility since they do not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and to reflect on their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts of Statements by Scientists Who See No Conflict Between Their Faith and Science|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/StatementsScience.html|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution|date=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-093049-3|pages=284–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Giberson argues that when discussing compatibility, some scientific intellectuals often ignore the viewpoints of intellectual leaders in theology and instead argue against less informed masses, thereby, defining religion by non intellectuals and slanting the debate unjustly. He argues that leaders in science sometimes trump older scientific baggage and that leaders in theology do the same, so once theological intellectuals are taken into account, people who represent extreme positions like Ken Ham and Eugenie Scott will become irrelevant.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; Cynthia Tolman notes that religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures, but when it comes to Christian theology and ultimate truths, she notes that people often rely on scripture, tradition, reason, and experience to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tolman|first1=Cynthia|title=Methods in Religion|url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html|website=Malboro College|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html|archivedate=2015-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conflict thesis ====
{{Main|Conflict thesis}}
The [[conflict thesis]], which holds that religion and science have been in conflict continuously throughout history, was popularized in the 19th century by [[John William Draper]]'s and [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s accounts. It was in the 19th century that relationship between science and religion became an actual formal topic of discourse, while before this no one had pitted science against religion or vice versa, though occasional complex interactions had been expressed before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|page=3|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most contemporary historians of science now reject the conflict thesis in its original form and no longer support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferngren, G.B.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=x|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=... while [John] Brooke's view [of a complexity thesis rather than an historical conflict thesis] has gained widespread acceptance among professional historians of science, the traditional view remains strong elsewhere, not least in the popular mind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scientists religion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

(p. 7, followed by a list of the basic reasons why the conflict thesis is wrong).&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science, Gary Ferngren, has stated "Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization. If Galileo and the Scopes trial come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Ferngren (editor). ''Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8018-7038-0}}. (Introduction, p. ix)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (Galileo and Darwin) for a "complexity" model, because religious figures were on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved to discredit religion.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Richard H.|title=For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5566-8|pages=19–22, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An often cited example of conflict, that has been clarified by historical research in the 20th century, was the Galileo affair, whereby interpretations of the Bible were used to attack ideas by [[Copernicus]] on [[heliocentrism]]. By 1616 [[Galileo]] went to Rome to try to persuade Catholic Church authorities not to ban Copernicus' ideas. In the end, a decree of the Congregation of the Index was issued, declaring that the ideas that the Sun stood still and that the Earth moved were "false" and "altogether contrary to Holy Scripture", and suspending Copernicus's ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'' until it could be corrected. Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the center of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves. He was required to "abjure, curse and detest" those opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–93).&lt;/ref&gt; However, before all this, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in a book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism as physically proven since the scientific consensus at the time was that the evidence for heliocentrism was very weak. The Church had merely sided with the scientific consensus of the time.  Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter was fulfilled by Galileo. Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often portrayed as an unlearned fool who lacked mathematical training. Although the preface of his book claims that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name "Simplicio" in Italian also has the connotation of "simpleton".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio. Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–34)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the physical Copernican advocacy. Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Beyond War and Peace:  A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual evidences that finally proved heliocentrism came centuries after Galileo: the stellar aberration of light by James Bradley in the 18th century, the orbital motions of binary stars by William Herschel in the 19th century,  the accurate measurement of the stellar parallax in the 19th century, and Newtonian mechanics in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Biékowska|editor1-first=Barbara|title=Scientific World of Copernicus: On the Occasion of the 500th Anniversary of his Birth 1473–1973.|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9401026181|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Galileo have Proof of the Earth's Movement?|url=http://muse.tau.ac.il/museum/galileo/did_galileo.html|publisher=Tel-Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to physicist Christopher Graney, Galileo's own observations did not actually support the Copernican view, but were more consistent with Tycho Brahe's hybrid model where that Earth did not move and everything else circled around it and the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanderson|first1=Katharine|title=Galileo backed Copernicus despite data: Stars viewed through early telescopes suggested that Earth stood still|journal=Nature|date=5 March 2010|doi=10.1038/news.2010.105|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100305/full/news.2010.105.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]], still believes there is competition between science and religions and point to the origin of the universe, the nature of human beings and the possibility of miracles{{sfn|Grayling|2014|p=55|ps=:''"In fact religion and science are competitors for the truth about quite a number of things, including the origins of the universe, the nature of human beings, and the belief that the laws of nature can be locally and temporarily suspended- thus allowing for miracle"''}}

=== Independence ===

A modern view, described by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] as "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]" (NOMA), is that science and religion deal with fundamentally separate aspects of human experience and so, when each stays within its own domain, they co-exist peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould]]. ''[[Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. Ballantine Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; While Gould spoke of independence from the perspective of science, [[W. T. Stace]] viewed independence from the perspective of the [[philosophy of religion]]. Stace felt that science and religion, when each is viewed in its own domain, are both consistent and complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. T. Stace]], ''[[Time and Eternity: an Essay in the Philosophy of Religion]]'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, NJ, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA's [[National Academy of Science]] supports the view that science and religion are independent.&lt;ref name="nas.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/Compatibility.html|title=Evolution Resources: Compatibility of Science and Religion |publisher=[[National Academies of the United States]]|work= [[Science, Evolution, and Creationism]]|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Science and religion are based on different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.&lt;ref name="nas.edu" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Archbishop [[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], both science and religion represent distinct ways of approaching experience and these differences are sources of debate. He views science as [[Positive science|descriptive]] and religion as [[Normative|prescriptive]]. He stated that if science and mathematics concentrate on what the world ''ought to be'', in the way that religion does, it may lead to improperly ascribing properties to the natural world as happened among the followers of [[Pythagoras]] in the sixth century B.C.&lt;ref name=habgood&gt;''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills &amp; Brown, 1964, pp. 11, 14–16, 48–55, 68–69, 87, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, proponents of a [[science of morality|normative moral science]] take issue with the idea that science has ''no'' way of guiding "oughts". Habgood also stated that he believed that the reverse situation, where religion attempts to be descriptive, can also lead to inappropriately assigning properties to the natural world. A notable example is the now defunct belief in the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] (geocentric) planetary model that held sway until changes in scientific and religious thinking were brought about by [[Galileo]] and proponents of his views.&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt;

==== Parallels in method ====
According to [[Ian Barbour]], [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] asserted that science is made up of [[paradigms]] that arise from cultural traditions, which is similar to the secular perspective on religion.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbour|first=Ian G.|authorlink=Ian Barbour|editor=Ian G. Barbour (ed.)|title=Science and Religion: New Perspectives on the Dialogue|edition=1st|year=1968|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|location=New York, Evanston and London|pages=3–29|chapter=Science and Religion Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Polanyi]] asserted that it is merely a commitment to [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] that protects against [[subjectivity]] and has nothing at all to do with personal detachment as found in many conceptions of the scientific method. Polanyi further asserted that all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a very personal if not necessarily subjective role when doing science.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Polanyi added that the scientist often merely follows intuitions of "intellectual beauty, symmetry, and 'empirical agreement'".&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Polanyi held that science requires moral commitments similar to those found in religion.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt;

Two physicists, [[Charles A. Coulson]] and [[Harold K. Schilling]], both claimed that "the methods of science and religion have much in common."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Schilling asserted that both fields—science and religion—have "a threefold structure—of experience, theoretical interpretation, and practical application."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Coulson asserted that science, like religion, "advances by creative imagination" and not by "mere collecting of facts," while stating that religion should and does "involve critical reflection on experience not unlike that which goes on in science."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Religious language and scientific language also show parallels (cf. [[rhetoric of science]]).

Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] has argued that there is superficial conflict but deep concord between science and religion, and that there is deep conflict between science and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/entries/religion-science/ Science and Religion], by Alvin Plantinga, 2007, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga, in his book ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism'', heavily contests the linkage of naturalism with science, as conceived by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and like-minded thinkers; while Daniel Dennett thinks that Plantinga stretches science to an unacceptable extent.&lt;ref name=schuessler&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|title=Philosopher sticks up for God|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/books/alvin-plantingas-new-book-on-god-and-science.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Maarten Boudry]], in reviewing the book, has commented that he resorts to [[creationism]] and fails to "stave off the conflict between theism and evolution."&lt;ref name=boudry&gt;{{cite journal|first=Maarten|last=Boudry|authorlink=Maarten Boudry|magazine=International History, Philosophy and Science Teaching Group|date=September 2012|title=Review of Alvin Plantinga (2011), Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion and Naturalism|quote=Plantinga's effort to stave off the conflict between theism and evolution is a failure... if the bar for rational belief is lowered to mere logical possibility, and the demand for positive evidence dropped, then no holds are barred.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive scientist [[Justin L.

=== Integration ===
As a general view, this holds that while interactions are complex between influences of science, theology, politics, social, and economic concerns, the productive engagements between science and religion throughout history should be duly stressed as the norm.

Scientific and theological perspectives often coexist peacefully. Christians and some non-Christian religions have historically integrated well with scientific ideas, as in the [[ancient Egypt]]ian technological mastery applied to [[monotheistic]] ends, the flourishing of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] under [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], and the scientific advances made by [[Islam|Muslim]] scholars during the [[Ottoman empire]]. Even many 19th-century Christian communities welcomed scientists who claimed that science was not at all concerned with discovering the ultimate nature of reality.&lt;ref name="habgood" /&gt; According to [[Lawrence M. Principe]], the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Drew Professor of the Humanities, from a historical perspective this points out that much of the current-day clashes occur between limited extremists—both religious and scientistic fundamentalists—over a very few topics, and that the movement of ideas back and forth between scientific and theological thought has been more usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title = Science and Religion
 |publisher = The Teaching Company

Religions have also given key participation in development of modern [[universities]] and libraries; centers of learning &amp; scholarship were coincident with religious institutions – whether pagan, Muslim, or Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A fundamental principle of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the harmony of religion and science.  [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]] asserts that true [[science]] and true [[religion]] can never be in conflict. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, stated that religion without science is superstition and that science without religion is materialism. He also admonished that true religion must conform to the conclusions of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hatcher | first = William | title = Science and the Bahá'í Faith | journal = [[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–53 |date=September 1979 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.1979.tb00359.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |pages = 306–07 |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jbs"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mehanian | first = Courosh |author2=Friberg, Stephen R.  | year = 2003 | title = Religion and Evolution Reconciled: 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Comments on Evolution | journal = The Journal of Bahá'í studies | volume = 13 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 55–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhism ==
{{Main|Buddhism and science}}
[[Buddhism]] and science have been regarded as compatible by numerous authors.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Amos. (2005) ''Buddhism and Science: Breaking New Ground (review)'' Buddhist-Christian Studies – Volume 25, 2005, pp. 176–80&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophic and psychological teachings found in Buddhism share points in common with [[Enlightenment (philosophy)|modern Western scientific and philosophic thought]]. For example, Buddhism encourages the impartial investigation of nature (an activity referred to as ''[[Dhamma vicaya|Dhamma-Vicaya]]'' in the [[Pali Canon]])—the principal object of study being oneself.  Buddhism and science both show a strong emphasis on [[causality]]. However, Buddhism doesn't focus on [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan. (2003). ''Buddhism &amp; science: breaking new ground''. Columbia University Press, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], maintains that empirical scientific evidence supersedes the traditional teachings of [[Buddhism]] when the two are in conflict. In his book ''The Universe in a Single Atom'' he wrote,  "My confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science, so in Buddhism, understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation." and "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false," he says, "then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Jon.

Among early Christian teachers, [[Tertullian]] (c. 160–220) held a generally negative opinion of [[Greek philosophy]], while [[Origen]] (c. 185–254) regarded it much more favorably and required his students to read nearly every work available to them.&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Edward B. | contribution = Christianity, History Of Science And Religion | year = 2003 | title = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion | editor-last = Van Huyssteen | editor-first = Wentzel | volume =  | pages = 123–27 | place = | publisher = Macmillan Reference  | isbn=978-0-02-865704-2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --&gt; Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], [[beauty]] and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by [[God]], given their faith in the symbol of the [[Christian cross|Cross]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: page 68-69 --&gt;

In their views, not only did the monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but the medieval church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many [[universities]] which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries, St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church's "model theologian", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. He was not unlike other medieval theologians who sought out reason in the effort to defend his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fides et Ratio (Faith and Reason), IV |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/JP2FIDES.HTM#Ch4b |author=Pope John Paul II |date=September 1998 |accessdate=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of today's scholars, such as [[Stanley Jaki]], have claimed that Christianity with its particular [[worldview]], was a crucial factor for the emergence of modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Jaki, Stanley L. The Savior of Science, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (July 2000), {{ISBN|0-8028-4772-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

David C. Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a "caricature". According to Lindberg, while there are some portions of the classical tradition which suggest this view, these were exceptional cases. It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict, according to Lindberg.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, "The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor", in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Lindberg reports that "the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led. There was no warfare between science and the church."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Peters, Ted. "Science and Religion". ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' writes that although there is some truth in the "Galileo's condemnation" story but through exaggerations, it has now become "a modern myth perpetuated by those wishing to see warfare between science and religion who were allegedly persecuted by an atavistic and dogma-bound ecclesiastical authority".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ted Peters, Science and Religion, Encyclopedia of Religion, p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Catholic Church]]'s seeming vindication of Galileo attracted much comment in the [[Galileo affair|media]].

A degree of concord between science and religion can be seen in religious belief and empirical science. The belief that God created the world and therefore humans, can lead to the view that he arranged for humans to know the world. This is underwritten by the doctrine of [[imago dei]]. In the words of [[Thomas Aquinas]], "Since human beings are said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Con |title=Religion and Science (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period "characterized by dramatic revolutions in science" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged. As science advanced, acceptance of a literal version of the Bible became "increasingly untenable" and some in that period presented ways of interpreting scripture according to its spirit on its authority and truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlightenement|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perspectives on evolution ===
In recent history, the theory of [[evolution]] has been at the center of some controversy between Christianity and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first1=Jeffrey P. |last1=Schloss | contribution = Evolutionary theory and religious belief| editor-first1 = Philip |editor-last1 = Clayton | editor-first2 = Zachary |editor-last2= Simpson | title = The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science| pages = 187–206| publisher = Oxford University Press| place = Oxford| year = 2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Religion_and_Scie.html?id=7_Ba1sm0jP4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians who accept a literal interpretation of the [[biblical creation|biblical account of creation]] find incompatibility between [[Darwinian evolution]] and their interpretation of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Sci|title=Religion and Science|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creation science]] or [[scientific creationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA268 268–285]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of [[creationism]] that attempts to provide scientific support for the [[Genesis creation narrative]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] and attempts to disprove generally accepted [[scientific fact]]s, [[Scientific theory|theories]] and [[Paradigm|scientific paradigms]] about the geological history of the Earth, [[cosmology]] of the early universe,

Later that year, a similar law was passed in Mississippi, and likewise, Arkansas in 1927. In 1968, these "anti-monkey" laws were struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] as unconstitutional, "because they established a religious doctrine violating both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendments]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;The Origin of Rights, Roger E.

Most scientists have rejected creation science for several reasons, including that its claims do not refer to natural causes and cannot be tested. In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that creationism is [[religion]], not science, and cannot be advocated in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;The legislative history demonstrates that the term "creation science," as contemplated by the state legislature, embraces this religious teaching.&lt;/cite&gt;" [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZS.html Edwards v.

[[Theistic evolution]] attempts to reconcile Christian beliefs and science by accepting the scientific understanding of the age of the Earth and the process of evolution. It includes a range of beliefs, including views described as [[old earth creationism|evolutionary creationism]], which accepts some findings of modern science but also upholds classical religious teachings about God and creation in Christian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Francis S.|title=The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief|year=2007|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=1-4165-4274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconciliation in Britain in the early 20th century ===
In ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', historian of biology [[Peter J. Bowler]] argues that in contrast to the conflicts between science and religion in the U.S. in the 1920s (most famously the [[Scopes Trial]]), during this period Great Britain experienced a concerted effort at reconciliation, championed by intellectually conservative scientists, supported by liberal theologians but opposed by younger scientists and secularists and [[British Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative Christians]]. These attempts at reconciliation fell apart in the 1930s due to increased social tensions, moves towards [[neo-orthodox]] theology and the acceptance of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', [[Peter J. Bowler]], 2001, [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}. Front dustcover flap material&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, several [[ecumenical]] organizations promoting a harmony between science and Christianity were founded, most notably the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], [[Biologos Foundation|The Biologos Foundation]], [[Christians in Science]], [[Society of Ordained Scientists|The Society of Ordained Scientists]], and [[Veritas Forum|The Veritas Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Peterson|title=Genetic Turning Points: The Ethics of Human Genetic Intervention|year=2001|publisher=[[Wm. B.

It currently has about two thousand members, all of whom affirm the Apostles' Creed as part of joining the association, and most of whom hold Ph.D.s in the natural sciences.

Across the Atlantic, the Society of Ordained Scientists and Christians in Science are similar affiliation in Great Britain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholicism ===
{{See also|Catholic Church and evolution|Catholic Church and science}}

While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981  [[John Paul II]], then [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of a biblical world view on early modern science ===
[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42 - miniature.jpg|thumb|Medieval artistic illustration of the [[spherical Earth]] in a 13th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'' (c. 1246)]]
According to [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' from the 19th century, a biblical world view affected negatively the progress of science through time. Dickinson also argues that immediately following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] matters were even worse. The interpretations of Scripture by Luther and Calvin became as sacred to their followers as the Scripture itself. For instance, when [[Georg Calixtus]] ventured, in interpreting the Psalms, to question the accepted belief that "the waters above the heavens" were contained in a vast receptacle upheld by a solid vault, he was bitterly denounced as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson White. ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (Kindle Locations 1970–2132)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, much of the scholarship in which the conflict thesis was originally based is considered to be inaccurate. For instance, the claim that early Christians rejected scientific findings by the Greco-Romans is false, since the "handmaiden" view of secular studies was seen to shed light on theology.  This view was widely adapted throughout the early medieval period and afterwards by theologians (such as Augustine) and ultimately resulted in fostering interest in knowledge about nature through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 1: That the Rise of Christianity was Responsible for the Demise of Ancient Science|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=15–18|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the claim that people of the [[Middle Ages]] widely believed that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]] was first propagated in the same period that originated the conflict thesis&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;Jeffrey Russell. ''Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians''. Praeger Paperback; New Edition (January 30, 1997). {{ISBN|0-275-95904-X}}; {{ISBN|978-0-275-95904-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is still very common in popular culture. Modern scholars regard this claim as mistaken, as the contemporary historians of science [[David C. Lindberg]] and [[Ronald L. Numbers]] write: "there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference."&lt;ref name="flat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from [[David C.

Studies in the History of Science and Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt; From the fall of Rome to the time of Columbus, all major scholars and many vernacular writers interested in the physical shape of the earth held a spherical view with the exception of Lactantius and Cosmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cormack|first=Leslie|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 3: That Medieval Christians Taught that the Earth was Flat|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=28–34|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. Floris Cohen]] argued for a biblical Protestant, but not excluding Catholicism, influence on the early development of modern science.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wu8b2NAqnb0C ''The Scientific Revolution: A Historiographical Inquiry''], [[H. Floris Cohen]], University of Chicago Press 1994, 680 pages, {{ISBN|0-226-11280-2}}, pp. 308–21&lt;/ref&gt; He presented Dutch historian [[Reijer Hooykaas|R. Hooykaas]]' argument that a biblical world-view holds all the necessary antidotes for the hubris of Greek rationalism: a respect for manual labour, leading to more experimentation and [[empiricism]], and a supreme God that left nature open to emulation and manipulation.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; It supports the idea early modern science rose due to a combination of Greek and biblical thought.&lt;ref&gt;"Finally, and most importantly, Hooykaas does not of course claim that the Scientific Revolution was exclusively the work of Protestant scholars."  Cohen (1994) p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1994) p. 313. Hooykaas puts it more poetically: "Metaphorically speaking, whereas the bodily ingredients of science may have been Greek, its vitamins and hormones were biblical."&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford historian [[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] is another who has argued that a biblical worldview was significant for the development of modern science.  Harrison contends that Protestant approaches to the book of scripture had significant, if largely unintended, consequences for the interpretation of the book of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science'' (Cambridge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=July 2013}}  Harrison has also suggested that literal readings of the Genesis narratives of the Creation and Fall motivated and legitimated scientific activity in seventeenth-century England.  For many of its seventeenth-century practitioners, science was imagined to be a means of restoring a human dominion over nature that had been lost as a consequence of the Fall.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Fall of Man and the Foundations of Science'' (Cambridge, 2007); see also Charles Webster, ''The Great Instauration'' (London: Duckworth, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

Historian and professor of religion [[Eugene Marion Klaaren|Eugene M. Klaaren]] holds that "a belief in divine creation" was central to an emergence of science in seventeenth-century England. The philosopher [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael Foster]] has published analytical philosophy connecting Christian doctrines of creation with empiricism. Historian William B. Ashworth has argued against the historical notion of distinctive mind-sets and the idea of Catholic and Protestant sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs2edDIGCqEC|title=God and Nature|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians James R. Jacob and Margaret C. Jacob have argued for a linkage between seventeenth century [[Anglican]] intellectual transformations and influential English scientists (e.g., [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compilerpress.atfreeweb.com/Anno%20Jacob%20&amp;%20Jacob%20Anglican%20Fdn%20of%20Modern%20Science.htm The Anglican Origins of Modern Science], [[Isis (journal)|Isis]], Volume 71, Issue 2, June 1980, 251–67; this is also noted on p. 366 of ''Science and Religion'', [[John Hedley Brooke]], 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dillenberger]] and [[Christopher B. Kaiser]] have written theological surveys, which also cover additional interactions occurring in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dillenberger]], ''Protestant Thought and Natural Science'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher B. Kaiser]], ''Creation and the History of Science'' ([[Eerdmans]], 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of Religion, Richard Jones, has written a philosophical critique of the "dependency thesis" which assumes that modern science emerged from Christian sources and doctrines. Though he acknowledges that modern science emerged in a religious framework, that Christianity greatly elevated the importance of science by sanctioning and religiously legitimizing it in the medieval period, and that Christianity created a favorable social context for it to grow;  he argues that direct Christian beliefs or doctrines were not primary sources of scientific pursuits by natural philosophers, nor was Christianity, in and of itself, exclusively or directly necessary in developing or practicing modern science.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones" /&gt;

[[Oxford University]] historian and theologian [[John Hedley Brooke]] wrote that "when natural philosophers referred to ''laws'' of nature, they were not glibly choosing that metaphor. Laws were the result of legislation by an intelligent deity. Thus the philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) insisted that he was discovering the "laws that God has put into nature." Later Newton would declare that the regulation of the solar system presupposed the "counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hedley Brooke]], ''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives'', 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-23961-3}}, p. 19.  See also Peter Harrison, "Newtonian Science, Miracles, and the Laws of Nature", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 56 (1995), 531–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ronald L. Numbers]] stated that this thesis "received a boost" from mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925). Numbers has also argued, "Despite the manifest shortcomings of the claim that Christianity gave birth to science—most glaringly, it ignores or minimizes the contributions of ancient Greeks and medieval Muslims—it too, refuses to succumb to the death it deserves."&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Christianity in pulpit and pew'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, [[Ronald L. Numbers]], pp. 4, 138 n. 3 where Numbers specifically raises his concerns with regards to the works of [[Michael B. Foster]], [[Reijer Hooykaas]], [[Eugene M. Klaaren]], and [[Stanley L. Jaki]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Rodney Stark]] of [[Baylor University]], argued in contrast that "Christian theology was essential for the rise of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark]], ''For the glory of God: how monotheism led to reformations, science, witch-hunts and the end of slavery'', 2003, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-11436-6}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestantism had an important influence on science. According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a  positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Puritanism]] and [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), "Robert King Merton", in [[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], ''[[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]]''. Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0595-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century [[England]] and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory,  Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–60&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study [[God]]'s influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003 /&gt;

== Confucianism and traditional Chinese religion ==
The historical process of Confucianism has largely been antipathic towards scientific discovery. However the religio-philosophical system itself is more neutral on the subject than such an analysis might suggest. In his writings On Heaven, [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] espoused a proto-scientific world view.&lt;ref&gt;Cua, Antonio S. "The Quasi-Empirical Aspect of Hsün-tzu's Philosophy of Human Nature." PEW 28 (1978), 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the Han Synthesis the more anti-empirical [[Mencius]] was favored and combined with [[Daoist]] skepticism regarding the nature of reality. Likewise, during the Medieval period, [[Zhu Xi]] argued against technical investigation and specialization proposed by Chen Liang.&lt;ref&gt;Tillman, Hoyt Cleveland.  "Utilitarian Confucianism : Chʻen Liang'' challenge to Chu Hsi" Cambridge, Mass.: Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University: Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; After contact with the West, scholars such as [[Wang Fuzhi]] would rely on Buddhist/Daoist skepticism to denounce all science as a subjective pursuit limited by humanity's fundamental ignorance of the true nature of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Alison Harley. "Man and Nature in the Philosophical Thought of Wang Fu-Chih." Publications on Asia of the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington, no. 41. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[May Fourth Movement]], attempts to modernize Confucianism and reconcile it with scientific understanding were attempted by many scholars including [[Feng Youlan]] and [[Xiong Shili]]. Given the close relationship that Confucianism shares with Buddhism, many of the same arguments used to reconcile Buddhism with science also readily translate to Confucianism. However, modern scholars have also attempted to define the relationship between science and Confucianism on Confucianism's own terms and the results have usually led to the conclusion that Confucianism and science are fundamentally compatible.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Evelyn Tucker "Confucianism and Ecology: The Interrelation of Heaven, Earth, and Humans (Religions of the World and Ecology)" Center for the Study of World Religions (August 15, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], the dividing line between objective sciences and spiritual knowledge (''adhyatma vidya'') is a linguistic paradox.&lt;ref name="Mitcham"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|author=Carl Mitcham|publisher=Macmillan Reference|year=2005|page=917|isbn=0-02-865831-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholastic activities and ancient Indian scientific advancements were so interconnected that many [[Hindu scriptures]] are also ancient scientific manuals and vice versa. In 1835, English was made the primary language for teaching in higher education in India, exposing Hindu scholars to Western secular ideas; this started [[Hindu Renaissance|a renaissance regarding religious and philosophical thought]].&lt;ref name="David Gosling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosling|first=David L.|title=Darwin and the Hindu Tradition: "Does What Goes Around Come Around?"|journal=Zygon|year=2011|volume=46|issue=2|pages=345–69|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2010.01177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindu sages maintained that logical argument and rational proof using [[Nyaya]] is the way to obtain correct knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mitcham" /&gt; The scientific level of understanding focuses on how things work and from where they originate, while Hinduism strives to understand the ultimate purposes for the existence of living things.&lt;ref name="David Gosling" /&gt; To obtain and broaden the knowledge of the world for spiritual perfection, many refer to the Bhāgavata for guidance because it draws upon a scientific and theological dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosling|first1=David|title=Science and the Hindu Tradition: Compatibility or Conflict?|journal=Hinduism and Science: Contemporary Considerations|date=September 2012|volume=47|issue=3|pages=576–77|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=664a012b-631b-40dc-8433-ab92d3cc478f%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4204|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hinduism offers methods to correct and transform itself in course of time. For instance, Hindu views on the development of life include a range of viewpoints in regards to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. For instance, it has been suggested that Wallace-Darwininan evolutionary thought was a part of Hindu thought centuries before modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Sunil|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Volume 3)|year=1999|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=688|quote=The Hindus were Spinozaites more than two thousand years before the existence of Spinoza; and Darwinians many centuries before our time, and before any word like 'evolution' existed in any language of the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shankara and the Sāmkhya did not have a problem with the theory of evolution, but instead, argued about the existence of God and what happened after death. These two distinct groups argued among each other's philosophies because of their sacred texts, not the idea of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosling|first1=David|title=Science and the Hindu Tradition: Compatibility or Conflict?|journal=Hinduism and Science: Contemporary Considerations|date=September 2012|volume=47|issue=3|page=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the publication of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', many Hindus were eager to connect their scriptures to Darwinism, finding similarities between Brahma's creation, Vishnu's incarnations, and evolution theories.&lt;ref name="David Gosling" /&gt;

[[Samkhya]], the oldest school of [[Hindu philosophy]] prescribes a particular method to analyze knowledge. According to Samkhya, all knowledge is possible through three means of valid knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Sarma, Deepak (2011) "''Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader''" p. 167 Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Samkhya Karika'', ''śloka''4&lt;/ref&gt; –
# ''Pratyakṣa'' or ''Dṛṣṭam'' – direct sense perception,
# ''Anumāna'' – [[logic]]al [[inference]] and
# ''Śabda'' or ''Āptavacana'' – verbal testimony.

[[Nyaya]], the Hindu school of logic, accepts all these 3 means and in addition accepts one more – ''[[Upamāna]]'' (comparison).

The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary in description, but classically the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe' with the other two deities being responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/beliefs/intro_1.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics-Hinduism|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect some Hindu schools do not treat the scriptural [[Creation myth#Hindu|creation myth]] literally and often the creation stories themselves do not go into specific detail, thus leaving open the possibility of incorporating at least some theories in support of evolution.

As per [[Vedas]], another explanation for the creation is based on the [[Mahābhūta|five elements]]: earth, water, fire, air and [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].
The Hindu religion traces its beginnings to the sacred Vedas. Everything that is established in the Hindu faith such as the gods and goddesses, doctrines, chants, spiritual insights, etc. flow from the poetry of [[Vedic hymns]]. The Vedas offer an honor to the sun and moon, water and wind, and to the order in Nature that is universal.

== Islam ==
{{Main|Islam and science}}
{{See also|Science in the medieval Islamic world}}

From an Islamic standpoint, science, the study of [[nature]], is considered to be linked to the concept of ''Tawhid'' (the Oneness of God), as are all other branches of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007"&gt;Muzaffar Iqbal (2007). Science &amp; Islam. Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], nature is not seen as a separate entity, but rather as an integral part of Islam's holistic outlook on God, humanity, and the world. The Islamic view of science and nature is continuous with that of religion and God. This link implies a sacred aspect to the pursuit of scientific knowledge by Muslims, as nature itself is viewed in the Qur'an as a compilation of signs pointing to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;2. Toshihiko Izutsu (1964). God and Man in the Koran. Weltansckauung. Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt; It was with this understanding that science was studied and understood in Islamic civilizations, specifically during the eighth to sixteenth centuries, prior to the colonization of the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;3.	Situating Arabic Science: Locality versus Essence (A.I. Sabra)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Briffault]], in ''The Making of Humanity'', asserts that the very existence of science, as it is understood in the modern sense, is rooted in the scientific thought and knowledge that emerged in Islamic civilizations during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Briffault (1928).

With the decline of Islamic Civilizations in the late Middle Ages and the rise of Europe, the Islamic scientific tradition shifted into a new period. Institutions that had existed for centuries in the Muslim world looked to the new scientific institutions of European powers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This changed the practice of science in the Muslim world, as Islamic scientists had to confront the western approach to scientific learning, which was based on a different philosophy of nature.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007" /&gt; From the time of this initial upheaval of the Islamic scientific tradition to the present day, Muslim scientists and scholars have developed a spectrum of viewpoints on the place of scientific learning within the context of Islam, none of which are universally accepted or practiced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Seyyid Hossein Nasr. "Islam and Modern Science"&lt;/ref&gt; However, most maintain the view that the acquisition of knowledge and scientific pursuit in general is not in disaccord with Islamic thought and religious belief.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Ahmadiyya ===
{{Further|Ahmadiyya views on evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement emphasize that "there is no contradiction between [[Islam and science]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} For example, Ahmadi Muslims universally accept in principle the process of evolution, albeit divinely guided, and actively promote it. Over the course of several decades the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution, and frequently engages in promoting how religious scriptures, such as the Qur'an, supports the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |title=Jesus and the Indian Messiah – 13.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Holy Quran]] directs attention towards science, time and again, rather than evoking prejudice against it. The Quran has never advised against studying science, lest the reader should become a non-believer; because it has no such fear or concern. The Holy Quran is not worried that if people will learn the laws of nature its spell will break. The Quran has not prevented people from science, rather it states, "Say, 'Reflect on what is happening in the heavens and the earth.'"

== Jainism ==
{{Main|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jainism]] does not support belief in a [[creator deity]]. According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents – soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p. 190, Gāthā 10.310&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Through the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[Nastika|nastika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

== Perspectives from the scientific community ==

=== History ===
{{Further|List of Jewish scientists and philosophers|List of Christian thinkers in science|List of Muslim scientists|List of atheists (science and technology)|}}
In the 17th century, founders of the [[Royal Society]] largely held conventional and orthodox religious views, and a number of them were prominent Churchmen.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, 'Religion, the Royal Society, and the Rise of Science', ''Theology and Science'', 6 (2008), 255–71.&lt;/ref&gt;  While theological issues that had the potential to be divisive were typically excluded from formal discussions of the early Society, many of its fellows nonetheless believed that their scientific activities provided support for traditional religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sprat, ''The History of the Royal Society'' (London, 1667)&lt;/ref&gt;  Clerical involvement in the Royal Society remained high until the mid-nineteenth century, when science became more professionalised.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Turner, 'The Victorian Conflict between Science and Religion: A Professional Dimension', ''Isis'', 49 (1978) 356–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] supported the compatibility of some interpretations of religion with science. In "Science, Philosophy and Religion, A Symposium" published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York in 1941, Einstein stated:
{{quotation|Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and loftiness of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation. They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he himself. In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action: it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts. According to this interpretation the well-known conflicts between religion and science in the past must all be ascribed to a misapprehension of the situation which has been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm |title=Albert Einstein:Religion and Science |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Einstein thus expresses views of [[ethical non-naturalism]] (contrasted to [[ethical naturalism]]).

Prominent modern scientists who are [[Atheism|atheists]] include evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and Nobel Prize–winning physicist [[Steven Weinberg]]. Prominent scientists advocating religious belief include Nobel Prize–winning physicist and [[United Church of Christ]] member [[Charles Townes]], evangelical Christian and past head of the [[Human Genome Project]] [[Francis Collins]], and climatologist [[John T. Houghton]].&lt;ref name=east1997 /&gt;

=== Studies on scientists' beliefs ===

In 1916, 1,000 leading American scientists were randomly chosen from ''American Men of Science'' and 42% believed God existed, 42% disbelieved, and 17% had doubts/did not know; however when the study was replicated 80 years later using ''American Men and Women of Science'' in 1996, results were very much the same with 39% believing God exists, 45% disbelieved, and 15% had doubts/did not know.&lt;ref name="east1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E. J. 1997" /&gt; In the same 1996 survey, for scientists in the fields of biology, mathematics, and physics/astronomy, belief in a god that is "in intellectual and affective communication with humankind" was most popular among [[mathematician]]s (about 45%) and least popular among [[physicist]]s (about 22%). In total, in terms of belief toward a personal god and personal immortality, about 60% of [[United States]] scientists in these fields expressed either disbelief or agnosticism and about 40% expressed belief.&lt;ref name="Larson, E. J. 1997" /&gt; This compared with 62.9% in 1914 and 33% in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Edward J.|last2=Witham|first2=Larry|title=Leading scientists still reject God|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6691/full/394313a0.html#a1|website=Nature|accessdate=27 October 2017|pages=313–313|language=en|doi=10.1038/28478|date=23 July 1998|bibcode=1998Natur.394..313L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted between 2005 and 2007 by [[Elaine Howard Ecklund]] of [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] of 1,646 natural and social science professors at 21 US research universities found that, in terms of belief in God or a higher power, more than 60% expressed either disbelief or agnosticism and more than 30% expressed belief. More specifically, nearly 34% answered "I do not believe in God" and about 30% answered "I do not know if there is a God and there is no way to find out."&lt;ref name="Ecklund study summary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine|title=Religion and Spirituality among University Scientists|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Ecklund.pdf|publisher=Social Science Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same study, 28% said they believed in God and 8% believed in a higher power that was not God.&lt;ref name="Ecklund scientists study"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|title=Science vs. Religion : What Scientists Really Think|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-539298-2|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecklund stated that scientists were often able to consider themselves spiritual without religion or belief in god.&lt;ref name=physorgeck&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/pdf5785.pdf|publisher=Physorg.com|title=Natural scientists are less likely to believe in God than are social scientists}} "Many scientists see themselves as having a spirituality not attached to a particular religious tradition. Some scientists who don't believe in God see themselves as very spiritual people. They have a way outside of themselves that they use to understand the meaning of life."&lt;/ref&gt; Ecklund and Scheitle concluded, from their study, that the individuals from non-religious backgrounds disproportionately had self-selected into scientific professions and that the assumption that becoming a scientist necessarily leads to loss of religion is untenable since the study did not strongly support the idea that scientists had dropped religious identities due to their scientific training.&lt;ref name="ecklund sheitle Buffalo univ"&gt;{{cite web|last=Donovan|first=Patricia|title=Scientists May Not Be Very Religious, but Science May Not Be to Blame|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2007/06/8732.html|publisher=University at Buffalo New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, factors such as upbringing, age, and family size were significant influences on religious identification since those who had religious upbringing were more likely to be religious and those who had a non-religious upbringing were more likely to not be religious.&lt;ref name="Ecklund study summary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ecklund sheitle Buffalo univ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecklund Scientist Demographics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ecklund|first1=Elaine Howard|last2=Scheitle|first2=Christopher P.|title=Religion among Academic Scientists: Distinctions, Disciplines, and Demographics|journal=Social Problems|date=May 2007|volume=54|issue=2|pages=289–307|doi=10.1525/sp.2007.54.2.289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also found little difference in religiosity between social and natural scientists.&lt;ref name="Ecklund Scientist Demographics" /&gt;

Many studies have been conducted in the [[United States]] and have generally found that scientists are less likely to believe in God than are the rest of the population. Precise definitions and statistics vary, with some studies concluding that about {{frac|1|3}} of scientists in the U.S. are atheists, {{frac|1|3}} agnostic, and {{frac|1|3}} have some belief in God (although some might be [[deistic]], for example).&lt;ref name="east1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E.

In terms of perceptions, most social and natural scientists from 21 American universities did not perceive conflict between science and religion, while 37% did.

A 2009 report by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that members of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) were "much less religious than the general public," with 51% believing in some form of deity or higher power. Specifically, 33% of those polled believe in God, 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power, and 41% did not believe in either God or a higher power.&lt;ref name="American Academy"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pewforum.org/Science-and-Bioethics/Scientists-and-Belief.aspx|title =Scientists and Belief|publisher = [[Pew Research Center]]|quote=A survey of scientists who are members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press in May and June 2009, finds that members of this group are, on the whole, much less religious than the general public.1 Indeed, the survey shows that scientists are roughly half as likely as the general public to believe in God or a higher power. According to the poll, just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power.|accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48% say they have a religious affiliation, equal to the number who say they are not affiliated with any religious tradition. 17% were atheists, 11% were agnostics, 20% were nothing in particular, 8% were Jewish, 10% were Catholic, 16% were Protestant, 4% were Evangelical, 10% were other religion. The survey also found younger scientists to be "substantially more likely than their older counterparts to say they believe in God". Among the surveyed fields, chemists were the most likely to say they believe in God.&lt;ref name="people-press.org" /&gt;

Elaine Ecklund conducted a study from 2011 to 2014 involving the general US population, including rank and file scientists, in collaboration with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). The study noted that 76% of the scientists identified with a religious tradition. 85% of evangelical scientists had no doubts about the existence of God, compared to 35% of the whole scientific population. In terms of religion and science, 85% of evangelical scientists saw no conflict (73% collaboration, 12% independence), while 75% of the whole scientific population saw no conflict (40% collaboration, 35% independence).&lt;ref name="Ecklund AAAS" /&gt;

Religious beliefs of US professors were examined using a nationally representative sample of more than 1,400 professors. They found that in the social sciences: 23% did not believe in God, 16% did not know if God existed, 43% believed God existed, and 16% believed in a higher power. Out of the natural sciences: 20% did not believe in God, 33% did not know if God existed, 44% believed God existed, and 4% believed in a higher power. Overall, out of the whole study: 10% were atheists, 13% were agnostic, 19% believe in a higher power, 4% believe in God some of the time, 17% had doubts but believed in God, 35% believed in God and had no doubts.&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

Farr Curlin, a [[University of Chicago]] Instructor in Medicine and a member of the [[MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics]], noted in a study that doctors tend to be science-minded religious people. He helped author a study that "found that 76 percent of doctors believe in God and 59 percent believe in some sort of afterlife." Furthermore, "90 percent of doctors in the United States attend religious services at least occasionally, compared to 81 percent of all adults." He reasoned, "The responsibility to care for those who are suffering and the rewards of helping those in need resonate throughout most religious traditions."&lt;ref name="chronicle.uchicago.edu" /&gt;

Physicians in the United States, by contrast, are much more religious than scientists, with 76% stating a belief in God.&lt;ref name="chronicle.uchicago.edu"&gt;Easton, John.

According to the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture's report on 1,100 scientists in India: 66% are Hindu, 14% did not report a religion, 10% are atheist/no religion, 3% are Muslim, 3% are Christian, 4% are Buddhist, Sikh or other.&lt;ref name="Keysar India"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keysar|first1=Ariela|last2=Kosmin|first2=Barry|title=Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists: India 2007-2008|date=2008|publisher=Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC)|location=Trinity College|url=https://commons.trincoll.edu/worldviewsofscientists/report/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 39% have a belief in a god, 6% have belief in a god sometimes, 30% do not believe in a god but believe in a higher power, 13% do not know if there is a god, and 12% do not believe in a god.&lt;ref name="Keysar India" /&gt; 49% believe in the efficacy of prayer, 90% strongly agree or somewhat agree with approving degrees in Ayurvedic medicine. Furthermore, the term "secularism" is understood to have diverse and simultaneous meanings among Indian scientists: 93% believe it to be tolerance of religions and philosophies, 83% see it as involving separation of church and state, 53% see it as not identifying with religious traditions, 40% see it as absence of religious beliefs, and 20% see it as atheism. Accordingly, 75% of Indian scientists had a "secular" outlook in terms of being tolerant of other religions.&lt;ref name="Keysar India" /&gt;

According to the Religion Among Scientists in International Context (RASIC) study on 1,581 scientists from the United Kingdom and 1,763 scientists from India, along with 200 interviews: 65% of U.K. scientists identified as nonreligious and only 6% of Indian scientists identify as nonreligious, 12% of scientists in the U.K. attend religious services on a regular basis and 32% of scientists in India do.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCaig|first1=Amy|title=Indian scientists significantly more religious than UK scientists|url=http://news.rice.edu/2014/09/24/indian-scientists-significantly-more-religious-than-uk-scientists/|website=Rice University News|publisher=Rice University|date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the Indian scientists, 73% of scientists responded that there are basic truths in many religions, 27% said they believe in God and 38% expressed belief in a higher power of some kind.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian" /&gt; In terms of perceptions of conflict between science and religion, less than half of both U.K. scientists (38%) and Indian scientists (18%) perceived conflict between religion and science.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian" /&gt;

According to Renny Thomas' study on Indian scientists, atheistic scientists in India called themselves atheists even while accepting that their lifestyle is very much a part of tradition and religion. Thus, they differ from Western atheists in that for them following the lifestyle of a religion is not antithetical to atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Renny|title=Atheism and Unbelief among Indian Scientists: Towards an Anthropology of Atheism(s)|journal=Society and Culture in South Asia|date=27 December 2016|volume=3|issue=1|pages=45–67|doi=10.1177/2393861716674292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall summary===
{{See|Conflict thesis#Modern views}}

Over time, scientists and historians have moved away from the conflict thesis and toward compatibility theses (either the integration thesis or non-overlapping magisteria). Many experts have now adopted a "complexity thesis" that combines several other models,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard H. (2011). For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science. University Press of America. Pg. 139. {{ISBN|9780761855668}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further at the expense of the conflict thesis.

Global studies which have pooled data on religion and science from 1981–2001, have noted that countries with high religiosity also have stronger faith in science, while less religious countries have more skepticism of the impact of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=67–68|quote=Instead, as is clearly shown in Figure 3.3, societies with greater faith in science also often have ''stronger'' religious beliefs." and "Indeed, the secular postindustrial societies, exemplified by the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, prove most skeptical toward the impact of science and technology, and this is in accordance with the countries where the strongest public disquiet has been expressed about certain contemporary scientific developments such as the use of genetically modified organisms, biotechnological cloning, and nuclear power. Interestingly, again the United States displays distinctive attitudes compared with similar European nations, showing greater faith in both God and scientific progress.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is noted there as distinctive because of greater faith in both God and scientific progress. Other research cites the [[National Science Foundation]]'s finding that America has more favorable public attitudes towards science than Europe, Russia, and Japan despite differences in levels of religiosity in these cultures.&lt;ref name="global public science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keeter|first=Scott|title=The Culture of Science: How the Public Relates to Science Across the Globe|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-87369-7|author2=Smith, Gregory |author3=Masci, David |pages=336, 345–47|chapter=Religious Belief and Attitudes about Science in the United States|quote=The United States is perhaps the most religious out of the advanced industrial democracies." ; "In fact, large majorities of the traditionally religious American nevertheless hold very positive views of science and scientists. Even people who accept a strict creationist view, regarding the origins of life are mostly favorable towards science." ; "Our review of three important issues on the public policy agenda in the United States suggest that although there is a potential for broad religiously based conflict over science, the scope of this conflict is limited. Only on one issue does a significant portion of the public deny strong consensus for religious reasons: evolution. The significance of this disagreement should not be understated, but it is decidedly unrepresentative of the broader set of scientific controversies and issues. As already noted, it is difficult to find any other major policy issues on which there are strong religious objections to scientific research. Religious concerns do arise in connection with a number of areas of life sciences research, such as the effort to develop medical therapies from embryonic stem cells. But these are not rooted in disputes about the truth of scientific research, and can be found across the spectrum of religious sentiment." ; "According to the National Science Foundation, public attitudes about science are more favorable in the United States than in Europe, Russia, and Japan, despite great differences across these cultures in level of religiosity (National Science Foundation, 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted on adolescents from Christian schools in Northern Ireland, noted a positive relationship between attitudes towards Christianity and science once attitudes towards [[scientism]] and creationism were accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Leslie J.|author2=Greer, John E. |title=Shaping Adolescents' Attitudes towards Science and Religion in Northern Ireland: The role of scientism, creationism and denominational schools|journal=Research in Science &amp; Technological Education|date=1 May 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=39–53|doi=10.1080/02635140120046213|bibcode = 2001RSTEd..19...39J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on people from Sweden concludes that though the Swedes are among the most non-religious, paranormal beliefs are prevalent among both the young and adult populations. This is likely due to a loss of confidence in institutions such as the Church and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sjodin|first1=Ulf|title=The Swedes and the Paranormal|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|date=2002|volume=17|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning specific topics like creationism, it is not an exclusively American phenomenon. A poll on adult Europeans revealed that 40% believed in naturalistic evolution, 21% in theistic evolution, 20% in special creation, and 19% are undecided; with the highest concentrations of young earth creationists in Switzerland (21%), Austria (20%), Germany (18%).&lt;ref name="Numbers Internat.

Creationism" /&gt;

According to a 2015 Pew Research Center Study on the public perceptions on science, people's perceptions on conflict with science have more to do with their perceptions of other people's beliefs than their own personal beliefs. For instance, the majority of people with a religious affiliation (68%) saw no conflict between their own personal religious beliefs and science while the majority of those without a religious affiliation (76%) perceived science and religion to be in conflict.&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Cary|last2=Alper|first2=Becka|title=Religion and Science: Highly Religious Americans are less likely than others to see Conflict between Faith and Science.|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/22/science-and-religion/|website=Pew Research Center|publisher=Pew|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that people who are not affiliated with any religion, also known as "religiously unaffiliated", often have supernatural beliefs and spiritual practices despite them not being affiliated with any religion&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also that "just one-in-six religiously unaffiliated adults (16%) say their own religious beliefs conflict with science."&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt; Furthermore, the study observed, "The share of all adults who perceive a conflict between science and their own religious beliefs has declined somewhat in recent years, from 36% in 2009 to 30% in 2014. Among those who are affiliated with a religion, the share of people who say there is a conflict between science and their personal religious beliefs dropped from 41% to 34% during this period."&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt;

The 2013 MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins examined the views of religious people in America on origins science topics like evolution, the Big Bang, and perceptions of conflicts between science and religion. It found that a large majority of religious people see no conflict between science and religion and only 11% of religious people belong to religions openly rejecting evolution. The fact that the gap between personal and official beliefs of their religions is so large suggests that part of the problem, might be defused by people learning more about their own religious doctrine and the science it endorses, thereby bridging this belief gap. The study concluded that "mainstream religion and mainstream science are neither attacking one another nor perceiving a conflict." Furthermore, they note that this conciliatory view is shared by most leading science organizations such as the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).&lt;ref name="MIT Science religion origins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|last2=Lee|first2=Eugena|title=The MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins: the Belief Gap|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/survey.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study collecting data from 2011 to 2014 on the general public, with focus on evangelicals and evangelical scientists was done in collaboration with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). Even though evangelicals only make up 26% of the US population, the found that nearly 70 percent of all evangelical Christians do not view science and religion as being in conflict with each other (48% saw them as complementary and 21% saw them as independent) while 73% of the general US population saw no conflict as well.&lt;ref name="Ecklund AAAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ecklund|first1=Elaine|title=Religious Communities, Science, Scientists, and Perceptions: A Comprehensive Survey|url=http://elainehowardecklund.blogs.rice.edu/files/2014/02/RU_AAASPresentationNotes_2014_0220.pdf|website=Elaine Ecklund Blog|publisher=Rice University|date=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCaig AAAS Study"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCaig|first1=Amy|title=Nearly 70 percent of evengelicals do not view religion and science as being in conflict|url=http://news.rice.edu/2015/03/13/nearly-70-percent-of-evangelicals-do-not-view-religion-and-science-as-being-in-conflict/|website=Unconventional Wisdom|publisher=Rice University|date=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other lines of research on perceptions of science among the American public conclude that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science and they have no differences with nonreligious groups in the propensity of seeking out scientific knowledge, although there may be subtle epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets.&lt;ref name="epistemic moral conflict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=John|title=Epistemological and Moral Conflict Between Religion and Science|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=2011|volume=50|issue=4|pages=707–27|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Joseph O.|journal=Public Understanding of Science|title=Public Perceptions of Incompatibility Between "Science and Religion"|year=2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=340–53|doi=10.1177/0963662511434908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from the Pew Center note similar findings and also note that the majority of Americans (80–90%) show strong support for scientific research, agree that science makes society and individual's lives better, and 8 in 10 Americans would be happy if their children were to become scientists.&lt;ref name="Pew Public Understanding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Belief and Public Attitudes About Science in the US|url=http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|publisher=Pew Research Center|author1=Scott Keeter|author2=Gregory Smith|author3=David Masci|pages=1–2, 13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619225841/http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|archivedate=2012-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science.&lt;ref name="global public science" /&gt;

According to a 2007 poll by the [[Pew Forum]], "while large majorities of Americans respect science and scientists, they are not always willing to accept scientific findings that squarely contradict their religious beliefs."&lt;ref name=pew2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=275|title=Science in America: Religious Belief and Public Attitudes|publisher=The Pew Forum|date=18 December 2007|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Forum states that specific factual disagreements are "not common today", though 40% to 50% of Americans do not accept the evolution of humans and other living things, with the "strongest opposition" coming from evangelical Christians at 65% saying life did not evolve.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; 51% of the population believes humans and other living things evolved: 26% through natural selection only, 21% somehow guided, 4% don't know.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; In the U.S., biological evolution is the only concrete example of conflict where a significant portion of the American public denies scientific consensus for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="global public science" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; In terms of advanced industrialized nations, the United States is the most religious.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt;

A 2009 study from the Pew Research Center on Americans perceptions of science, showed a broad consensus that most Americans, including most religious Americans, hold scientific research and scientists themselves in high regard. The study showed that 84% of Americans say they view science as having a mostly positive impact on society. Among those who attend religious services at least once a week, the number is roughly the same at 80%. Furthermore, 70% of U.S. adults think scientists contribute "a lot" to society.&lt;ref name="pew 2009 bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion on Religion and Science in the United States|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/public-opinion-on-religion-and-science-in-the-united-states/|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study on a national sample of US college students examined whether these students viewed the science / religion relationship as reflecting primarily conflict, collaboration, or independence. The study concluded that the majority of undergraduates in both the natural and social sciences do not see conflict between science and religion. Another finding in the study was that it is more likely for students to move away from a conflict perspective to an independence or collaboration perspective than towards a conflict view.&lt;ref name=scheitle11&gt;{{cite journal

==Concept and etymology==
{{See also|Religio}}
''Religion'' (from O.Fr. ''religion'' religious community, from L. ''religionem'' (nom. ''religio'') "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods, sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "obligation, the bond between man and the gods"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) is derived from the Latin ''[[Religio|religiō]]'', the ultimate origins of which are obscure. One possible interpretation traced to [[Cicero]], connects ''{{lang|la|lego}}'' read, i.e. ''re'' (again) with ''lego'' in the sense of choose, go over again or consider carefully. The definition of ''religio'' by [[Cicero]] is ''cultum deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' II, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar used ''religio'' to mean "obligation of an oath" when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caesar |first1=Julius |last2=Translated by |first2=W.A. McDevitte and W.S. Bohn |title=The Works of Julius Caesar: Parallel English and Latin |date=2007 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=9781605063553 |pages=377–378 |chapter=Civil Wars – Book 1|quote= Sic terror oblatus a ducibus, crudelitas in supplicio, nova religio iurisiurandi spem praesentis deditionis sustulit mentesque militum convertit et rem ad pristinam belli rationem redegit." – (Latin); "Thus the terror raised by the generals, the cruelty and punishments, the new obligation of an oath, removed all hopes of surrender for the present, changed the soldiers' minds, and reduced matters to the former state of war."- (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder, used the term ''religio'' on elephants in that they venerate the sun and the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D1 |publisher=Perseus – Tufts University |language=Book 8 Chapter 1|quote= maximum est elephans proximumque humanis sensibus, quippe intellectus illis sermonis patrii et imperiorum obedientia, officiorum quae didicere memoria, amoris et gloriae voluptas, immo vero, quae etiam in homine rara, probitas, prudentia, aequitas, religio quoque siderum solisque ac lunae veneratio." – (Latin); "The elephant is the largest of them all, and in intelligence approaches the nearest to man. It understands the language of its country, it obeys commands, and it remembers all the duties which it has been taught. It is sensible alike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degree that is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty, prudence, and equity; it has a religious respect also for the stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon." – (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars such as [[Tom Harpur]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] favor the derivation from ''{{lang|la|ligare}}'' bind, connect, probably from a prefixed ''{{lang|la|re-ligare}}'', i.e. ''re'' (again) + ''ligare'' or to reconnect, which was made prominent by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the interpretation given by [[Lactantius]] in ''Divinae institutiones'', IV, 28.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light.'' Toronto. Thomas Allen, 2004. {{ISBN|0-88762-145-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Power of Myth]],'' with Bill Moyers, ed. Betty Sue Flowers, New York, Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|0-385-41886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval usage alternates with ''order'' in designating bonded communities like those of [[monastic orders]]: "we hear of the 'religion' of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], of a knight 'of the [[Order of Aviz|religion of Avys]]'".&lt;ref name="Huizinga Middle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huizinga |first1=Johan |title=The Waning of the Middle Ages |date=1924 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=86|title-link=The Autumn of the Middle Ages }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root ''religio'' was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts; never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature: From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=254|chapter=10. Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, ''religio'' referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family, neighbors, rulers, and even towards God.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; ''Religio'' was most often used by the ancient Romans not in the context of a relation towards gods, but as a range of general emotions such as hesitation, caution, anxiety, fear; feelings of being bound, restricted, inhibited; which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context.&lt;ref name="religio roman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=1. 'Religio' without “Religion” |pages=15–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also closely related to other terms like ''scrupulus'' which meant "very precisely" and some Roman authors related the term ''supertitio'', which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame, to ''religio'' at times.&lt;ref name="religio roman" /&gt; When ''religio'' came into English around the 1200s as religion, it took the meaning of "life bound by monastic vows" or monastic orders.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizinga Middle" /&gt; The compartmentalized concept of religion, where religious things were separated from worldly things, was not used before the 1500s.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; The concept of religion was first used in the 1500s to distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities.&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17|chapter=Myth 1: All Societies Have Religions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Greece, the Greek term ''threskeia'' was loosely translated into Latin as ''religio'' in late antiquity. The term was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the first century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others; to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word ''deisidaimonia'' which meant too much fear.&lt;ref name="threskeia greece"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=8. Imagine No 'Threskeia': The Task of the Untranslator  |pages=123–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern concept of religion, as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines, is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226184487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521892933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt;
Some argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Daniel|last1=Dubuisson|title=The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-0801887567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt; Others argue that using religion on non-western cultures distorts what people do and believe.&lt;ref name="Smith Meaning and End"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Wilfred Cantwell |title=The Meaning and End of Religion|date=1991|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0800624750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of religion was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries,&lt;ref name=Nongbri1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|page=152 |quote=Although the Greeks, Romans, Mesopotamians, and many other peoples have long histories, the stories of their respective religions are of recent pedigree.

Race, Nation, or Religion?'' (Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;  One of its central concepts is ''[[halakha]]'', meaning the walk or path sometimes translated as law, which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life.&lt;ref name="WhitefordII2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whiteford |first1=Linda M. |last2=Trotter II |first2=Robert T. |title=Ethics for Anthropological Research and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeokAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |year=2008 |publisher=Waveland Press |isbn=978-1-4786-1059-5 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the beliefs and traditions of Judaism are found in the ancient world, ancient Jews saw Jewish identity as being about an ethnic or national identity and did not entail a compulsory belief system or regulated rituals.&lt;ref name="Burns Jewish"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Joshua Ezra|editor1-last=Omar|editor1-first=Irfan|editor2-last=Duffey|editor2-first=Michael|title=Peacemaking and the Challenge of Violence in World Religions|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118953426|chapter=3. Jewish ideologies of Peace and Peacemaking|pages=86-87|quote=Yet despite its ingrained theological tradition, one must acknowledge that the Jewish people did not begin to think of Judaism as a religion until fairly recently. To be clear, the contemporary religious category popularly known as Judaism can be traced back to an ancient Jewish culture traditionally entailing certain fixed ideas about God. That culture also involved unique rites and behaviors related to the worship of God later to be construed as key elements of the Jewish faith. But these cultural effects did not constitute a religion in the formal sense of the word (Nongbri 2013, 46-50). They entailed no compulsory system of belief or regulatory ritual program by which to measure one's Jewish identity. To be a Jew was primarily a matter of national or ethnic identification, a function of being born into a family of Jewish descent or choosing to disavow one's own ancestral culture to become a Jew. By and large, it was not a matter of confession or creed (Satlow 2006, 1-19). It was not until the nineteenth century that Jewish thinkers began to conceive of their ancestral culture in systematized religious terms. Seeking entry into a European civil society dominated by Christian values, many Jews touched by the liberal values of the European Enlightenment undertook to interpret their Judaism in terms analogous to Christianity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term ''ioudaismos'', which some translate as Judaism today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; It was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Burns Jewish" /&gt; The Greek word ''threskeia'', which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the New Testament. ''Threskeia'' is sometimes translated as religion in today's translations, however, the term was understood as worship well into the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300154160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran, the Arabic word ''[[Din (Arabic)|din]]'' is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed ''din'' as law.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; 

The [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as religion, also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]].

Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and [[world religions]] first entered the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015|page=101 |quote=The first recorded use of "Boudhism" was 1801, followed by "Hindooism" (1829), "Taouism" (1838), and "Confucianism" (1862) (see figure 6).

This construction of "religions" was not merely the production of European translation terms, but the reification of systems of thought in a way strikingly divorced from their original cultural milieu. The original discovery of religions in different cultures was rooted in the assumption that each people had its own divine "revelation," or at least its own parallel to Christianity. In the same period, however, European and American explorers often suggested that specific African or Native American tribes lacked religion altogether.

But these diverse identities were united, each an integral part of life; no part existed in a separate sphere identified as "religious." Nor were the diverse traditions lumped together under the term "Hinduism" unified by sharing such common features of religion as a single founder, creed, theology, or institutional organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hindu" has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=brian111&gt;{{citation|last=Pennington|first=Brian K.|title=Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7drluePK-acC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803729-3|pages=111–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|title=Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFKBAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42935-6|pages=10–11}}, Quote: "It is often said that Hinduism is very ancient, and in a sense this is true (...). It was formed by adding the English suffix -ism, of Greek origin, to the word ''Hindu'', of Persian origin; it was about the same time that the word ''Hindu'', without the suffix -ism, came to be used mainly as a religious term. (...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...) They referred to the non-Muslim majority, together with their culture, as 'Hindu'. (...) Since the people called Hindu differed from Muslims most notably in religion, the word came to have religious implications, and to denote a group of people who were identifiable by their Hindu religion.

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]] (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean diligence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]].

===Modern western===

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A.M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017| citeseerx=10.1.1.613.6995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference US]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010" /&gt;

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0034412504007462|title='Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited|journal=Religious Studies|volume=41|pages=81–94|year=2005|last1=Finlay|first1=Hueston E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"/&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Aspects==

===Beliefs===
{{Main|Religious beliefs}}
Traditionally, [[faith]], in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

====Mythology====
{{Main|Mythology}}
The word ''myth'' has several meanings.
# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 {{ISBN|0-385-24774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called myths in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library {{ISBN|1-57731-202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/myth|title=myth|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[resurrection]] of their real-life founder [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

====Worldview====
Religions have [[sacred history|sacred histories]], [[narrative]]s, and  [[mythology|mythologies]] which may be preserved in sacred [[Religious text|scriptures]], and [[Religious symbol|symbols]] and [[holy places]], that aim to explain the [[meaning of life]], the [[creation myth|origin of life]], or the [[religious cosmology|Universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Practices===
{{Main|Religious behaviour|Cult (religious practice)}}
The practices of a religion may include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration (of a [[deity]], [[God (male deity)|gods]], or [[goddess]]es), [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]]s, [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[religious music]], [[religious art]], [[sacred dance]], [[Community service|public service]], or other aspects of human culture.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social organisation===
Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized [[clergy]], and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.

==Academic study==
{{Main|Religious studies|Classifications of religious movements}}
A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: [[theology]], [[comparative religion]], [[history of religion]], [[evolutionary origin of religions]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[psychology of religion]] (including [[neurotheology|neuroscience of religion]] and [[evolutionary psychology of religion]]), [[law and religion]], and [[sociology of religion]].

Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: [[animism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], by [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[J.G. Frazer]]; the [[Psychoanalysis|psycho-analytic]] approach of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and further [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], and [[Clifford Geertz]].{{sfn|Pals|2006}}

[[Michael Stausberg]] gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including [[Cognitive science of religion|cognitive]] and biological approaches.{{sfn|Stausberg|2009}}

===Theories===
{{Main|Theories of religion}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] theories of religion generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

====Origins and development====
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Yazılıkaya]] sanctuary in [[Turkey]], with the twelve gods of the underworld]]
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.

According to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Cultural system====
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category".&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Niebuhr's (1894–1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Niebuhr, ''Christ and Culture'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1951) as cited by Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social constructionism====
{{Main|Theories about religions#Social constructionism|l1=Social constructionism}}
One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.&lt;ref name="vergote 89"&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald,  Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

====Cognitive science====
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion}}

Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[neurobiology]], [[zoology]], and [[ethology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

Hallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with [[schizophrenia]]. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomenon and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=PT|title=Psychosis and paroxysmal visions in the lives of the founders of world religions.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=26|issue=1|date=2014|pages=E13–14|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12120412|pmid=24515692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=ED|last2=Cunningham|first2=MG|last3=Price|first3=BH|title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=24|issue=4|date=2012|pages=410–426|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214|pmid=23224447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=SR|last2=Pargament|first2=KI|title=The role of religion and spirituality in mental health.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=September 2014|volume=27|issue=5|pages=358–363|doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080|pmid=25046080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reina|first1=Aaron|title=Faith Within Atheism|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=July 2014|volume=40|issue=4|pages=719–720|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt076|pmid=23760918|pmc=4059423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious content is also common in [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favazza|first1=A|editor1-last=Sadock|editor1-first=B|editor2-last=Sadock|editor2-first=V|editor3-last=Ruiz|editor3-first=P|title=Kaplan and Sadocks Comprehensive Texbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|edition=10th|chapter=Psychiatry and Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschuler|first1=EL|title=Temporal lobe epilepsy in the preistly source of the Pentateuch|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=2004|volume=11|issue=94|page=870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparativism===
{{Main|Comparative religion}}
Comparative religion is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main||History of religions}}
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of [[List of religious populations|major denominations and religions of the world]]]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:
# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], [[international]] religions
# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed religions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-516655-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. McCutcheon. ''Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lash. ''The beginning and the end of 'religion'.'' Cambridge University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-521-56635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bulbulia. "Are There Any Religions? An Evolutionary Explanation." ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.2 (2005), pp. 71–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological classification===
Some scholars classify religions as either ''[[Universalizing religion|universal religions]]'' that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ''[[ethnic religion]]s'' that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33311-5 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald. ''The Ideology of Religious Studies''. New York: Oxford University Press US, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Prentiss. ''Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity''. New York: NYU Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8147-6701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomoko Masuzawa.

===Demographical classification===
{{Main|Major religious groups|List of religious populations}}
The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of [[syncretism]]) and traditional folk religion.

A global poll in 2012 surveyed 57 countries and reported that 59% of the world's population identified as religious, 23% as [[irreligion|not religious]], 13% as convinced [[atheism|atheists]], and also a 9% decrease in identification as religious when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries.&lt;ref name="gia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf |title= Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism |publisher= WIN-Gallup International |date= 27 July 2012 |accessdate= 24 August 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120906165952/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf |archivedate= 6 September 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up poll in 2015 found that 63% of the globe identified as religious, 22% as not religious, and 11% as convinced atheists.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

==Specific religions==
{{Mainarticle|List of religions and spiritual traditions}}

===Abrahamic===
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|upright|thumb|The patriarch [[Abraham]] (by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]])]]
[[Abrahamic religions]] are [[monotheistic]] religions which believe they descend from [[Abraham]].

====Judaism====
[[File:Open Torah and pointer.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Torah]] is the primary sacred text of Judaism.]]
[[Judaism]] is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel and Judea]]. The [[Torah]] is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]]. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]]; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The [[Jewish people]] were scattered after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cbs.gov.il |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

====Christianity====
[[File:StJohnsAshfield StainedGlass GoodShepherd Portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity.]]
[[Christianity]] is based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (1st century) as presented in the [[New Testament]]. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the [[Christ]], the [[Son of God]], and as [[Messiah|Savior]] and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the [[Trinity]], which teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] (Jesus Christ), and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]]. Most Christians can describe their faith with the [[Nicene Creed]]. As the religion of [[Byzantine Empire]] in the first millennium and of [[Western Europe]] during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
* The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Bishop of Rome]] and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of 24 Churches ''[[sui iuris]]'', including the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]], such as the [[Maronite]] Catholic Church.
* [[Eastern Christianity]], which include [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]].
* [[Protestantism]], separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] and is split into thousands of [[Religious denomination|denominations]].  Major branches of Protestantism include [[Anglicanism]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Methodism]], though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.

There are also smaller groups, including:
* [[Restorationism]], the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic early church]].
* [[Latter Day Saint movement]], founded by [[Joseph Smith]] in the late 1820s.
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]].

====Islam====
[[File:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Muslim]]s [[Tawaf|circumambulating]] the [[Kaaba]], the most sacred site in [[Islam]]]]
[[Islam]] is based on the [[Quran]], one of the [[Islamic holy books|holy books]] considered by Muslims to be [[Wahy|revealed]] by [[God in Islam|God]], and on the [[Hadith|teachings (hadith)]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before [[Muhammad]]. It is the most widely practiced religion of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of [[South Asia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Europe]]. There are also several [[Islamic republic]]s, including [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Afghanistan]].
* [[Sunni Islam]] is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Quran, the hadiths which record the [[sunnah]], whilst placing emphasis on the [[sahabah]].
* [[Shia Islam]] is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that [[Ali]] succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.
* [[Ahmadiyya]] adherents believe that the awaited Imam [[Mahdi]] and the Promised Messiah has arrived, believed to be [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] by Ahmadis.
* There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].

Other denominations of Islam include [[Nation of Islam]], [[Ibadi]], [[Sufism]], [[Quranism]], [[Mahdavia]], and [[non-denominational Muslims]]. [[Wahhabism]] is the dominant Muslim [[Maddhab|schools of thought]] in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].

====Other====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th-century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. One of its divisions is the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]].

Smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including [[Samaritanism]] (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the [[Rastafari movement]] (primarily in Jamaica), and [[Druze]] (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

===East Asian===
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Dō (in Japanese or Korean). They include:

====Taoism and Confucianism====
* [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.

====Chinese folk religion====
* [[Chinese folk religion]]: the indigenous religions of the [[Han Chinese]], or, by [[metonymy]], of all the populations of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. It includes the syncretism of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Wuism]], as well as many new religious movements such as [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]], [[Falun Gong]] and [[Yiguandao]].
* Other folk and new religions of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] such as [[Korean shamanism]], [[Chondogyo]], and [[Jeung San Do]] in Korea; [[Shinto]], [[Shugendo]], [[Ryukyuan religion]], and [[Japanese new religions]] in Japan; [[Satsana Phi]] in Laos; [[Cao Đài]], [[Hòa Hảo]], and [[Vietnamese folk religion]] in Vietnam.

===Dharmic (Indian)===
[[File:Rama, Lakshman and Sita at the Kalaram Temple, Nashik..jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hindu]] statue of [[Lord Rama]] in Kalaram Temple ([[India]])]]
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Buddha]], in a [[Sanskrit]] manuscript, [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], Bihar, India]]
[[Indian religions]] are practiced or were founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They are sometimes classified as the ''dharmic religions'', as they all feature [[dharma]], the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mittal |first=Sushil |title=Surprising Bedfellows: Hindus and Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern India |year=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739106730 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
* [[Hinduism]] is preferentially self-designated by the term ''Vaidika Dharma''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC|date=2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3| page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[synecdoche]] describing the similar philosophies of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Hindu denominations|related groups]] practiced or founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Concepts most of them share in common include [[karma]], [[caste]], [[reincarnation]], [[mantra]]s, [[yantra]]s, and [[darśana]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hinduism is variously defined as a religion, set of religious beliefs and practices, religious tradition etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: "Establishing the boundaries" in Gavin Flood (2003), pp. 1–17. [[René Guénon]] in his'' [[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' (1921 ed.), Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|0-900588-74-8}}, proposes a definition of the term religion and a discussion of its relevance (or lack of) to Hindu doctrines (part II, chapter 4, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religions,&lt;ref&gt;p. 434 ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' By Wendy Doniger, M. Webster, Merriam-Webster, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 219 ''Faith, Religion &amp; Theology'' By Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges&lt;/ref&gt; with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 ''The World's Great Religions'' By Yoshiaki Gurney Omura, Selwyn Gurney Champion, Dorothy Short&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as [[Sanātana Dharma]], which is the name by which Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.

====Jainism====
* [[Jainism]], taught primarily by [[Rishabhanatha]] (the founder of [[ahimsa]]) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of [[non-violence]], [[truth]] and [[anekantavada]] for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the [[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]], and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving ([[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]]). Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the [[Mahavira]] as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}
** [[Digambara]] Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are [[Pravachanasara]] and [[Samayasara]] written by their Prophets  [[Kundakunda]] and [[Amritchandra]] as their [[Jain Agamas (Digambara)|original cannon]] is lost.
** [[Shwetambara]] Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are [[Jain Agamas]], written by their Prophet [[Sthulibhadra]].

====Buddhism====
* [[Buddhism]] was founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end their [[dukkha|suffering (dukkha)]] by understanding the [[dharma|true nature of phenomena]], thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].
** [[Theravada]] Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the [[Pali Canon]].
** [[Mahayana]] Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent [[Buddhism in China|in China]] and are still relevant [[Buddhism in Vietnam|in Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and to a lesser extent [[Buddhism in the West|in Europe and the United States]]. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as [[Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], and [[Soka Gakkai]].
** [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony (2000), Buddhist Thought: A complete introduction to the Indian tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-18593-5}} p=194&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E.

The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in ''[[Waheguru]]''—represented by the phrase ''[[ik Onkar|ik ōaṅkār]]'', meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

===Indigenous and folk===
[[File:Chinese temple incence burner.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Incense]] burner in China]]

[[Iranian religions]] are ancient religions whose roots predate the [[Islamization]] of [[Greater Iran]]. Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.

[[Zoroastrianism]] is based on the teachings of prophet [[Zoroaster]] in the 6th century BCE. Zoroastrians worship the [[Creator deity|creator]] [[Ahura Mazda]]. In Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda, and good trying to sustain it.

[[Mandaeism]] is a [[monotheistic]] religion with a strongly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview. Mandaeans are sometime labeled as the Last [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]].

===New religious movements===
{{Main|New religious movement}}
*  [[Japanese new religions|Shinshūkyō]] is a general category for a wide variety of religious movements founded in Japan since the 19th century. These movements share almost nothing in common except the place of their founding. The largest religious movements centered in Japan include [[Soka Gakkai]], [[Tenrikyo]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]] among hundreds of smaller groups.
* [[Cao Đài]] is a syncretistic, monotheistic religion, established in [[Vietnam]] in 1926.

* [[Unitarian Universalism]] is a religion characterized by support for a free and responsible search for truth and meaning, and has no accepted [[creed]] or [[theology]].
* [[Noahidism]] is a monotheistic ideology based on the Seven Laws of Noah, and on their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism.
* [[Scientology]] teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counseling known as [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]], in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience and understand painful or traumatic events and decisions in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects.
* [[Eckankar]] is a pantheistic religion with the purpose of making God an everyday reality in one's life.
* [[Wicca]] is a neo-pagan religion first popularised in 1954 by British civil servant [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], involving the worship of a God and Goddess.
* [[Neo-Druidism|Druidry]] is a religion promoting harmony with nature, and drawing on the practices of the druids.

* [[Satanism]] is a broad category of religions that, for example, worship Satan as a deity ([[Theistic Satanism]]) or use Satan as a symbol of carnality and earthly values ([[LaVeyan Satanism]]).

[[Sociological classifications of religious movements]] suggest that within any given religious group, a community can resemble various types of structures, including [[Church (building)|churches]], [[Religious denomination|denominations]], [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s, and [[institution]]s.

==Related aspects==

===Law===
{{main|Law and religion}}
The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witte |first1=John |year=2012 |title=The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report |url= |journal=Ecclesiastical Law Journal |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=327–354 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x12000348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, ''Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham and Brett G.

===Science===
{{Main|Faith and rationality|Relationship between religion and science|Epistemology}}
[[Science]] acknowledges [[reason]], [[empiricism]], and [[evidence]]; and religions include [[revelation]], [[faith]] and [[sacredness]] whilst also acknowledging [[Philosophy of religion|philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stenmark |first1=Mikael |title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model |date=2004 |publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co. |location=Grand Rapids, Mich. |isbn=978-0802828231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri/&gt; The term science emerged in the 19th century out of [[natural philosophy]] in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature ([[natural science]]),&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226482149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"/&gt; It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

In general the [[scientific method]] gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop [[theories]] through elucidation of facts or evaluation by [[experiment]]s and thus only answers [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] questions about the [[universe]] that can be observed and measured. It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as ''[[de facto]]'' verities in general parlance, such as the theories of [[general relativity]] and [[natural selection]] to explain respectively the mechanisms of [[gravity]] and [[evolution]].

Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tolman |first1=Cynthia |title=Methods in Religion |url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |website=Malboro College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion and science, [[Albert Einstein]] states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal God Concept Causes Science-Religion Conflict |journal=The Science News-Letter |date=21 September 1940 |first=Albert |last=Einstein |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=181–182 |jstor=3916567 |doi=10.2307/3916567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
{{Main|Morality and religion}}
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Jems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Theological Aspects of the Avesta|Zoroastrianism's]] good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|last=Esptein|first=Greg M.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-167011-4|edition=|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and morality are not synonymous. While it is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements of Moral Philosophy|last2=Rachels|first2=(ed) Stuart|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-078-03824-2|edition=7|location=New York|page=|last1=Rachels|first1=(ed) James}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Christianity, morality can have a [[Secular morality|secular basis]].

The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.

=== Politics ===
====Impact====
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of [[sharia]], the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57&amp;nbsp;billion people who are [[Muslim world|Muslims]]. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the [[United States]], 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-18?cid1=cust/noenew/n/n/n/20160229n/owned/n/n/nwl/n/n/NA/email The Economist explains: The role of religion in America’s presidential race], ''The Economist'', 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress ([[Kyrsten Sinema]], D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/27/10-facts-about-religion-in-america/|title=10 facts about religion in America|last=Lipka|first=Michael|date=27 Aug 2015|website=|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/04/europe-religion-and-politics Europe, religion and politics:Old world wars], The Economist, 22 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; although it used to be much more important. For instance, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually [[Catholicism|Catholic]]) doctrine. Several [[List of atheists in politics and law|European leaders are atheists]] (e.g. [[France]]’s former president [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]] or Greece's prime minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, [[India]] is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;Lobo, L. 2000 [http://americamagazine.org/issue/276/article/religion-and-politics-india Religion and Politics in India], ''America Magazine'', 19 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, countries such as [[Religion in China|China]] or [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.

====Secularism====
[[File:Ranjitsingh.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ranjit Singh]] established [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] over [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the early 19th century.]]

{{Main|Secularism| Secularization}}
Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the populations religious diversity.

===Economics===

{{Further|Religion and business|Wealth and religion}}
One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web |last=WIN-Gallup |title=Global Index of religion and atheism. |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).&lt;ref name="WIN-Gallup" /&gt;

Sociologist and political economist [[Max Weber]] has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their [[Protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, [1904] 1920. ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study from 2015, [[Christians]] hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by [[Muslims]] (5.8%), [[Hindus]] (3.3%) and [[Jewish]] (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification [[Irreligion]] or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/453467/christians-hold-largest-percentage-global.html6 |title=Christians hold largest percentage of global wealth: Report|publisher=deccanherald.com|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Impacts of religion on health}}
[[Mayo Clinic]] researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."&lt;ref name="Religion and Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul S. |last1=Mueller, MD |first2=David J. |last2=Plevak, MD |first3=Teresa A. |last3=Rummans, MD |title=Religious Involvement, Spirituality, and Medicine: Implications for Clinical Practice |url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0025-6196/PIIS0025619611627997.pdf |quote=We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes.

The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hill |first2=Peter C. |title=The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=February 2001 |first=Kevin S. |last=Seybold |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Religion, Health, and the Psychology of Religion: How the Research on Religion and Health Helps Us Understand Religion |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |year=2004 |first=James W. |last=Jones |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4299-3|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/bilimname/issue/3501/47580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.008|pmid=16359765|title=Gender differences in religious practices, spiritual experiences and health: Results from the US General Social Survey|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=62|issue=11|pages=2848–2860|year=2006|last1=Maselko|first1=Joanna|last2=Kubzansky|first2=Laura D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics like [[Hector Avalos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regina Schwartz]],&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2007"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=God is not Great |publisher=Twelve |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref name="Dawkins 2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that "virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
Done by some (but not all) religions, [[animal sacrifice]] is the [[ritual]] killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a [[deity]]. It has been banned in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/india-court-bans-animal-sacrifice-hindu-temples |title=Indian court bans animal sacrifice |last=France-Presse |first=Agence|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2014-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superstition ===
{{Further|Superstition|Magical thinking|Magic and religion}}
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (''deisidaimonia''), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne 1987, p. 211 {{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] described superstition in [[Ancient Rome]] as an ''[[instrumentum regni]]'', an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]], VI 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superstition has been described as the non rational establishment of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf Kevin R. Foster and Hanna Kokko, "The evolution of superstitious and superstition-like behaviour", ''Proc. R. Soc. B'' (2009) 276, 31–37] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728042608/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf |date=28 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Religion Explained |last=Boyer | first = Pascal |year=2001 |chapter=Why Belief |authorlink=Pascal Boyer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wreF80OHTicC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22fang+too+were+quite+amazed%22|title-link=Religion Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nailed : ten Christian myths that show Jesus never existed at all|last=David|first=Fitzgerald|isbn=9780557709915|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=701249439|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[atheists]], [[deists]], and [[skeptics]] regard religious belief as superstition.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110).  "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16–22" (para. #2111)

===Agnosticism and atheism===
{{Main|Atheism|Agnosticism|Irreligion|Antireligion|Humanism}}
{{See also|Criticism of atheism}}
The terms [[atheist]] (lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.

===Interfaith cooperation===
{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}, many religious practitioners{{who|date=July 2016}} have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]]. The first major dialogue was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Recent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonword.com/|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|work=acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "C1 World Dialogue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|title=konsoleH :: Login|work=c1worlddialogue.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128195027/http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|archivedate=28 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islambuddhism.com/|title=Islam and Buddhism|work=islambuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[United Nations]] sponsored "World Interfaith Harmony Week".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/ World Interfaith Harmony Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/world-interfaith-harmony-week-resolution/|title=» World Interfaith Harmony Week UNGA Resolution A/65/PV.34|work=worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. [[Paul Tillich]] looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Queen, ''
Encyclopedia of American Religious History, Volume 1'' Facts on File, 1996. p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', Robert C. Kimball (ed), (Oxford University Press, 1959). p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ernst Troeltsch]], similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. &lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Sharpe, "Religion and Cultures", An inaugural lecture delivered on 6 July, 1977 by Eric J. Sharpe, Professor of Religious Studies in the University of Sydney. Accessed at [https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/ART/article/download/5496/6167 Openjournals] on June 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Taslima Nasreen, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/i-say-three-cheers-for-ayaan/232289 "I Say, Three Cheers For Ayaan",] ''Outlook, The Magazine'' 28 August 2006. Also, Nemani Delaibatiki, [http://fijisun.com.fj/2017/07/08/religion-and-the-vanua/ "Religion and the Vanua"] ''Fiji Sun'' July 08, 2017 in which the distinctive elements of culture against religion are taken from Domenic Marbaniang, [https://philpapers.org/bbs/thread.pl?tId=959 "Difference Between Culture and Religion: A Proposal Requesting Response"], 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of religion}}

The relationship between '''religion and [[HIV/AIDS]]''' is complicated, and often controversial. Controversies have mainly revolved around [[LGBT]] people and [[condom]] use.

==Religious attitudes towards HIV-positive people and AIDS==
===Islam===

The question of Islam and [[AIDS]] has arisen in recent years as the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic has grown stronger, with awareness and efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1157962465531&amp;pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience%2FHSELayout |title=Tackling AIDS Through Islam? |author=Najma Mohamed |work=Islam Online |accessdate=26 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529085511/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1157962465531&amp;pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience%2FHSELayout |archivedate=May 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Muslims view the AIDS epidemic through what is called the “prism of sin”, and as the consequence of sinful behavior, such as [[prostitution]], sex with multiple partners or [[promiscuity]].&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"/&gt; Awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is growing among the Muslim community and efforts are being initiated to prevent its spread. The Muslim Awareness Programme (MAP), based in South Africa is a faith-based organization that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention strategies based on the moral teachings of Islam. These activities include the promotion of [[abstinence]] from all sexual activity outside marriage; refraining from drug use, and instilling faithfulness within marriage. According to most Muslims, the key to combating to the HIV/AIDS epidemic is prevention.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In their view, the Islamic position on morality, chastity and the sanctity of marriage needs to be shared with the world. Islam cites sex with multiple partners, sex outside marriage, other promiscuous sexual behaviors and [[homosexuality]] as immoral and as a result of this some Muslims consider this behavior the main cause of HIV/AIDS, believing that promoting abstinence, chastity, and intramarital sex is the key to ending or at least containing the epidemic.

===Judaism and Jewish thinkers===
As opposed to the Catholic Church and some other denominations or religions, today, there isn't any central Jewish religious authority that is acceptable by vast majority of religious Jews or by most Jewish religious movements.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] links between immoral sexual behavior and AIDS. [[Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits]], former Chief Rabbi of England, a prominent figure in 20th century Jewish medical ethics&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits]]&lt;/ref&gt; maintains in his article "Halachic Perspectives on AIDS" that "... from my reading of Jewish sources, it would appear that under no circumstances would we be justified in branding the incidence of the disease (...) as punishment ... we have not the vision, that would enable us to link, as an assertion of certainty, any form of human travail, grief, bereavement or suffering in general with shortcomings of a moral nature... It is one thing to speak of a consequence, and it is quite another thing to speak of a punishment ... if you warn a child not to play with fire, lest he gets burnt, and the child then gets burnt, then the burning may not be a punishment for not listening, but it certainly is a consequence. ...

=== Christianity ===
Many Christian charities provide services for people living with HIV/AIDS.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} One example is the [[DREAM (AIDS therapy program)|"Drug Resources Enhancement against Aids and Malnutrition" (DREAM)]], program promoted by the [[Christian]] [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].

[[Jerry Falwell]] regularly linked the [[AIDS pandemic]] to LGBT issues and stated, "AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals."&lt;ref name="Falwell"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.milforddailynews.com/opinion/x1987843539|title=Press: The Sad Legacy of Jerry Falwell|accessdate=2007-05-18|last= Press|first = Bill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430144811/http://www.milforddailynews.com/opinion/x1987843539 |archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
[[Hinduism]] has shown support for research aimed at curing HIV/AIDS, and care for those affected by HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Tackling AIDS"/&gt;

==Prevention==
===Catholicism===
{{main|Catholic Church and AIDS}}
The Catholic Church opposes [[condom]] use between heterosexual couples because it is an artificial form of [[contraception]] that does not rely on the functions of the body (and thus also God's will) itself as to whether a conception will occur or not, and the Church believes it also serves to implicitly and inexcusably encourage premarital and extramarital sexuality (and recourse to abortion if the condom fails).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Pope John Paul II]] strongly opposed the use of artificial birth control, and rejected the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name="John Paul II and condoms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1979145,00.html|title=Catholic Church to Ease Ban on Condom Use|date=24 April 2006|publisher=© 2006, 2009 Deutsche Welle|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated in 2005 that condoms were not a sufficient solution to the AIDS crisis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Pope rejects condoms for Africa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm | date=2005-06-10 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then in 2009 claimed that AIDS "cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|title=Pope Benedict XVI: condoms make Aids crisis worse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/5005357/Pope-Benedict-XVI-condoms-make-Aids-crisis-worse.html | date=2009-03-17 | accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moscow Patriarchate]] gave support to Benedict XVI's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/africa/story.php?id=32756 |title=Moscow Patriarchate Backs Pope's Stance on Condoms |publisher=Zenit News Agency |date=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Benedict XVI's statements, the [[United Church of Christ]] issued a statement encouraging condom distribution at places of worship.&lt;ref name="UCC and condoms"&gt;[http://www.ucc.org/news/uccs-health-advocates-press.html UCC’s health advocates press for increased condom distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2010, when questioned about the rampant HIV spread in Africa, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] suggested that the use of condoms in male prostitution is not a moral solution to stopping AIDS, but could represent a first step in assuming moral responsibility "in the intention of reducing the risk of infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101120/ap_on_re_eu/eu_pope_condoms |title=Pope says some condom use first step of morality |website=Yahoo News |publisher=Associated Press |date=20 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121121202/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101120/ap_on_re_eu/eu_pope_condoms |archivedate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatican City clarifies, after Benedict's statement sows confusion, that the position of the Church on condoms has not changed. It is merely a statement that in homosexual relations, where unnatural contraception is not the main concern, condoms can be seen as moral responsibility in preventing HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-11-20-pope-condoms_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Vatican clarifies pope's condom comments: Nothing's changed | date=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, 2010, Benedict furthermore stated that the concept of condoms as a lesser evil in preventing HIV infections can be applied to women as well. The use of condoms is the first step in taking responsibility and attempting to prevent the infection of one's partner. The Pope does not say anything about condoms being acceptable as unnatural birth control, only as a responsible approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40331930/ns/world_news-europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In Thailand, some Buddhist monks encourage the use of condoms for HIV prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=52,3702,0,0,1,0|title=Buddhist Monk Embraces Condoms|date=2007-02-07|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of [[Mechai Viravaidya]]'s pro-condom campaign, Buddhist monks have offered blessed condoms for couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/rxforsurvival/series/champions/mechai_viravaidya.html|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|title = Global Health Champions: Mechai Viravaidya|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The work of some Christian ministries has affected the treatment of AIDS. According to the African Health Policy Network, some churches in [[London]] claim that prayer will cure AIDS and the [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reports that several people have stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their [[pastor]], leading to a number of deaths.&lt;ref name=BBC18102011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|title=Church HIV prayer cure claims 'cause three deaths'|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=18 October 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Synagogue Church Of All Nations]] advertise an "anointing water" to promote God's healing, although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication,&lt;ref name=BBC18102011 /&gt; and US [[patent application]] 2001051133 similarly suggests that intravenous pure distilled water will eradicate HIV through the mercy of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2001051133|status=application}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian churches actively distribute HIV/AIDS medication.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

{{Hinduism}}
The [[Sangam period]] in [[Tamilakam]] (c. 500 BCE to 300 CE) was characterized by the coexistence of many religions: [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] alongside the [[ethnic religion]]s of the [[Tamil people]]. The monarchs of the time practiced religious tolerance and openly encouraged religious discussions and invited teachers of every sect to the public halls to preach their doctrines.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=233}}

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Tamils}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Tamil religions==
Tamil religions denotes the religious traditions and practices of Tamil-speaking people. The Tamils are native to modern state of India known as [[Tamil Nadu]] and the northern and eastern part of [[Sri Lanka]]. Tamils lives also outside their native boundaries due to migration such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Great Britain]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Réunion]], [[Myanmar]], [[Mauritius]] and in countries in [[Europe]]. Many emigrant Tamils retain elements of a cultural, linguistic, and religious tradition that predates the Christian era.

===Early Tamil religion===
A Neolithic cattle-herding culture existed in [[South India]] several millennia prior to the Christian era. By the first century, a relatively well-developed civilization had emerged. It is described in some detail in Tamil texts such as the [[Tholkappiyam]] (third BCE) and by the Sankam poets—an "academy" of poets who wrote in the first two centuries of the Common Era.

Ancient Tamil grammatical works [[Tholkappiyam]], the ten anthologies [[Pathuppāṭṭu]], the eight anthologies [[Eṭṭuttokai]] sheds light on early religion of ancient Tamil people. [[Murugan]] was glorified as, ''the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent,'' as ''the favored god of the Tamils.''&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"&gt;Kanchan Sinha, Kartikeya in Indian art and literature, Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiva]] was also seen as the supreme God.&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"/&gt; Early iconography of [[Murugan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham|title=A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery|year=2006|publisher=harappa.com|url=http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904034700/http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|archivedate=2006-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shiva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of India: A Historical Survey| author = Ranbir Vohra| publisher = M.E.

Schweig| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2006| page = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their association with native flora and fauna goes back to Indus Valley Civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Basham|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Plants of life, plants of death| author = Frederick J. Simoons| year = 1998| page = 363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sangam landscape]] was classified into five categories, ''thinais'', based on the mood, the season and the land. [[Tolkappiyam]], mentions that each of these ''thinai'' had an associated deity such [[Murugan]] in ''Kurinji''-the hills, [[Thirumal]] in ''Mullai''-the forests, [[Kotravai|Kaali]] in ''Pālai''-the deserts, [[Indra]] in ''Marutham''-the plains and [[Varuna]] in ''Neithal''-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] who were all assimilated into Sangam religion over time. Dravidian influence on early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known [[Indo-Aryan language]], the language of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed to [[Dravidian languages]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=6}} This represents an early religious and cultural fusion{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=50}}{{refn|name=Lockard|Lockard: "The encounters that resulted from Aryan migration brought together several very different peoples and cultures, reconfiguring Indian society. Over many centuries a fusion of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryan]] and [[Tamil people]] occurred, a complex process that historians have labeled the Indo-Aryan synthesis."{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=50}} Lockard: "Hinduism can be seen historically as a synthesis of Aryan beliefs with Harappan and other Tamil traditions that developed over many centuries."{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=52}}}} or synthesis{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}} between ancient Tamils and Indo-Aryans, which became more evident over time with sacred iconography, flora and fauna that went on to influence Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.{{sfn|Tiwari|2002|p=v}}{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=218-219}}{{sfn|Larson|1995|p=81}}

The cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thiruchandran|first=Selvy|title=Ideology, caste, class, and gender|year=1997|publisher=Vikas Pub.

===Veriyattam===
"Veriyattam" refers to [[spirit possession]] of women, who took part in priestly functions. Under the influence of the god, women sang and danced, but also read the dim past, predicted the future, diagnosed diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=Srinivasa|title=History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 A.D.|year=1929|publisher=Asian Educational Services|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty two poets of the Sangam age in as many as 40 poems portray Veriyatal. Velan is a reporter and prophet endowed with supernatural powers. Veriyatal had been performed by men as well as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.K. |last=Venkatasubramanian|title=Music as History in TamilNadu|year=2010|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=9380607067|pages=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzurjfF3AE4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Twenty+two+poets+of+the+Sangam+age+in+as+many+as#v=onepage&amp;q=Twenty%20two%20poets%20of%20the%20Sangam%20age%20in%20as%20many%20as&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nadukkal===
Among the early Tamils the practice of erecting [[hero stone]]s (''nadukkal'') had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shashi|first=S. S.|title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh: Volume 100|year=1996|publisher=Anmol Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Subramanium|first=N.|title=Śaṅgam polity: the administration and social life of the Śaṅgam Tamils|year=1980|publisher=Ennes Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theyyam===

[[Theyyam]] is a ritual shaman dance popular in [[Kerala]] and parts of Tamil Nadu and [[Karnataka]]. Theyyam migrates into the artist who has assumed the spirit and it is a belief that the god or goddess comes in the midst of fathering through the medium of possessed dancer. The dancer throws rice on the audience and distributes turmeric powder as symbols of blessing. Theyyam incorporates dance, mime and music and enshrines the rudiments of ancient tribal cultures which attached great importance to the worship of heroes and the spirits of ancestors,  is a socio-religious ceremony. There are over 400 Theyyams performed, the most spectacular ones are those of Raktha Chamundi, Kari Chamundi, Muchilottu Bhagavathi, Wayanadu Kulaven, Gulikan and Pottan. These are performed in front of shrines, sans stage or curtains.

The early character of Tamil religion was celebrative. It embodied an aura of sacral immanence, sensing the sacred in the vegetation, fertility, and color of the land. The summum bonum of the religious experience was expressed in terms of possession by the god, or ecstasy. Into this milieu there immigrated a sobering influence—a growing number of Jain and Buddhist communities and an increasing influx of northerners.

The layout of villages can be assumed to be standard across most villages. An Amman (mother goddess) is at the centre of the villages while a male [[Village deities of Tamil Nadu|guardian deity]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic= காவல் கடவுள்|trans=kāval kaṭavuḷ}}) has a shrine at the village borders. Nowadays, Amman can be either worshipped alone or as a part of the Vedic pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 14|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divinity of kings==

===Pre-Sangam and Sangam age===
Throughout Tamil Nadu, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=William P.|title=The sacred marriage of a Hindu goddess|year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King was 'the representative of God on earth' and lived in a ''koyil'', which means the "residence of God". The Modern Tamil word for temple is [[koil]] ({{lang-ta|கோயில்}}). Titular worship was also given to Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anand|first=Mulk Raj|title=Splendours of Tamil Nadu |year=1980|publisher=Marg Publications|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;noj=1&amp;prmdo=1&amp;biw=1067&amp;bih=565&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=The+king+is+%27the+representative+of+God+on+earth%27+and+lives+in+a+palace+called+%27+Koyil%27%2C+which+means+the+residence+of+God.+The+ritual+worship+of+God&amp;oq=The+king+is+%27the+representative+of+God+on+earth%27+and+lives+in+a+palace+called+%27+Kovil%27%2C+which+means+the+residence+of+God.+The+ritual+worship+of+God&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3...0.0.0.8227.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0.DdIt9d1ZNjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Pran Nath|title=History of South India|year=1979|publisher=S.

Words meaning 'King', like ''kō'' ({{lang-ta|கோ}} "King"), ''iṟai'' ({{lang|ta|இறை}} "Emperor") and ''āṇḍavan'' ({{lang|ta|ஆண்டவன்}} "Conqueror") now primarily refer to Gods.

At the birth of [[Raja Raja Chola I]], the Thiruvalangadu inscription states, "Having noticed by the marks (on his body) that Arulmozhi was the very [[Thirumal]], the protector of the three worlds, descended on earth..."

[[File:Subrahmanya Temple, Saluvanakuppam front view.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Murugan]] temple at Salavanakuppam near [[Mahabalipuram]]]]

The brick temple excavated in 2005&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/21/stories/2005092104692000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; dates to the [[Sangam period]] and is believed to be the oldest Hindu temple to be found in Tamil Nadu. The temple faces north, unlike most Hindu temples which face either east or west and is believed to have been constructed even before ''shilpa shastras'' were written

[[File:Skanda, from Kannuaj.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|Sculpture of the god Murugan]]
During the Sangam period, [[Shiva]], [[Murugan]], [[Thirumal]] and Kotravai were some of the popular [[deity|deities]]. The poetic division of the landscape into [[Sangam landscape#Poetic Attributes of the Landscapes|five regions]] also associated each region with its own patron deity.{{sfn|Subrahmanian|1972|p=381}}
The people of the pastoral lands or the [[Sangam landscape#Mullai .E2.80.93 Forests|Mullai]] regions worshipped [[Thirumal]]. The [[Sangam landscape#Marutham .E2.80.93 Cropland|Marutham]] people worshipped [[Indra]] or ''Ventan'', while the [[Sangam landscape#Neithal .E2.80.93 Seashore|Neithal]] people considered [[Varuna]]n or ''Katalon'' to be their patron deity and the [[Sangam landscape#Paalai .E2.80.93 Wastelands|Palai]] people worshipped [[Korravai]] or [[Kali]]. Other popular deities of this age were [[Kama]] the god of love, [[Surya]] the sun, [[Chandra]] the moon and [[Yama]] the god of death. The [[Brahmin]]s of the Tamil country attached great importance to the performance of Vedic sacrifices. Priests learned in the Vedic rites typically performed them under the patronage of the kings.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=231}}

The temples of the Sangam age were built out of perishable materials such as plaster, timber and brick, which is why little trace of them is found today.{{sfn|Subrahmanian|1972|p=382}} The only public structures of any historical importance belonging to this age that have survived to this day are the rock-beds hewn out of natural rock formation, that were made for the ascetics. The ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' and the Sangam poems such as ''[[Kaliththokai]]'', ''[[Mullaippāṭṭu]]'' and ''[[Purananuru]]'' mention several kinds of temples such as the ''Puranilaikkottam'' or the temple at the outskirts of a city, the ''Netunilaikkottam'' or the tall temple, the ''Palkunrakkottam'' the temple on top of a hill, the ''Ilavantikaippalli'' or the temple with a garden and bathing ghat, the ''Elunilaimatam'' or a seven storeyed temple, the ''Katavutkatinakar'' or the temple city.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnan|2005|p=19}}

Some of the popular festivals of this age were [[Karthikai Deepam|Karthigaideepam]], Tiruvonam, Kaman vizha and Indira vizha. Karthigaideepam was otherwise known as Peruvizha and was celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai every year. The Kaaman vizha was held in the spring and during this festival, men and women dressed up well and participated in dancing. Indravizha included the performance of Vedic sacrifices, prayers to various gods, musical recitals and dancing.{{sfn|Balambal|1998|p=6}}

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Tamil Jain}}
The exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jains flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the [[Sangam period]]. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), [[Tolkāppiyam]], was a Jain.&lt;ref name=Encyclopaedia&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Singh  | first = Narendra   | title = Encyclopaedia of Jainism  | publisher = Anmol Publications  | year = 2001  | pages = 3144  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pHZwgrLlOkUC&amp;dq  | isbn = 978-81-261-0691-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Tamil Nadu that date from the 2nd century BCE. They are regarded to be associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.&lt;ref&gt;Early Tamil epigraphy from the earliest times to the sixth century A.D. Iravatham Mahadevan, Harvard University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=595&amp;cat=42 Recent Discoveries of Jaina Cave Inscriptions in Tamilnadu by Iravatham Mahadevan&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars consider the [[Tirukkural]] by [[Valluvar]] to be the work by a Jain.&lt;ref&gt;Tirukkural, Vol. 1,  S.M. Diaz, Ramanatha Adigalar Foundation, 2000,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiruvalluvar and his Tirukkural, Bharatiya Jnanapith, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Kural, P. S. Sundaram, Penguin Classics, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It emphatically supports vegetarianism (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than a thousand offerings in fire (verse 259).

[[Silappatikaram]], a major work in Tamil literature, was written by a Camaṇa, [[Ilango Adigal]]. It describes the historical events of its time and also of the then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and [[Shaivism]]. The main characters of this work, [[Kannagi]] and [[Kovalan]], who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains.

According to [[George L. Hart]], the legend of the [[Tamil Sangams]] or "literary assemblies: was based on the Jain ''sangham'' at [[Madurai]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 CE in Maturai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the cangkam legend."&lt;ref&gt;The Milieu of the Ancient Tamil Poems, Prof. George Hart&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jainism began to decline around the 8th century, with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially [[Shaivism]]. Still, the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Pandya Dynasty|Pandya]] dynasties embraced Jainism.

==Buddhism==
{{Main article|Tamil Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.6|Footprint of Buddha engraved on stone, c. 1st century CE]]

The [[Buddhist]]s worshiped the impressions of [[Buddha]]’s feet engraved on stone and platforms made of stone that represented his seat. The pious Buddhist walked round them, with his right side towards them and bowed his head as a token of reverence.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=232}} The [[Cilapatikaram|Silapatikaram]] mentions that the [[monk]]s worshipped Buddha by praising him as the wise, holy and virtuous teacher who adhered to his vows strictly, as the one who subdued anger and all evil passions and as the refuge of all mankind. [[Manimekalai]] is a sequel to the Silapathikaram, which tellst the story of [[Buddhism]] of the daughter of [[Kovalan]] and [[Madhavi (Silappatikaram)|Madhavi]].

In the Buddhist [[Viharas]] or monasteries, learned monks preached their sermons, seated in a place which was entirely concealed from the view of the audience. The Buddhists did not observe the distinctions of caste and invited all ranks to assemble on a footing of equality. Self-control, wisdom and charity were among the virtues preached and practiced by the monks, who were numerous in the ancient Tamil country.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=233}}

==Judaism==

The traditional account is that traders from [[Judea]] arrived in the city of [[Cochin]], Kerala in 562 BCE, and that more Jews came as exiles from Israel in the year 70 CE after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref name="TheShengold"&gt;P. 125 ''The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia'' By Mordecai Schreiber&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct Jewish community was called [[Anjuvannam]].

==Philosophies of religion==

===Secularism===
The secular identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Tamil Literature: Introductory articles|year=1990|publisher=Institute of Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[Sangam literature]] is often celebrated to represent the tolerance among [[Tamil people]]. Es Vaiyāpurip Piḷḷai, concludes in his ''History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piḷḷai|first=Es Vaiyāpurip|title=History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A.

D.''&lt;center&gt;}} Most scholars agree that the lack of 'god' should not be inferred to be atheistic. The [[Tamil books of Law]], particularly the [[Tirukkural]], is considered as the [[Perennial philosophy]] of [[Tamil culture]] because of its universalisability.

===Ūzh and Vinai===
Ūzh meaning 'fate' or 'destiny'  and vinai meaning 'works' concerns the ancient [[Tamil people|Tamil]] belief of differentiating what man can do and what is destined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Tamil studies, Issues 31–32|year=1987|publisher=International Association of Tamil Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaṭavuḷ and Iyavuḷ===
Sangam [[Tamil people]] understood two distinct characteristics of Godhood. [[Transcendence (religion)|God who is beyond all]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=கடவுள்|trans=Kaṭavuḷ}}) and the [[Primum movens|God who sets things in motion]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=இயவுள்|trans=Iyavuḷ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singam|first=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20542">'''Religious Identity''' is a specific type of [[identity formation]]. Particularly, it is the sense of group membership to a religion and the importance of this group membership as it pertains to one's [[self-concept]]. Religious identity is not necessarily the same as religiousness or [[religiosity]]. Although these three terms share a commonality, religiousness and religiosity refer to both the value of religious group membership as well as participation in religious events (e.g. going to church).&lt;ref name="ArweckNesbitt2010"&gt;Arweck, E. &amp; Nesbitt, E. (2010). Young people's identity formation in mixed-faith families: continuity or discontinuity of religious traditions? Journal of Contemporary Religion, 25, 67-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KingWhitbeck1997"&gt;King, V. Elder, G.H., Whitbeck, L.B. (1997). Religious involvement among rural youth: An ecological and life-course perspective. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 7, 431-456.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious identity, on the other hand, refers specifically to religious group membership regardless of religious activity or participation. 

Similar to other forms of identity formation, such as ethnic and [[cultural identity]], the religious context can generally provide a perspective from which to view the world, opportunities to socialize with a spectrum of individuals from different generations, and a set of basic principles to live out.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004"&gt;King, P.E. &amp; Boyatzis, C.J. (2004). Exploring adolescent spiritual and religious development: current and future theoretical and empirical perspectives. Applied Developmental Science, 8, 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt; These foundations can come to shape an individual's identity.

Despite the implications that religion has on identity development, the identity formation literature has mainly focused on ethnicity and gender and has largely discounted the role of religion. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies have begun to include religion as a factor of interest.&lt;ref name="ArweckNesbitt2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee2002"&gt;Lee, J.J. (2002). Religion and college attendance: Change among students. The Review of Higher Education, 25, 369-384.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these studies use religious identity, religiosity, and religiousness interchangeably or solely focus on religious identity and solely religious participation as separate constructs.

Of these types of research studies, researchers have examined the various factors that affect the strength of one's religious identity over time.&lt;ref name="Arnett2000"&gt;Arnett, J.J. (2000).

'Identity' is one of the most used terms in the social sciences and has different senses in different research paradigms. In addition to psychological studies, sociologists and anthropologists also apply the term 'religious identity' and examine its related processes in given social contexts. For example, one important study conducted in the United States after the events of September 11 2001, explored the meaning-making among American Muslims&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peek|first=Lori|date=2005|title=Becoming Muslim: The Development of a Religious Identity|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article/66/3/215/1665611|journal=Sociology of Religion|language=en|volume=66|issue=3|pages=215|doi=10.2307/4153097|issn=1069-4404}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how changes in identity ascription (what people think about another group of people) affected how Muslims sought to represent themselves. Other studies have applied concepts appropriated from race and gender identity theory such as disidentification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin-Stożek|first=Daniel|last2=Schirr|first2=Bertram J.|date=2017-09-03|title=Identification and disidentification in reported schooling experiences of adolescent Muslims in England|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03054985.2017.1352353|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=43|issue=5|pages=580–595|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1352353|issn=0305-4985}}&lt;/ref&gt; which undermines essentialist accounts of religious identity - that an individual has a 'fixed' religious identity, independent of pre-existing systems of representation and individuals' positioning within them.  

== History ==
During the early 1800s in the field of psychology, research on the topic of religion was considered important and ubiquitous. For example, researchers like [[G. Stanley Hall]] and [[William James]] conducted studies on such topics as religious conversion.&lt;ref name="Hall1904"&gt;Hall, G. S. (1904). Adolescence, Vol. II. New York: Appleton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Youniss1999"&gt;Youniss, J., McLellan, J.A., &amp; Yates, M. (1999). Religion, community service, and identity in American youth. Journal Adolescence, 22, 243-253.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the public perspective on religion began to shift two decades later.&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt; Instead of religion being seen as an integral part of an individual's life and development and thus a necessary topic to research, scientists and scholars alike viewed religion as a hindrance to the progression of science and as a topic no longer applicable to the current times.&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SiegelWhite1982"&gt;Siegel, A.W., &amp; White, S.H. (1982). The child study movement. In Advances in Child Development and Behavior. Reese, H. W. (Ed.). New York: Academic press, pp. 233-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson1928"&gt;Watson, J.B. (1928). Psychological Care of Infant and Child. New York, NY: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to social scientists' prediction of the general decline of religion over time and increase of secularization leading to a complete abandonment of religious studies, religion did not diminish and was instead acknowledged by researchers as a topic worthwhile to research. Scientists and scholars, like British sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]], realized that despite the neglect of religion in studies, the presence and impact of religion on individuals' lives were undeniable and did not disappear with time.&lt;ref name="Thompson1995"&gt;Thompson, J.B. (1995). The Media and Modernity: a social theory of the media. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a body of research on religion began to take root. Particularly, a handful of researchers were interested in examining religious identity during adolescence.

== Factors that affect religious identity ==
Given that religious traditions can be intricately interlaced with various aspects of culture, the religious identity literature has consistently yielded ethnic, gender, and generational differences.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;Lopez, A.B., Huynh, V.W., &amp; Fuligni, A.J.

According to [[Social Identity Theory]], when individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds feel as if their identity is threatened, they may emphasize their other social identities as a means to maintain a positive self-concept.&lt;ref name="TajfelTurner2001"&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. (2001). An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In M. A. Hogg &amp; D. Abrams (Eds.), Relations: Essential readings. Key readings in social psychology (pp. 94-109). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is supported by the various studies that have shown higher levels of religious identity among ethnic minorities, particularly those from Latino and African American backgrounds, compared to European Americans.&lt;ref name="Wallace2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;

=== Gender Differences ===
Gender may also impact one's religious identity. Generally, females are more likely than males to attend religious services and express that religion is an important aspect of their lives.&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; Studies have captured this gender difference through observations of females reporting greater religious attitudes.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; This was also shown in a four-year longitudinal study on religious involvement for adolescents living in rural settings. Females tended to be more involved in church-related activities than males and were more likely to view themselves as religious individuals.

=== Immigrant Generational Differences ===
There are three categories of generational status: First, Second, and Third. An individual who is considered to be first generation is one who was born outside of the United States and immigrated. Second generation refers to an individual who was born in the United States but whose parent(s) were foreign-born and immigrated. Lastly, third generation refers to an individual and the individual's parents were born in the United States. 

First and second generation individuals may tend to have particularly higher religious identity levels in comparison to third generation immigrants.&lt;ref name="Harker2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt; In efforts to adjust to the stressful changes associated with the immigration process, finding a community of emotional, social, and financial support, an environment typically provided by a place of worship, may be highly sought after by immigrants.&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt; Studies have indeed revealed that adolescents from immigrant families (both first and second generation immigrants) reported higher levels of religious identity compared to adolescents whose parents are not immigrants (third generation).&lt;ref name="Harker2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt;

'''Institutional factors'''

Studies suggest that institutional factors impact on religious identity. For example in a study of Christians, Jews and Muslims in English secondary schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|date=2014-08-08|title=Religious identity choices in English secondary schools|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/berj.3151|journal=British Educational Research Journal|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=489–504|doi=10.1002/berj.3151|issn=0141-1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; adolescents reported negative representations of their religious traditions in the curriculum and common stereotypes held by their peers. These negative ascriptions were perceived by participants to influence their strategies of representing themselves, including hiding their religious affiliations or attempting to pre-empt criticism or bullying by representing the traditions they identified with in an apologetic conciliatory manner.

== Religious identity trajectories ==
By and large, numerous studies have observed ethnic, gender, and generational differences in religious identity. However, there have not been as many longitudinal studies on the influence of ethnicity, gender, and generational status on individuals' development of religious identity over time. Nevertheless, of the handful of such studies, researchers have focused mainly on adolescence&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="King2003"&gt;King, P.E. (2003). Religion and identity: The role of ideological, social, and spiritual contexts. Applied Developmental Science, 7, 197-204.&lt;/ref&gt; and started to branch out to emerging adulthood.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005"&gt;Barry, C.M., &amp; Nelson, L.J. (2005). The role of religion in the transition to adulthood for young emerging adults. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 4, 245-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2010"&gt;Barry, C.M., &amp; Nelson, L.J., Davarya, S., &amp; Urry, S. (2010). Religiosity and spirituality during the transition to adulthood. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 34, 311-324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007"&gt;Uecker, J.E., Regnerus, M., &amp; Vaaler, M.L. (2007). Losing my religion: The social sources of religious decline in early adulthood. Social Forces, 85, 1667-1692.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Researchers have been particularly interested in studying identity during adolescence because it is a developmental period crucial to identity development. During this period, adolescents have opportunities to explore their ethnic, cultural, and religious traditions.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt; However, the freedom and flexibility of their exploration is typically within the constraints of their parents or caregiver.

It was believed that religious identity and participation would both follow the same trajectory and decrease across time; hence, the studies that examined religiousness, which combines the two constructs.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; Although religious affiliation, identity, and participation are closely related, longitudinal research on adolescents suggests that these constructs have different trajectories from one another. For example, researchers have found that religious affiliation and identity for adolescents remained fairly stable across the high school years, which contradicts the expected change in religious affiliation from affiliated to unaffiliated and decrease in religious identity.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;

However, the stability of adolescent religious identity parallels that of other social identities such as ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Fuligni2008"&gt;Fuligni, A. J., Kiang, L., Witkow, M. R., &amp; Baldelomar, O. (2008). Stability and change in ethnic labeling among adolescents from Asian and Latin American immigrant families. Child Development, 79(4), 944-956.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have reasoned that due to adolescents' relatively stable social environment, there is not a strong need to further explore and renegotiate their religious identity.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; Moreover, religious identity is mainly driven by parents during adolescence.&lt;ref name="Denham2004"&gt;Denham, S.A. et al. (2004) Paper presented at the biennial Conference on Human Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that adolescents tend to still live with their parents during high school, there may not be a need to engage in deeper exploration of their religion, which may help explain the observed stable religious identity. 

Whereas religious affiliation and identity remain stable, religious participation tends to decrease.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; Adolescents may exercise their increased autonomy and choose not to attend religious events. Particularly, adolescents may find other activities (e.g. studying, clubs, and sports) vying for their time and resources and choose to prioritize those activities over religious events. The significant decline in religious participation at the end of high school may be a precursor to further decline during emerging adulthood.

=== Emerging Adulthood ===
Adolescence has been traditionally associated with a time of identity exploration. However, that exploration process is not complete by the end of adolescence. Rather, emerging adulthood, the years between late teens and late twenties, extends the identity formation process from adolescence.&lt;ref name="Arnett2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valde1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitbourneTesch1985" /&gt; 

This transitional period is marked by constant changes in romantic love, work, and worldviews&lt;ref name="Arnett2000" /&gt; and is generally a time of "semiautonomy."&lt;ref name="Goldscheider1994"&gt;Goldscheider, F., &amp; Goldscheider, C. (1994). Leaving and returning home in 20th century America. Population Bulletin, 48(4), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldscheiderDaVanzo1986"&gt;Goldscheider, F., DaVanzo, J. (1986). Semiautonomy and leaving home in early adulthood. Social Forces, 65, 187-201.&lt;/ref&gt; With this increased sense of autonomy, emerging adults may choose to further exert their independence by moving away from home and/or by attending college. Through whichever ways that emerging adults choose to exercise their autonomy, they are likely to find themselves in new, diverse environments teeming with a spectrum of vast worldviews.

Despite the necessity for studies on religious identity, there has been limited work on the role of religion in identity formation in emerging adults. Compared to the research in adolescence, there is much less work on the development of religious identity and religious participation across the emerging adulthood years. The combination of immense and frequent changes, increased autonomy, and diverse environments during this period has major ramifications for the development of emerging adults' religious affiliation, religious identity, and religious participation. 

Religion was believed to have little impact on emerging adults' identity, particularly for those who attend college&lt;ref name="BrinkerhoffMarlene1993"&gt;Brinkerhoff, M.B., &amp; Marlene, M.M. (1993). Casting Off the Bonds of Organized Religion: A Religious-Careers Approach to the Study of Apostasy. Review of Religious Research 34:235-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HunsbergerBrown1984"&gt;Hunsberger, B., &amp; L.B., Brown. (1984). Religious socialization, apostasy, and the impact of family background. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 23, 239-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PewForum"&gt;Pew Forum, o. R. a. P. L. (2008). U.S. Religious Landscape Survey (Report).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WillitsCrider1989"&gt;Willits, F.K. &amp; Crider, D.M. (1989). Church Attendance and Traditional Religious Beliefs in Adolescence and Young Adulthood: A Panel Study. Review of Religious Research, 31, 68-81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent research suggests otherwise.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt; According to a study, while 14 percent of college students reported a decrease in religious beliefs throughout college, 48 percent reported stable religious beliefs, and 38 percent reported an increase.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;

Moreover, another study found that contrary to the expectations of decreased religious identity and religious participation during emerging adulthood, religious identity did not decrease, but religious participation did decline as predicted.&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt; Researchers explained that emerging adults are more likely to decrease their involvement in religious activities than they are to completely disaffiliate from their religion or express less importance of religion in their lives.

Additionally, in a study that examined the ways in which religion influenced emerging adults, researchers found that emerging adults' standards of adulthood were dependent upon the religious affiliation of the institution they attended.&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005" /&gt; For example, compared to emerging adults who attended Catholic or public universities, emerging adults who attended Mormon universities rated interdependence, norm compliance, biological transitions, and family capacities as extremely important criteria for adulthood. 

In summary, although not all studies on this topic are in agreement, religious identity generally tends to remain stable during emerging adulthood whereas religious participation decreases over time.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt;

|[[Afghanistan]]
|Population 31,410,000, Christian 0.1%, Muslim 99.7%
|Sunni Muslim 80%, Shia Muslim 19%, other 1%
|Christian 0.1%, Muslim 99.7%
|Reliable data on religious demography is difficult to obtain because an official nationwide census has not been conducted in decades. U.S. government estimates indicate a population of approximately 30.4 million, with Sunni Muslims comprising 80 percent of the population, Shia Muslims making up about 19 percent, and other religious groups comprising less than 1 percent. The Ismailis, who self identify as a Shia denomination, comprise approximately 5 percent of the total population. Leaders of minority religious communities estimate there are 350 Sikh families and 30 Hindu families. Estimates of the Bahá'í and Christian communities are less clear because neither group practices openly for fear of persecution. Reportedly, the Christian community is between 500 and 8,000 persons and the Bahá'í community is approximately 2,000 persons. In addition, there are small numbers of practitioners of other religions. There is one known Jewish citizen.
There are three active gurdwaras (Sikh places of worship) in Kabul and 10 in other parts of the country; there were 64 gurdwaras throughout the country before the mujahideen era, when many were seized. There are five remaining Hindu mandirs (temples) in three cities: two in Kabul, one of which shares a wall with a mosque, one in Jalalabad, one in Helmand, and one in Kandahar.
Afghanistan's last known Jew maintains Kabul's sole synagogue, and there are also three defunct synagogues in Herat, which are no longer in use for lack of a Jewish community. There are no public Christian churches. Afghan Christians worship alone or in small congregations in private homes. Many Afghan Christians converted while living as refugees in third countries. Chapels and churches for noncitizens of various faiths are located on several military bases, Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and at the Italian embassy in Kabul. Buddhist foreigners are free to worship in Hindu temples.
Followers of the Bahá'í Faith have practiced in the country for approximately 150 years. The community is predominantly based in Kabul, although some Bahá'ís remain in Kandahar.

|[[Albania]]
|Population 3,200,000, Christian 18.0%, Muslim 80.3%, Unaffiliated 1.4%, Other Religion 0.2%
|Muslim 56.7%, Roman Catholic 10%, Orthodox 6.8%, atheist 2.5%, Bektashi (a Sufi order) 2.1%, other 5.7%, unspecified 16.2%
note: all mosques and churches were closed in 1967 and religious observances prohibited; in November 1990, Albania began allowing private religious practice (2011 est.) 
|Bahá'í 0.2%, Christian 31.6%, Muslim 62.7%, Atheist 0.5%, Agnostic 5.0% 
|According to the 2011 census, the population is 2.8 million. It is difficult to assess the size of religious groups because nearly 20 percent of respondents declined to answer the optional census question about religious affiliation. Several religious leaders challenge the census results. According to the census, Sunni Muslims constitute nearly 57 percent of the population, Roman Catholics 10 percent, Orthodox Christians (the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania) nearly 7 percent, and Bektashi (a form of Shia Sufism) 2 percent. Other groups present include Bahá'ís, Jehovah's Witnesses, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The State Committee on Cults reports more than 230 religious groups, organizations, foundations, and educational institutions operating in the country.

|[[Algeria]]
|Population 35,470,000, Christian 0.2%, Muslim 97.9%, Unaffiliated 1.8%
|Muslim (official; predominantly Sunni) 99%, other (includes Christian and Jewish) &lt;1% (2012 est.) 
|Christian 0.2%, Muslim 98.5%, Agnostic 1.2%
|The population is 37.1 million according to January estimates from the Office of National Statistics. Over 99 percent is Sunni Muslim. Groups together constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Christians, Jews, and a small community of [[Ibadi]] Muslims residing in the province of Ghardaia. Some religious leaders estimate there are only a few hundred Jews. Unofficial estimates of the number of Christians in Algeria vary between 30,000 and 70,000. For security reasons, due mainly to civil conflict, Christians concentrated in the cities of Algiers, Annaba, and Oran in the mid-1990s. According to Christian leaders, evangelical Christians, including Seventh-day Adventists, account for the largest number of Christians. Most evangelicals live in the Kabylie region. Next in size are the Methodists and members of other Protestant denominations, followed by Roman Catholics. A significant proportion of Christian foreign residents, whose numbers are difficult to estimate, are students and illegal immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa seeking to reach Europe. One religious leader estimates there are between 1,000 and 1,500 Egyptian Coptic Christians living in the country. There are no statistics on the number of religious conversions; however, according to the Minister of Religious Affairs, 150 foreigners converted to Islam and 50 citizens converted to Christianity in 2011. Christian leaders estimate that dozens of Algerians have converted to Christianity in the past two years. Officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Endowments (MRA) report that there are approximately 16,000 mosques and 24,000 imams in Algeria.

|The government estimates the population to be 78,000. There are no official statistics on religious affiliation, but observers estimate that approximately 90 percent of the population is Roman Catholic. Smaller religious groups include Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Anglicans, Seventh-day Adventists, Bahá'ís, and members of the Unification Church. There are also small numbers of members of other Christian groups, including the New Apostolic Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and Jehovah's Witnesses.
The population consists largely of immigrants from Spain, Portugal, and France; citizens constitute 37 percent of inhabitants. Immigrants are generally also Catholic.

|Christian 93.3%, Ethnoreligionist 4.6%, Muslim 1.1%, Atheist 0.2%, Agnostic 0.8%
|The government estimates the population to be approximately 20 million. The last official census was in 1970. The majority of the population is Christian. The Roman Catholic Church estimates that 55 percent of the population is Catholic, while the government estimates that 70 percent is. The National Institute for Religious Affairs estimates 25 percent of the population combines Christian and traditional beliefs; 10 percent is Protestant, including Methodists, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Congregationalists (United Church of Christ), and Assemblies of God; and 5 percent belongs to Brazilian evangelical churches. A small portion of the rural population practices animism or indigenous religious beliefs. There is a small Muslim community, unofficially estimated at 80,000 to 90,000, most of whom are migrants from West Africa or of Lebanese origin. Some Muslim sources put these figures closer to 500,000, but it is not possible to confirm the estimate.
There are approximately 450 to 500 Jews, primarily Israelis.

|According to a U.S. government estimate in July, the population of Antigua and Barbuda is 89,000. According to the 2001 census, 74 percent of the population is Christian. The Anglican Church is the largest religious group, accounting for 26 percent of the population. The Methodist, Moravian, and Roman Catholic churches account for less than 10 percent each. The United Evangelical Association, an organization that includes most independent evangelical churches, claims 25 percent of the population, and Jehovah's Witnesses number more than 1,000 members. Non-Christians include an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 Rastafarians, more than 200 Muslims, nearly 200 Hindus, and approximately 50 members of the Bahá'í Faith. There are also approximately 200 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

A 2008 study by the National Council of Scientific and Technical Research and the National Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology estimates Roman Catholics constitute 76 percent of the population, and Baptists, Jews, Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses, Lutherans, Methodists, and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) each total less than 5 percent of the population. Leaders of diverse religious groups note the recent growth of evangelical Protestant communities. While exact numbers are difficult to confirm (and national census data does not track religious affiliation), the Jewish population is approximately 250,000-300,000, generally considered the largest Jewish population in Latin America. Similarly, the Muslim population, an estimated 400,000 to 1 million, is also the largest in Latin America.

|Christian 93.5%, Muslim 0.2%, Neoreligionists 1.4%, Atheist 1.0%, Agnostic 3.8%
|According to preliminary results of the 2011 census, the population is 2.8 million. Approximately 90 percent of citizens belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. Other religious groups constituting less than 5 percent each of the total population include Roman Catholics, Armenian Uniate (Mekhitarist) Catholics, Orthodox Christians, evangelical Christians, Molokans, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, Baptists, charismatic Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Yezidis, Jews, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims, and pagans.
Yezidis are concentrated primarily in agricultural areas northwest of Yerevan around Mount Aragats, and Armenian Catholics live primarily in the north. Most Jews, Mormons, and Orthodox Christians reside in Yerevan, along with a small community of Muslims, most of whom are Shiites, including Iranians and temporary residents from the Middle East.

Hindu temples exist in southern areas. Christians are reportedly concentrated in towns and in the south.
According to unconfirmed estimates, there are between 3,000 and 15,000 Christians in the country. There are also reports of a few Muslims. Although priests of the animist Bon tradition often officiate at and include Bon rituals in Buddhist festivals, very few citizens adhere exclusively to this religion. The Sharchops ethnic group, which forms the majority of the population of eastern Bhutan, reportedly practices Tibetan Buddhism combined with elements of the Bon tradition and Hinduism.
According to an April estimate by the Ministry of Labor and Resources, just over 55,000 Indian laborers are present in the country, most of whom are Hindu or Muslim.

|The population is 3.8 million, according to a June 2011 government statistics agency estimate. The country's territory is divided into two entities, the Federation and the RS, with a separate administrative district for Brcko. According to unofficial estimates from the statistics agency, Muslims constitute 45 percent of the population, Serbian Orthodox Christians 36 percent, Roman Catholics 15 percent, Protestants 1 percent, and other communities, including Jews, 3 percent. There is a strong correlation between ethnicity and religion: Bosniaks are generally associated with Islam, Bosnian Serbs with the Serbian Orthodox Church, and Bosnian Croats with the Roman Catholic Church. The Jewish community has approximately 1,000 members and maintains an historic place in society by virtue of centuries of coexistence with other religious communities and its active role in the Inter-Religious Council, which mediates among the four religious communities regarded as "traditional" (Muslim, Serbian Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish).
The majority of Serbian Orthodox adherents live in the RS, and the majority of Muslims and Catholics in the Federation. Within the Federation distinct, Muslim and Catholic majority areas remain, with most Catholics in Herzegovina and areas of central Bosnia and most Muslims elsewhere in central Bosnia and Sarajevo. The Jewish community, similar to Protestants and most other small religious communities, has its largest membership in Sarajevo.

Groups together constituting about 2 percent of the population include Catholics, Armenian Christians, Jews, evangelical Protestants, and others. There are 115 registered religious groups in addition to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (BOC).
Some religious minorities are concentrated geographically. Many Muslims, including ethnic Turks, Roma, and "Pomaks" (descendants of Slavic Bulgarians who converted to Islam under Ottoman rule) live in the Rhodope Mountains along the southern border with Greece. Ethnic Turkish and Roma Muslims also live in large numbers in the northeast and along the Black Sea coast. Nearly 40 percent of Catholics live in and around Plovdiv. The majority of the small Jewish community lives in Sofia and along the Black Sea coast. Protestants are widely dispersed, but are more numerous in areas with large Roma populations.

Approximately 19 percent is Roman Catholic, 4 percent belongs to various Protestant groups, and 15 percent maintain exclusively indigenous beliefs. Statistics on religious affiliation are approximate because Muslims and Christians often adhere simultaneously to some aspects of indigenous religious beliefs.
Muslims reside largely in the northern, eastern, and western border regions, and Christians live in the center of the country. Persons practice indigenous religious beliefs throughout the country, especially in rural communities. The capital has a mixed Muslim and Christian population.

|Although there has not been a census since 1983, a 2012 U.S. government source estimates the population to be 54,584,700. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion. The principal minority religious groups include Christians (primarily Baptists, Roman Catholics, and Anglicans, along with several other small Protestant denominations), Muslims (mostly Sunni), Hindus, and practitioners of traditional Chinese and indigenous religions. Some sources suggest that approximately 90 percent of the population practices Buddhism, 4 percent Christianity, and 4 percent Islam. These statistics likely underestimate the non-Buddhist proportion of the population. A very small Jewish community in Rangoon has a synagogue but no resident rabbi.
The country is ethnically diverse, with significant correlation between ethnicity and religion. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion among the majority Burman ethnic group and also among the Shan, Rakhine, and Mon ethnic minorities. Christianity is dominant among the Kachin, Chin, and Naga ethnic groups. Christianity also is practiced widely among the Karen and Karenni ethnic groups; although many Karen and Karenni are Buddhist and some Karen are Muslim. Citizens of South Asian origin, who are concentrated in major cities and in the south-central region, are predominantly Hindu or Muslim, although some are Christian. Islam is practiced widely in Rakhine State and in Rangoon, Irrawaddy, Magwe, and Mandalay Divisions, where some Burmese, ethnic Indians, ethnic Bengalis, ethnic Kaman, and Rohingya practice the religion. Chinese ethnic minorities generally practice traditional Chinese religions. Traditional indigenous beliefs are practiced widely among smaller ethnic groups in the highland regions.

|According to Bureau of Statistics information as of 1 November 2010, the population of mainland China is 1,339,725,000. In its report to the United Nations Human Rights Council during its Universal Periodic Review in February 2009, the government stated that there were "more than 100 million followers of different religious faiths and the religious population is steadily increasing." However, accurate estimates of the numbers of religious believers vary widely depending on the source. For example, a 2007 survey conducted by East China Normal University states that 31.4 percent of citizens aged 16 and over, or 300 million people, are religious believers. The same survey estimates that there are 200 million Buddhists, Taoists, or worshippers of folk gods, although accurate estimates are difficult to make because many adherents practice exclusively at home.
According to the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA), there are more than 21 million Muslims in the country; unofficial estimates range as high as 50 million. Hui Muslims are concentrated primarily in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Qinghai, Gansu, and Yunnan provinces. Uighur Muslims live primarily in Xinjiang. According to Xinjiang Statistics Bureau data from 2010, there are approximately 10 million Uighurs in Xinjiang.
The 2011 Blue Book of Religions, produced by the Institute of World Religions at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a research institution directly under the State Council, reports the number of Protestant Christians to be between 23 and 40 million. A June 2010 SARA report estimates there are 16 million Protestants affiliated with the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM). According to 2010 Pew Research Center estimates, there are 67 million Protestant Christians, of whom 23 million are affiliated with the TSPM.
According to SARA, more than six million Catholics worship in sites registered by the Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA). The Pew Center estimates that there are nine million Catholics on the mainland, 5.7 million of whom are affiliated with the CPA.
In addition to the five nationally recognized religions, local governments have legalized certain religious communities and practices, such as Orthodox Christianity in Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. Some ethnic minorities retain traditional religions, such as Dongba among the Naxi people in Yunnan and Buluotuo among the Zhuang in Guangxi. Worship of the folk deity Mazu reportedly has been reclassified as "cultural heritage" rather than religious practice.
Prior to the government's 1999 ban on Falun Gong, a self-described spiritual discipline, it was estimated that there were 70 million adherents.

||According to official data from China's sixth decennial national census, conducted in November 2010, the TAR's 2,716,400 ethnic Tibetans make up 91 percent of the TAR's total population. Official census data also show ethnic Tibetans constituting 1.8 percent of the total population of Gansu Province, 24.4 percent in Qinghai Province, 2.1 percent in Sichuan Province, and 0.3 percent in Yunnan Province.
Most ethnic Tibetans practice Tibetan Buddhism, although a sizeable minority practices Bon, an indigenous religion, and very small minorities practice Islam, Catholicism, or Protestantism. Some scholars estimate that there are as many as 400,000 Bon followers across the Tibetan Plateau. Scholars also estimate that there are up to 5,000 ethnic Tibetan Muslims and 700 ethnic Tibetan Catholics in the TAR.
Many Tibetan government officials and CCP members in Tibet are religious believers, despite government and CCP prohibitions against officials’ holding religious beliefs or participating in religious activities.
Other residents of traditionally Tibetan areas include ethnic Han Chinese, many of whom practice Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, or traditional folk religions; Hui Muslims; and non-ethnic Tibetan Catholics and Protestants. Approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Muslims worship at mosques in the TAR. A Catholic church with 560 members is located in the traditionally Catholic community of Yanjing in the eastern TAR. Cizhong (Tsodruk), in Diqing (Dechen) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP), Yunnan Province, is also home to a large Tibetan Catholic congregation. The TAR is home to a small number of Falun Gong adherents, as well as unregistered Christian churches.
According to the State Council Information Office's 2011 White Paper "Sixty Years Since Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," the TAR has over 1,700 "venues for religious activities and about 46,000 monks and nuns." While no recent data on the number of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in other Tibetan areas of China are available, according to a 2009 article in the People's Daily (the official newspaper of the CCP), altogether in the TAR and in Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces, there are 3,000 Tibetan Buddhist monasteries with 120,000 Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns.

|The population is 47 million, according to a 2011 World Bank estimate. The government does not keep statistics on religious affiliation, and estimates from religious leaders varied. The Roman Catholic Bishops’ Conference estimates that 90 percent of the population is Catholic, while the Colombian Evangelical Council (CEDECOL) states that approximately 15 percent of the population is Protestant. According to a 2007 press report, 80 percent of the population is Catholic, 14 percent is non-Catholic Christian, 2 percent is agnostic, and the remaining 4 percent belongs to other religious groups, including Islam and Judaism. Other observers estimate that the non-Catholic population consists of five million members of Protestant, including evangelical, groups; 261,000 Seventh-day Adventists; 150,000 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church); 10,000 Muslims, and 5,000 Jews. There is also a small population of adherents to animism and various syncretic beliefs.
Some religious groups are concentrated in certain geographical regions. Most of those who blend Catholicism with elements of African animism are Afro-Colombians and reside on the Pacific coast. Most Jews reside in major cities, most Muslims on the Caribbean coast, and most adherents of indigenous animistic religions in remote rural areas. A small Taoist commune is located in a mountainous region of Santander Department.

There is no independent authoritative source on the size or composition of religious groups. The Roman Catholic Church estimates that 60 to 70 percent of the population is Catholic, but only 4 to 5 percent regularly attend mass. Membership in Protestant churches is estimated at 5 percent of the population. Baptists and Pentecostals are likely the largest Protestant denominations. Jehovah's Witnesses report approximately 95,400 members; Methodists estimate 35,000; Seventh-day Adventists 33,000; Anglicans, 22,000; Presbyterians, 15,000; Quakers, 300; and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), 50.

There are also syncretistic groups combining elements of Christianity and Islam with traditional beliefs. Zetahil, a practice unique to the country, combines elements of Christianity and Islam.
There is no significant link between ethnicity and religion, but geography is often associated with religious identity. The majority of Muslims reside in northern areas and in the urban centers of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tamale, and Wa, while the majority of the followers of traditional religious beliefs resides in rural areas. Christians live throughout the country.

Muslims constitute 99 percent of the population; 90 percent are Shia and 9 percent are Sunni (mostly Turkmen, Arabs, Baluchs, and Kurds living in the southwest, southeast, and northwest, respectively). There are no official statistics available on the size of the Sufi Muslim population; however, some reports estimate between two and five million people practice Sufism.
Groups together constituting the remaining 1 percent of the population include Bahá'ís, Christians, Jews, Sabean-Mandaeans, and Zoroastrians. The two largest non-Muslim minorities are Bahá'ís and Christians. The Bahá'ís number approximately 300,000, and are heavily concentrated in Tehran and Semnan. According to UN figures, 300,000 Christians live in the country, though some NGOs estimate there may be as many as 370,000. The Statistical Center of Iran reports there are 117,700. The majority of Christians are ethnic Armenians concentrated in Tehran and Isfahan. Unofficial estimates of the Assyrian Christian population range between 10,000 and 20,000. There are also Protestant denominations, including evangelical groups. Christian groups outside the country estimate the size of the Protestant Christian community to be less than 10,000, although many Protestant Christians reportedly practice in secret. There are from 5,000 to 10,000 Sabean-Mandaeans. The Statistical Center of Iran estimates there are 25,271 Zoroastrians, who are primarily ethnic Persians; however, Zoroastrian groups report they have 60,000 members.

note: while there has been voluntary relocation of many Christian families to northern Iraq, recent reporting indicates that the overall Christian population may have dropped by as much as 50 percent since the fall of the Saddam HUSSEIN regime in 2003, with many fleeing to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon (2010 est.) 
|Christian 1.5%, Muslim 97.5%, Neoreligionists 0.2%, Atheist 0.2%, Agnostic 0.5%
|According to a July 2012 U.S. government estimate, the population is approximately 31.1 million. Religious demography statistics vary due to violence, internal migration, and governmental tracking capability. Numbers are often estimates from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community leaders, as the government has not yet taken a census.
According to 2010 government statistics, 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Shia Muslims, predominantly Arabs but including Turkmen, Faili (Shia) Kurds, and others, constitute 60 to 65 percent. Arab and Kurdish Sunni Muslims make up 32 to 37 percent of the population. From 18 to 20 percent are Sunni Kurds, 12 to 16 percent are Sunni Arabs, and the remaining 1 to 2 percent are Sunni Turkmen. Approximately 3 percent of the population is composed of Christians, Yezidis, Sabean-Mandaeans, Bahá'ís, Shabaks, Kakais (sometimes referred to as Ahl-e Haqq), and a very small number of Jews. Shia, although predominantly located in the south and east, are the majority in Baghdad and have communities in most parts of the country. Sunnis form the majority in the west, center, and the north of the country.
Christian leaders estimate there are between 400,000 and 850,000 Christians. Approximately two-thirds are Chaldeans (an eastern rite of the Catholic Church), nearly one-fifth are Assyrians (Church of the East), and the remainder are Syriacs (Eastern Orthodox), Armenians (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox), Anglicans, and other Protestants. Evangelical Christians reportedly number approximately 5,000.
Yezidi leaders report that most of 500,000 to 700,000 Yezidis reside in the north, with 15 percent in Dahuk Province and the rest in Ninewa Province. Shabak leaders state there are 200,000 to 500,000 Shabaks, who reside mainly near Mosul in Ninewa Province. Estimates of the size of the Sabean-Mandaean community vary widely; according to Sabean-Mandaean leaders, about 4,000 remain in the country, generally along the Tigris and its tributaries. According to a leader in the Sabean-Mandaean community in Basrah, the Sabean-Mandaean population in Basrah has fallen dramatically over the last decade to an estimated 500-750 people. The Bahá'í leadership report fewer than 2,000 members, spread throughout the country in small groups. The Kakai community around Kirkuk is estimated at 24,500 people. Fewer than 10 Jews reportedly reside in Baghdad, and there are unconfirmed reports that very small Jewish communities exist in other parts of the country.
UNHCR reports that 82,260 Iraqi refugees and 218,800 internally displaced persons (IDPs) registered returns in 2012. The Ministry of Migration and Displacement (MOMD) reports that 304 of those returns were minorities. A majority of these refugees originally fled Iraq and sought asylum in Syria and Jordan due to sectarian violence triggered by the 2006 bombing of the Samara shrine. According to UNHCR's 2012 monitoring report, the majority of the Iraqi refugees who sought asylum in Iran were Shia families who had fled Iraq before 2003; those who returned in 2012 mostly settled in Najaf and Karbala.
In addition to Iraqi refugees, an estimated 1.1 million people of diverse religious backgrounds remain internally displaced due to sectarian violence between 2006 and 2008. The number of religious minorities internally displaced by violence remains uncertain because many stay with relatives and friends. An international NGO reports that 6,156 Christian families remain internally displaced in the country's northern governorates. The NGO largely attributes the high number to Iraqi Christians fleeing Syria where they had previously found refuge. The NGO attributes the decision of families to resettle in northern Iraq due to the area's relative security compared with elsewhere in the country. Humanitarian organizations working with displaced Christian families note that this vulnerable population is often unable to sell their homes at a reasonable price if they choose to migrate. They also face increasing rental costs in their area of displacement.

|According to the 2011 report of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the population is 7.9 million (including settlers living in the Occupied Territories), of which approximately 76 percent are Jews, 19 percent are Muslims, 2 percent are Christians, and 1.6 percent are Druze. The remaining 1.4 percent consists of relatively small communities of Bahá'ís, Samaritans, Karaites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and those classified as "other"—mostly persons who identify themselves as Jewish but do not satisfy the Orthodox Jewish definition of "Jewish" the government uses for civil procedures. The majority of non-Jewish citizens are of Arab origin.
According to the CBS report, 9 percent of the Jewish population identifies as Haredi (also known as "ultra-Orthodox"), 10 percent identifies as Orthodox, 15 percent describe themselves as "traditional, religious," 23 percent call themselves "traditional, not so religious," and 43 percent describe themselves as "nonreligious/secular" Jews, most of whom observe some Jewish traditions. Although not differentiated in official statistics, a 2012 Guttman Institute poll shows that approximately 500,000 traditional and secular Jews associate themselves with the beliefs of the Conservative or Reform streams of Judaism. There is also a community of approximately 20,000 Messianic Jews.
Religious communities often are concentrated in geographical areas according to religious beliefs. The country continues to undergo demographic changes due to the higher birth rate of the Haredi and Muslim communities.
There are approximately 95,000 foreigners permitted to work in the country and an additional 120,000 illegal foreign workers. Foreign workers were members of many different religious groups, including: Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim.

|Christian 80.7%, Hindu 0.1%, Muslim 2.5%, Atheist 3.6%, Agnostic 12.9%
|According to a 2011 national statistics institute estimate, the population is 60.63 million. A 2009 report estimates 87 percent of native-born citizens are Roman Catholic, but a 2010 report by the independent research institute Eurispes estimates that only 24 percent regularly participate in Catholic worship services. Religious groups accounting for less than 5 percent of the population include non-Catholic Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Bahá'ís, and Buddhists. Non-Catholic Christian groups include Orthodox, Jehovah's Witnesses, Assemblies of God, the Confederation of Methodist and Waldensian Churches, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and a number of small Protestant groups.
The number of Muslims continues to grow with immigration from North Africa, South Asia, Albania, and the Middle East. Most Muslims live in the northern part of the country. According to the research branch of the Caritas nongovernmental organization (NGO), of an estimated five million resident foreigners, 1.6 million are Muslim, 1.5 million Orthodox, one million Catholic, and 0.2 million Protestant. The Jewish community is estimated to be 30,000.

Approximately 35 to 40 percent is Muslim, a roughly equal percentage is Christian, and an estimated 25 percent adheres to indigenous religious beliefs. Many Christians and Muslims also adhere to some aspects of indigenous religious beliefs.
Traditionally, the north is associated with Islam and the south with Christianity, although practitioners of both religions live throughout the country. In general, political and religious affiliations tend to follow ethnic lines.
Christian groups include Roman Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Harrists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Southern Baptists, Copts, and members of the Assemblies of God.
Other religious groups include Buddhists, Bahá'ís, adherents of the Celestial Church of Christ, followers of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and Bossonists, who follow traditions of the Akan ethnic group.

|Buddhist 56.4%, Chinese Universalist 0.2%, Christian 2.1%, Muslim 0.2%, Shintoist 2.1%, Neoreligionists 25.9%, Atheist 2.9%, Agnostic 10.2%
|The Statistics Bureau estimates the population to be 127.5 million as of October. Because the government does not require religious groups to report their membership, it is difficult to determine the number of members of different groups. A 2009 report by the Agency for Cultural Affairs (ACA) indicates that membership claims by religious groups totaled 207 million. This number, substantially more than the country's population, reflects many citizens’ affiliation with multiple religions. For example, it is common to practice both Buddhist and Shinto rites.
According to the ACA's 2009 statistics, 106 million persons identified themselves as Shinto, 90 million as Buddhist, and 2.1 million as Christian, while nine million followed "other" religions. The category of "other" includes Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Judaism, or no religion. The government does not compile statistics on the number of Muslims in the country specifically, but a 2005 report by academic sources estimates the Muslim population at 63,000.
There is no significant correlation between religious affiliation and ethnicity, politics, or socio-economic status; the society is relatively ethnically and religiously homogeneous. The indigenous Ainu people, who practice an animist faith, are concentrated mainly in Japan's northern island, Hokkaido. Some immigrants and foreign workers practice religions other than Shintoism, the indigenous religion, or Buddhism.

Officially recognized Christian denominations include the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic (Melkite), Armenian Orthodox, Maronite Catholic, Assyrian, Coptic, Anglican, Lutheran, Seventh-day Adventist, and Presbyterian churches. Christian churches that are not officially recognized but registered as "societies" include the Free Evangelical Church, Nazarene Church, Assemblies of God, Christian and Missionary Alliance, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Unrecognized Christian denominations not registered as "societies" include the United Pentecostal Church and Jehovah's Witnesses. The government refers to Chaldean and Syriac Christians among the Iraqi refugee population as "guests." The Baptist Church is registered as a "denomination," but does not enjoy the full privileges of other registered religious groups in the country. The government does not recognize the Bahá'í Faith as a religion.

|According to U.S. government sources, the population is estimated at 24.6 million. In a 2002 report to the UN Human Rights Commission, the country's government reports there are 12,000 Protestants, 10,000 Buddhists, and 800 Roman Catholics. The report also notes that the Cheondogyo Young Friends Party, a government-approved group based on a traditional religious movement, has approximately 15,000 members. South Korean and other foreign religious groups estimate there is a considerably higher number of religious practitioners in the country.
In Pyongyang there are four state-controlled Christian churches: two Protestant churches (Bongsu and Chilgol Churches), the Changchun Roman Catholic Church, and the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church. The Chilgol Church is dedicated to the memory of former leader Kim Il-Sung's mother, Kang Pan-sok, who was a Presbyterian deaconess. The number of regular worshippers at these churches is unknown. Defectors from outside of Pyongyang have no knowledge of these churches.
As part of its 2009 Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the government reports the existence of religious organizations such as the Korea Christian Federation, Korea Buddhists’ Federation, Korea Roman Catholic Association, Korea Chondoist Society, and Korea Religionists’ Society.
The government-established Korean Catholic Association (KCA) provides for basic services at the Changchun Church, but has no ties with the Vatican. There are no Catholic priests residing in the country. Visiting priests occasionally provide Mass at the Changchun Church.
According to religious leaders who have traveled to the country, there are Protestant pastors at the Bongsu and Chilgol Churches, although it is not known whether they are resident or visiting pastors.
In its July 2002 report to the UN Human Rights Committee, the government reports the existence of 500 "family worship centers." However, according to the 2012 Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU) White Paper, defectors were unaware of any such centers. Observers stated that "family worship centers" may be part of the state-controlled Korean Christian Federation, while an unknown number of "underground churches" operate apart from the federation and are not recognized by the government. The 2012 KINU White Paper and the 2007 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report, "A Prison Without Bars," include defector testimonies referencing the existence of underground churches, but conclude that their existence was hard to verify.
In July 2009 the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported an estimated 30,000 Christians, while some NGOs and academics estimate there may be up to several hundred thousand "underground" Christians. Others question the existence of a large-scale underground church or conclude that it is impossible to estimate accurately the number of underground religious believers. Individual underground congregations are reportedly very small and typically confined to private homes.
According to the 2012 KINU White Paper, there are an estimated 60 Buddhist temples. Most are regarded as cultural relics, but religious activity is permitted in some. Monks serve as caretakers in many of these temples and foreign visitors find these monks to be knowledgeable about Buddhism. Based on defector testimony, the 2012 KINU White Paper reports that most residents of the country have not heard about Buddhist scriptures and have never seen a Buddhist monk. State-controlled press reported on several occasions that Buddhist ceremonies took place in various locations.
The Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church opened in Pyongyang in 2006.

|According to official government census data released in October, the population is 1.74 million. Census data shows 95.6 percent of the population identifies as Muslim, 2.2 percent as Roman Catholic, and 1.4 percent as Serbian Orthodox. Census categories for "Other," "None," or "No Response" each constitute less than 1 percent. The largest Catholic communities live in Gjakove/Djakovica, Kline/Klina, Prizren, Janjevo, and Pristina. Most members of the SOC reside in ethnically Serb towns and enclaves. Small populations of Protestants live in most cities, with the largest concentration located in Pristina. The largest Jewish community resides in Prizren. The Kosovo Islamic Community is the officially recognized Islamic umbrella group and is known by its Albanian-language acronym BIK; it is responsible for training Muslim clergy and appointing them to mosques throughout the country.
Religion and ethnicity are closely linked; Serbs generally belong to the SOC, while the majority of religiously active citizens of Albanian descent identify themselves as Muslim.
Critics of the census note it does not include residents in the northern region of Mitrovice/Mitrovica and thus significantly under-represents Serbs who belong to the SOC. Anecdotal information also suggests census takers at times automatically assigned Islam to persons without soliciting explicit answers or over their verbal objections.

Estimates derived from voting records and personal status documents indicate that approximately 70 percent of citizens, including the ruling family, adhere to the Sunni branch of Islam. Most of the remaining 30 percent of citizens are Shia Muslims. There are approximately 150-200 Christian citizens and a small number of Bahá'í citizens. An estimated 150,000 noncitizen residents are Shia. While some areas have relatively high concentrations of either Sunnis or Shia, most areas are religiously well integrated.
There are an estimated 600,000 non-citizen Hindus. The largely non-citizen Christian population is estimated to be more than 450,000. The government-recognized Christian churches include the Roman Catholic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the National Evangelical (Protestant) Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, the Greek Orthodox Church (referred to in Arabic as the Roman Orthodox Church), the Greek Catholic (Melkite) Church, and the Anglican Church.

The remainder of the population belongs to at least 48 distinct ethnic minority groups, most of which practice animism and ancestor worship. Animism is predominant among Sino-Thai groups, such as the Thai Dam and Thai Daeng, as well as among Mon-Khmer and Burmo-Tibetan groups. Even among lowland Lao, many pre-Buddhist animist beliefs are incorporated into Theravada Buddhist practice, particularly in rural areas. Roman Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Bahá'ís, Mahayana Buddhists, and followers of Confucianism constitute less than 3 percent of the population.

|According to the Beirut-based research firm Statistics Lebanon, the population is approximately 4.3 million. An estimated 27 percent is Sunni Muslim, 27 percent Shia Muslim, 21 percent Maronite Christian, 8 percent Greek Orthodox, 5.6 percent Druze, and 5 percent Greek Catholic, with the remaining 6.5 percent belonging to smaller Christian groups. There are also very small numbers of Jews, Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Hindus, and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
The 18 officially recognized religious groups include four Muslim groups, 12 Christian groups, the Druze, and Judaism. The main branches of Islam practiced are Shia and Sunni. The Alawites and the Ismaili ("Sevener") Shia order are the smallest Muslim communities. The Maronite community, the largest Christian group, maintains its centuries-long affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church but has its own patriarch, liturgy, and ecclesiastical customs. The second-largest Christian sect is Greek Orthodox. Other Christians are divided among Greek Catholics, Armenian Orthodox (Gregorians), Armenian Catholics, Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites), Syriac Catholics, Assyrians (Nestorians), Chaldeans, Copts, evangelicals (including Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists), and Latins (Roman Catholic). The Druze, who refer to themselves as al-Muwahhideen, or "believers in one God," are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas east and south of Beirut.
Many persons fleeing religious mistreatment and discrimination in neighboring states are immigrants in the country, including Kurds, Shia, and Chaldeans from Iraq, as well as Coptic Christians from Egypt and Sudan. According to the secretary-general of the Syriac League, approximately 10,000 Iraqi Christians and 3,000 to 4,000 Coptic Christians reside in the country.

|A U.S. government source estimates the population is 3.9 million. According to the 2008 National Population and Housing Census, the population is 85.6 percent Christian, 12.2 percent Muslim, 0.6 percent adherents of indigenous religious beliefs, 1.5 percent persons who claim no religion, and less than 1 percent members of other religious groups, including Bahá'ís, Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists. The estimated percentage of the Muslim population is a source of contention. Unofficial reports and surveys estimate Muslims constitute between 10 and 20 percent of the population. Many members of religious groups incorporate elements of indigenous beliefs into their religious practices. Christian groups include Lutherans, Baptists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Seventh-Day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and members of the United Methodist, African Methodist Episcopal (AME), AME Zion, and a variety of Pentecostal churches.
Christians reside throughout the country. Muslims belong mainly to the Mandingo ethnic group, which resides throughout the country, and the Vai ethnic group, which lives predominantly in the west. There is also a predominantly Muslim Fula community throughout the country. The Fula people are referred to as a community not by location, but as a tribal segment of society. Ethnic groups in most regions participate in the indigenous religious practices of secret societies.

Roman Catholic clergy are present in larger cities, working primarily in hospitals, orphanages, and with the elderly or physically impaired. A priest in Tripoli and a bishop resident in Tunis lead the Anglican community. A Greek Orthodox archbishop in Tripoli and priests in Tripoli and Benghazi serve approximately 80 regular Orthodox churchgoers. The Ukrainian embassy in Tripoli also maintains a small Orthodox church for Tripoli's Russian-speaking population. There are nondenominational, evangelical Unity churches in Tripoli and Benghazi, as well as small Unity congregations located throughout the country. Nondenominational churches in Tripoli serve primarily African and Filipino migrant workers. The overwhelming majority of Libya's Jewish population, estimated at 40,000, fled the country between 1948 and 1967. David Gerbi, a Libyan Jew active in the exiled Jewish community in Italy, estimates that there are around 200,000 Libyan Jews and their descendants living outside of the country. While there are reports of some Jews remaining, there are no known estimates of the current population. Representatives from the Jewish diaspora are unable to return to reopen the synagogue in Tripoli due to security concerns.
There are no known places of worship for members of other non-Muslim religious groups, although adherents are allowed to practice their religion in their homes.

|The country's population is 32.3 million, according to U.S. government estimates. More than 99 percent is Sunni Muslim. Groups together constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Christians, Jews, Shia Muslims, and Bahá'ís. According to Jewish community leaders, there are an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Jews, approximately 2,500 of whom reside in Casablanca and are the remnants of a much larger community that has mostly emigrated. The Rabat and Marrakesh Jewish communities each have about 100 members. The remainder of the Jewish population is dispersed throughout the country. That population is mostly elderly.
The predominantly Roman Catholic and Protestant foreign resident Christian community consists of approximately 5,000 practicing members, although some Protestant and Catholic clergy estimate the number to be as high as 25,000. Most foreign resident Christians live in the Casablanca, Tangier, and Rabat urban areas. Various local Christian leaders estimate that there are 4,000 citizen Christians (mostly ethnic Amazigh) who regularly attend "house" churches and live predominantly in the south. Some Christian leaders estimate that there may be as many as 8,000 Christian citizens throughout the country, but many reportedly do not meet regularly due to fear of government surveillance and social persecution.
The Catholic and French Protestant (referred to as l’Eglise evangelique du Maroc, or EEM) churches have buildings throughout many cities in the country. There are two Anglican churches located in Casablanca and Tangier. The Russian Orthodox Church holds services in a building in Rabat. The Greek Orthodox Church owns a building in Casablanca where it holds services. The Association Marocaine des Eglises Protestantes (AMEP) churches, a network of autonomous foreign resident Protestant church communities, generally rent or share buildings.
There are an estimated 3,000 to 8,000 Shia Muslims, most of them foreign residents from Lebanon or Iraq but including a few citizens. Followers of several Sufi Muslim orders across the Maghreb and West Africa undertake joint annual pilgrimages to the country. There are 350-400 Bahá'ís, located in urban areas.

The 2007 census estimates that 28 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, 27 percent is Protestant, 18 percent is Muslim, 9 percent is divided among many small groups, and approximately 18 percent does not profess a religion or belief. Religious leaders speculate that a significant portion of the population adheres to syncretic indigenous religious beliefs, a category not included in the 2007 census. Muslim leaders state that their community accounts for closer to 25-30 percent of the population, a statistic frequently reported in the press. There are small numbers of Jews, Hindus, and Bahá'ís.
The South Asian immigrant population is predominantly Muslim, and there are some differences between their practices and the traditional, Sufi-inspired Swahili Islam of Muslims of African origin. An increasing number of African Muslim clerics travel to Egypt, Kuwait, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia for training, and some return with a more conservative approach to Islam.

The National Churches Fellowship of Nepal reported that more than 1,000 Christian churches operate in the country. Christian groups state that the number of Christians increased significantly over the past several years, as borne out by the community's nearly three-fold increase over the past decade, from 0.5 to 1.4 percent of the total population. According to a Jamia Masjid (mosque) official, there are at least 3,600 madrassahs, most of which are associated with a mosque.

Evangelical leaders discount these figures, claiming larger percentages of the population.
The Assemblies of God, Nicaragua's largest evangelical Pentecostal church, estimates its membership at 640,000. Evangelical leaders estimate evangelicals currently represent 43-46 percent of the population; they include Moravian Lutherans, Baptists, and other Protestants in that number.

|The 2011 census estimates the population to be 51.8 million. The census did not include statistics on religious demography. According to 2001 census figures, 80 percent of the population is Christian. Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, and adherents of traditional African beliefs together constitute slightly less than 5 percent of the population. Approximately 15 percent of the population adheres to no particular religion or declines to indicate an affiliation; some of these individuals probably adhere to unaffiliated indigenous religions. Many combine Christian and indigenous religious practices. The Church of Scientology has a small following.
The African Independent Churches constitute the largest group of Christian churches, including the Zion Christian Church (approximately 11 percent of the population), the Apostolic Church (approximately 10 percent), and a number of Pentecostal and charismatic groups. Other Christian groups include Methodists, Anglicans, Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, and members of the Greek Orthodox, Dutch Reformed, and Congregational churches.
Ethnic Indian/Asian South Africans account for 2.5 percent of the total population. Roughly half of the ethnic Indian population is Hindu, and the majority resides in KwaZulu-Natal. The small Muslim community includes Cape Malays of Malayan-Indonesian descent, individuals of Indian or Pakistani origin, and several thousand Somali and Ethiopian immigrants.
The small Jewish community is concentrated in Johannesburg and Cape Town.

|According to the 2008 census, the population is approximately 8 million. The majority is Christian. There are no reliable statistics on the Muslim or animist minorities. Studies from the 1980s and the early 2000s estimated that Muslims constituted between 18 and 35 percent of the population, but the number of Muslims has probably declined through migration to Sudan after South Sudanese independence in 2011. The acting general secretary of the Sudan Council of Churches, which continues to include churches in both Sudan and South Sudan, notes that the seven principal Christian groups are Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, Sudan Pentecostal, Sudan Interior, Presbyterian Evangelical, and the Inland African Church. A substantial part of the population in isolated parts of the country probably adheres to indigenous religious beliefs or combines Christian and indigenous practices.

|The population is approximately 26 million, according to the 2008 census. The Culture and Information Ministry estimates that 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Almost all Muslims are Sunni, although there are significant distinctions between followers of different Sunni traditions, particularly among Sufi orders. In addition, there are small Muslim minorities, including Shia and the Republican Brothers, based predominantly in Khartoum, and a growing, yet still small, percentage of Salafists.
The Culture and Information Ministry estimates that Christians make up 3 percent of the population. Christians primarily reside in Khartoum, the north, and the Nuba Mountains. It is unclear whether these numbers include residents of Southern Sudanese origin whose citizenship status remains under review. Khartoum's significant Christian population decreased with the migration of many Christians of southern heritage to South Sudan.
There are very small but long-established groups of Orthodox Christians in Khartoum and other cities, including Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox. There are also Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox communities, largely made up of refugees and migrants, in Khartoum and the east. Other smaller Christian groups include the Africa Inland Church, Armenian (Apostolic) Church, Sudan Church of Christ, Sudan Interior Church, Sudan Pentecostal Church, Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Presbyterian Church of the Sudan, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Anglicans, and Jehovah's Witnesses.
The Culture and Information Ministry indicates that less than 1 percent of the population adheres to African traditional religious beliefs. Some Christians and Muslims also adhere to some aspects of traditional beliefs.

|According to a 2011 World Bank estimate, the population is 530,000. Approximately 41 percent of the population is Christian, of which half are Roman Catholics, according to the 2004 census. A wide range of other groups, including Moravian, Lutheran, Dutch Reformed, evangelical Protestant, Baptist, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Jehovah's Witnesses, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), make up the remaining Christian population. Twenty percent of the population is Hindu, including the Sanathan Dharma and the Arya Dewaker. Muslims, including Sunni, Ahmadiyya, and the World Islamic Call Society, make up 13.5 percent. Approximately 3 percent adhere to indigenous religions. Bahá'ís, Jews, Buddhists, Brahma Kumaris, and Hare Krishnas are also present in small numbers. There are three Rastafarian organizations: Aya Bingi Order, 12th Tribe, and Bobo Shanti.
Some Amerindian and Maroon populations adhere to indigenous religions. Some Amerindians, concentrated principally in the interior and to a lesser extent in coastal areas, practice shamanism through a medicine man (piaiman). Many Maroons, who inhabit the interior, worship nature through a practice that has no special name. Other Maroons, as well as some Creoles in urban areas, worship their ancestors through a rite called wintie. Citizens of Amerindian and Maroon origin who identify as Christian often combine Christian practices with indigenous religious customs with the tacit approval of Christian leaders.
There is a correlation between ethnicity and religion. Many political parties have strong ethnic ties, and members tend to belong to the same religious group. With the exception of those following indigenous practices, religious groups are not concentrated in any particular region.

Membership in the Church of Sweden has decreased steadily since it separated from the state in 2000. Researchers estimate that approximately 6 percent of the population is Muslim.
According to the Official Council of Swedish Jewish Communities, the number of Jews is approximately 20,000. The Swedish Commission for Government Support to Faith Communities estimates there are 9,000 practicing Jews in the country. Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform synagogues are found mostly in large cities.

|According to the Federal Office of Statistics, the population is 8.01 million. The June update of the 2010 census estimates religious group membership as 38.6 percent Roman Catholic, 28 percent Protestant, 4.5 percent Muslim, and 1.8 percent Christian Orthodox. Over 20 percent self-identifies as atheist. Religious groups constituting less than 1 percent of the population include Old Catholics, other Christian denominations, Buddhists, Hindus, and Jews. Although actual church attendance rates are much lower, 80 percent report being religious, including 22 percent being very religious, in a 2007 Religion Monitor survey sponsored by the Bertelsmann Foundation.
Most immigrants are members of religious groups different from native-born citizens. Over 90 percent of Muslims are of foreign origin, with nearly 100 nationalities represented. Most come from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Albania, Turkey, and North Africa. The majority of the Muslim community is Sunni, interspersed with some Shia and Alawites. Most of the Muslim population lives in urban areas. Over 75 percent of Jewish households are located in Zurich, Geneva, Basel, and Bern.

|Christian 5.2%, Muslim 92.8%, Atheist 0.1%, Agnostic 1.9%
|According to a U.S. government source, the population is approximately 22.5 million, although emigration increased throughout the year due to ongoing violence, unrest, and economic hardship. Sunni Muslims constitute 74 percent of the population and are present throughout the country. The Sunni population includes Arabs, Kurds, Circassians, Chechens, and some Turkomans. Other Muslim groups, including Alawis, Ismailis, and Shia, together constitute 13 percent. Druze account for 3 percent of the population. Various Christian groups constitute the remaining 10 percent, although the Christian population may be closer to 8 percent due to emigration as Christians flee the country. There is also a small Jewish population in major urban areas.
Most Christians belong to the autonomous Orthodox churches, the Uniate churches (which recognize the Roman Catholic Pope), or the independent Nestorian Church. There is a Yezidi population of approximately 80,000, but the government does not recognize the Yezidi as belonging to a group distinct from Islam. Many of the approximately 100 Jews in the country at the beginning of the year have reportedly emigrated due to the ongoing conflict.
Most Christians live in and around Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and Latakia, or in the Hasaka governorate in the northeast section of the country. Iraqi Christians frequently migrated to Syria in past years, but very few entered during the year due to ongoing unrest and violence. The majority of the Iraqi Christian population in the country either moved to neighboring states or returned to Iraq. The majority of Alawis live in the mountainous areas of the coastal Latakia governorate, but they also have significant presence in the cities of Latakia, Tartous, Homs, and Damascus. Many Druze live in the rugged Jabal al-Arab region in the southern governorate of Suweida, where they constitute the vast majority of the local population. The few remaining Jews are concentrated in Damascus and Aleppo. Yezidis are found primarily in the northeast and Aleppo. The Kurdish population is located in the northern and eastern border areas with Turkey and Iraq, largely in Hassakeh, Raqqah, and Halab.

|According to Ministry of Interior figures from October, the population is 23,293,600. Based on a comprehensive study conducted in 2005, the Religious Affairs Section of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) estimates that 35 percent of the population considers itself to be Buddhist and 33 percent Taoist. Although MOI has not tracked data on religious adherence since the 2005 study, it states this estimate might still reflect the situation. MOI does not include religious adherence as a census question, as doing so would constitute an invasion of privacy according to the Personal Data Protection Law. While the overwhelming majority of religious adherents categorize themselves as either Buddhist or Taoist, many adherents consider themselves to be both Buddhist and Taoist.
In addition to organized religious groups, many persons also practice traditional Chinese folk religions, which include some aspects of shamanism, ancestor worship, and animism. Researchers and academics estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population believes in some form of traditional folk religion. Such folk religions may overlap with an individual's belief in Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, or other traditional Chinese religions. There also may be an overlap between practitioners of Buddhism, Taoism, and other traditional Chinese religions, and Falun Gong practitioners. Falun Gong is a self-described spiritual discipline that combines qigong (a traditional Chinese exercise discipline) with the teachings of founder Li Hongzhi. Falun Gong is registered as a civic rather than a religious organization. According to an academic source, Falun Gong membership exceeds one million and continues to grow.
Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include I Kuan Tao, Tien Ti Chiao (Heaven Emperor Religion), Tien Te Chiao (Heaven Virtue Religion), Li-ism, Hsuan Yuan Chiao (Yellow Emperor Religion), Tian Li Chiao (Tenrikyo), Universe Maitreya Emperor Religion, Hai Tze Tao, Zhonghua Sheng Chiao (Chinese Holy Religion), Da Yi Chiao (Great Changes Religion), Pre-cosmic Salvationism, Huang Chung Chiao (Yellow Middle Religion), Roman Catholicism, Islam, the Church of Scientology, the Bahá'í Faith, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mahikari Religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and the Unification Church, all of which are registered. Unregistered denominations include the Presbyterian, True Jesus, Baptist, Lutheran, Seventh-day Adventist, and Episcopal churches. The majority of the indigenous population of 507,000 aborigines is Protestant or Roman Catholic. Jews number approximately 130 persons, although they are predominantly foreign residents. Some 400,000 migrant workers, primarily from Southeast Asia, differ in religious adherence from the general population. The largest single group of migrant workers is from Indonesia, with a population of more than 200,000 persons who are largely Muslim. Migrant workers from the Philippines are predominantly Christian.

|The population is 7.7 million, according to a State Statistics Agency estimate from October 2011. According to local academics, the population is more than 90 percent Muslim. Active observance of Islam appears to be increasing steadily, especially among youth. The majority adhere to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam as traditionally practiced in Central Asia. Approximately 4 percent of Muslims are Ismaili Shia, the majority of whom reside in the remote eastern Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. The country has approximately 3,452 "five-time" prayer mosques and 357 "Friday prayer" mosques (larger facilities built for weekly prayers).
There are 75 registered non-Muslim religious groups. There are approximately 150,000 Christians. The largest Christian group is Russian Orthodox; there are also Baptists, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, Lutherans, and Korean Protestants. There are a small number of Bahá'ís, fewer than 300 Jews and approximately 700 Jehovah's Witnesses.

|The National Bureau of Statistics estimates the population is nearly 45 million. The government does not collect data on religious identification. The Interfaith Council (also known as the Inter-Religious Council for Peace Tanzania, a nongovernmental organization bringing together Christian, Muslim, Bahá'í, Hindu, and Buddhist leaders to foster peace and strengthen relationships) does not keep statistics on religious identity. Many religious groups are reluctant to estimate religious demographics, but most religious leaders estimate that the population is 50 percent Christian and 50 percent Muslim. A 2010 Pew Forum survey estimates that approximately 60 percent of the population is Christian, 36 percent Muslim, and 4 percent members of other religious groups.
On the mainland, large Muslim communities are concentrated in coastal areas, with some large Muslim minorities also located inland in urban areas. Zanzibar is approximately 98 percent Muslim. Between 80 and 90 percent of the Muslim population is Sunni. The remainder consists of several Shia subgroups, mostly of Asian descent. Christian groups include Roman Catholics, Protestants (including Pentecostals), Seventh-day Adventists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and Jehovah's Witnesses. Other religious groups include Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, and Bahá'ís.
The country's three largest political parties are secular, but include the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) party, often associated with Zanzibar's Muslim community, and the opposition Chama cha Mapinduzi na Maendeleo (Chadema) party, often associated with the Christian majority on the mainland.

|According to the 2010 census, the population of 66 million is 93 percent Buddhist and 5 percent Muslim. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and religious groups claim that 85 to 95 percent of the population is Theravada Buddhist and 5 to 10 percent is Muslim. Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include animist, Christian, Confucian, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, and Taoist populations.
Theravada Buddhism, the dominant religion, is not an exclusive belief system and most Buddhists also incorporate Brahmin-Hindu and animist practices. The Buddhist clergy (Sangha) consists of two main schools: Mahanikaya and Dhammayuttika. The former is older and more prevalent within the monastic community than the latter. The same ecclesiastical hierarchy governs both groups.
Islam is the dominant religion in four of the five southernmost provinces. The majority of Muslims in those provinces are ethnic Malay, but the Muslim population nationally also includes descendants of immigrants from South Asia, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and those who consider themselves ethnic Thai. The Ministry of Interior's Islamic Affairs Section reported that, as of October, 3,744 mosques are registered in 68 of the country's 77 provinces, of which 3,179 are located in the 14 southern provinces. According to the Religious Affairs Department (RAD) of the Ministry of Culture, 99 percent of these mosques are associated with the Sunni branch of Islam. Shia mosques make up 1 percent and are in Bangkok and the provinces of Nakhon Sithammarat, Krabi, and Phatthalung. There are 39 Provincial Islamic Committees nationwide.
The majority of ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese practice Mahayana or Theravada Buddhism. Many ethnic Chinese, as well as members of the Mien hill tribe, practice forms of Taoism.

The remaining 5 percent includes persons not affiliated with any religious group. Many Christians and Muslims continue to perform indigenous religious practices. Reliable figures are difficult to obtain because of migration and because the government does not collect religious and ethnic data.
Most Muslims live in the central and northern regions. Christians live mainly in the southern part of the country. The Muslim Union of Togo reports a large surge in immigrants from Muslim countries, but the government does not collect the statistics needed to confirm or deny that claim.

More than half of the population is at least nominally Buddhist, with 10 percent actively practicing Mahayana Buddhism (most of whom are of the majority ethnic group Kinh or Viet) and 1.2 percent actively practicing Theravada Buddhism (approximately one million members of the Khmer minority in the south). Roman Catholics constitute 7 percent of the population. Catholicism is growing, with over 6 million adherents worshiping in 26 dioceses across the country. Cao Dai, a religion combining elements of many religions, is practiced by 2.5 to 4 percent of the population. Hoa Hao followers constitute 1.5 to 3 percent of the population. Estimates of the number of Protestants range from 1 to 2 percent of the population. Some Protestant denominations are officially recognized at the national level; others are registered locally, but have not attained national recognition. Muslims number 70,000 to 80,000, or less than 0.1 percent of the population; approximately 40 percent of Muslims are Sunnis; the remaining 60 percent practice Bani Islam.
Smaller religious groups that together comprise less than 0.1 percent of the population include 50,000 ethnic Cham who mostly practice a devotional form of Hinduism in the south-central coastal area, an estimated 8,000 members of the Bahá'í Faith, and approximately 1,000 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) throughout the country. There is one Jewish synagogue in Ho Chi Minh City serving approximately 150 Jews, mainly foreign residents who live in the city.
Other citizens consider themselves nonreligious, or practice animism or the veneration of ancestors, tutelary and protective saints, national heroes and local, respected persons. Followers of these traditional forms of worship may or may not term themselves religious.
Ethnic minorities constitute approximately 14 percent of the population. Based on adherents’ estimates, two-thirds of Protestants are members of ethnic minorities, including minority groups in the Northwest Highlands (H’mong, Dzao, Thai, and others) and in the Central Highlands (Ede, Jarai, Sedang, and M’nong, among others). The Khmer Krom ethnic group overwhelmingly practices Theravada Buddhism.

There are reports of an increase in Muslims who adhere to Salafi-Sunni Islam, but statistics are unavailable to confirm these reports. There are a few thousand Ismaili Muslims concentrated in the Haraz district near Sanaa, an unknown number of Ithnasheria (Twelver) Shia who reside mainly in the north, and a significant but indeterminate number of Sufis. Groups comprising less than .05 percent of the population include Jews, Bahá'ís, Hindus, and Christians, many of whom are refugees or temporary foreign residents. Christian groups include Roman Catholics and Anglicans. The once-sizable Jewish community is the only indigenous non-Muslim minority religious group; the few Jews remaining after decades of emigration to Israel live mainly in Sanaa and the Rayda district in the Amran governorate.

|Preliminary findings from the 2012 national census estimate the population at 13 million, although it is likely lower because an estimated three to four million Zimbabweans currently live outside the country due to economic and political crises. According to the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ), 84 percent of the population is Christian. The EFZ's 2004 census estimates the Christian population is 33 percent Catholic; 42 percent evangelical or Pentecostal; 17 percent Anglican, Methodist, or Presbyterian, and 8 percent apostolic. There are a significant number of independent Pentecostal and syncretic African churches.
The majority of the population also adheres to indigenous religions. Religious leaders reported a continued increase in observance of indigenous religious practices, often simultaneously with Christianity. Approximately 14 percent of the population adheres solely to indigenous religious beliefs.
Approximately 3 percent of the population is Muslim, primarily immigrants of Mozambican and Malawian descent. The Muslim population is concentrated in rural areas and in some high-density suburbs. Small numbers of Greek Orthodox, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and Bahá'ís make up less than 1 percent of the population.
Political elites tend to be members of established Christian mainstream or Pentecostal churches. Some apostolic groups, along with the CPZ, support the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and are especially prevalent in ZANU-PF political strongholds.

'''Religious liberalism''' is a conception of [[religion]] (or of a particular religion) which emphasizes personal and group [[liberty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=144}}: "[...] when people talk about 'religious liberalism,' they are normally referring to a commitment to a certain kind of conception of what religion is and, accordingly, of how religious attitudes, institutions, and communities should be developed or reshaped so as to accommodate and promote particular forms of personal and group freedom."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=159}}: "[...] religious liberalism came to be so concerned with respect for reason, reasonableness, and rationality [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attitude towards one's own religion (as opposed to [[criticism of religion]] from a [[secular]] position, and as opposed to criticism of a religion other than one's own) which contrasts with a traditionalist or [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] approach, and it is directly opposed by trends of [[religious fundamentalism]]. It is related to [[religious liberty]], which is the tolerance of different religious beliefs and practices, but not all promoters of religious liberty are in favor of religious liberalism, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=143–144}}: "However, given the way in which terminology has evolved, we must be careful not to assume too close an association between 'religious liberty' and 'religious liberalism.' Many people who think that religious liberty is basically a good thing that ought to be promoted do not wish to be regarded as advocates of religious liberalism; some of them even feel that many of those who call themselves 'religious liberals' are enemies of religious liberty, or at least end up undermining religious liberty in the process of promoting their own special brand of 'liberal religion.' [...] One notable problem here is that, when liberalism is considered in relation to religion, one may be thinking primarily of a certain 'liberal' conception of religion itself (in contrast with, say, orthodox, conservative, traditionalist, or fundamentalist conceptions) or one may be thinking more of a 'liberal' political view of the value of religious liberty. But, when people talk about 'religious liberalism,' they are usually thinking of the former more than the latter, although they may uncritically assume that the two necessarily accompany one another."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
"Liberalism" in the context of religious liberalism conveys the sense of [[classical liberalism]] as it developed in the [[Enlightenment era]], which forms the starting point of both religious and political liberalism; but religious liberalism does not necessarily coincide with all meanings of "liberalism" in [[political philosophy]]. For example, an [[Empirical research|empirical]] attempt to show a link between religious liberalism and political liberalism proved inconclusive in a 1973 study in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stellway |first=Richard J. |date=Summer 1973 |title=The correspondence between religious orientation and socio‐political liberalism and conservatism |journal=[[The Sociological Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=430–439 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1973.tb00871.x |jstor=4105689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term "liberal" in the context of religious philosophy appeared as early as the mid-19th century&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; and became established by the first part of the 20th century; for example, in 1936, philosophy professor and [[Disciples of Christ]] minister Edward Scribner Ames wrote in his article "Liberalism in Religion":&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ames |first=Edward Scribner |date=July 1936 |title=Liberalism in religion |journal=[[International Journal of Ethics]] |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=429–443 |doi=10.1086/intejethi.46.4.2989282 |jstor=2989282 |url=https://digitalcommons.acu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1165&amp;context=crs_books}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|The term "liberalism" seems to be developing a religious usage which gives it growing significance. It is more sharply contrasted with fundamentalism, and signifies a far deeper meaning than modernism. Fundamentalism describes a relatively uncritical attitude. In it custom, traditionalism, and authoritarianism are dominant. [...] There is no doubt that the loss of the traditional faith has left many people confused and rudderless, and they are finding that there is no adequate satisfaction in mere excitement or in flight from their finer ideals. They crave a sense of deeper meaning and direction for their life. Religious liberalism, not as a cult but as an attitude and method, turns to the living realities in the actual tasks of building more significant individual and collective human life.}}

Religious traditionalists, who reject the idea that tenets of modernity should have any impact on religious tradition, challenge the concept of religious liberalism. Secularists, who reject the idea that implementation of rationalistic or critical thought leaves any room for religion altogether, likewise dispute religious liberalism.

"[[Liberal Christianity]]" is an umbrella term for the developments in Christian theology and culture since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the late 18th century. It has become mostly mainstream within the major [[Christian denominations]] in the [[Western world]], but is opposed by a movement of [[Christian fundamentalism]] which developed in response to these trends, and also contrasts with conservative forms of Christianity outside the Western world and outside the reach of Enlightenment philosophy and modernism, mostly within [[Eastern Christianity]].

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in particular has a long tradition of controversy regarding questions of religious liberalism. Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]] (1801–1890), for example, was seen{{by whom|date=October 2015}} as moderately liberal by 19th-century standards because he was critical of [[papal infallibility]], but he explicitly opposed "liberalism in religion" because he argued it would lead to complete [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Liberalism in religion is the doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion, but that one creed is as good as another…", JH Newman 'Biglietto Speech' http://www.newmanreader.org/works/addresses/file2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglican Christian apologist [[C. S. Lewis]] voiced a similar view in the 20th century, arguing that "theology of the liberal type" amounted to a complete re-invention of Christianity and a rejection of Christianity as understood by its own founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |authorlink=C. S. Lewis |date=1988 |title=The essential C.S. Lewis |location=New York |publisher=[[Collier Books]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7YYhHvuNNzIC&amp;pg=PA353 353] |isbn=0020195508 |oclc=17840856 |quote=All theology of the liberal type involves at some point—and often involves throughout—the claim that the real behavior and purpose and teaching of Christ came very rapidly to be misunderstood and misrepresented by his followers, and has been recovered or exhumed only by modern scholars.}} (From an essay titled "Modern theology and biblical criticism" written in 1959.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the development of liberal theology in Christianity, German-Jewish religious reformers began to incorporate [[critical thought]] and humanist ideas into [[Judaism]] from the early 19th century. This resulted in the creation of various non-Orthodox denominations, from the moderately liberal [[Conservative Judaism]] to very liberal [[Reform Judaism]]. The moderate wing of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], especially [[Open Orthodoxy]], espouses a similar approach.

While Christianity and Judaism in the Western world have had to deal with [[modernity]] since its emergence in the 18th century—or even since the [[Renaissance]] and its consequences of [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]]&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt;—[[Islam]] (along with Jewish and Christian traditions in the [[Middle East]]) was not immediately affected by modernity and Enlightenment philosophy. Examples of [[liberal movements within Islam]] are [[Progressive British Muslims]] (formed following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London terrorist attacks]], defunct by 2012), [[British Muslims for Secular Democracy]] (formed 2006), or [[Muslims for Progressive Values]] (formed 2007).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Similarly, [[Eastern religions]] were not immediately affected by liberalism and Enlightenment philosophy, and have partly undertaken reform movements only after contact with Western philosophy in the 19th or 20th centuries. Thus [[Hindu reform movements]] emerged in British India in the 19th century. [[Buddhist modernism]] (or "New Buddhism") arose in its Japanese form as a reaction to the [[Meiji Restoration]], and was again transformed outside of Japan in the 20th century, notably giving rise to modern [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McMahan |first=David L. |date=2008 |title=The making of Buddhist modernism |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780195183276 |oclc=216938497 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195183276.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Havnevik |editor1-first=Hanna |editor2-last=Hüsken |editor2-first=Ute |editor3-last=Teeuwen |editor3-first=Mark |editor4-last=Tikhonov |editor4-first=Vladimir |editor5-last=Wellens |editor5-first=Koen |date=2017 |title=Buddhist modernities: re-inventing tradition in the globalizing modern world |series=Routledge studies in religion |volume=54 |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781138687844 |oclc=970042282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberal religion in Unitarianism==
{{Main|Unitarian Universalism}}
The term '''liberal religion''' has been used by [[Unitarianism|Unitarian Christians]]&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;For example: {{cite journal |last=Ellis |first=George Edward |authorlink=George Edward Ellis |date=November 1856 |title=Relations of reason and faith |journal=The Christian Examiner and Religious Miscellany |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=412–456 (444–445, 450) |location=Boston |publisher=Crosby, Nichols, and Company for the [[American Unitarian Association]] |oclc=6122907 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4g3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA412 |quote=The first of all the requisites in such a religion is that it shall be Liberal. We ''mention'' this condition even before that of Truth, because a religion that is not liberal cannot be true. The devout and intelligent demand a liberal religion, a religion large, free, generous, comprehensive in its lessons, a religion expansive in its spirit, lofty in its views, and with a sweep of blessings as wide as the range of man's necessities and sins. This is what is meant by a Liberal Religion, or Liberal views of religion, or Liberal Christianity. [...] Thoughtful, earnest, and devout minds now demand a liberal religion. Liberal in the honest, pure, and noble sense of that word. Not liberal in the sense of license, recklessness, or indifference; not in making a scoff of holy restraints and solemn mysteries. Not liberal as the worldling or the fool uses the word, for overthrowing all distinctions, and reducing life to a revel or a riot. [...] Such a faith cannot afford to raise an issue with reason on a single point, so far as their road on the highway of truth will allow them to keep company together. When they part for faith to advance beyond reason, they must part in perfect harmony.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Unitarian Universalist]]s&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Robert |date=1995 |chapter=The church green: ecology and the future |editor1-last=O'Neal |editor1-first=Dan |editor2-last=Wesley |editor2-first=Alice Blair |editor3-last=Ford |editor3-first=James Ishmael |editor3-link=James Ishmael Ford |title=The transient and permanent in liberal religion: reflections from the UUMA Convocation on Ministry |location=Boston |publisher=Skinner House Books |pages=195–206 (195) |isbn=1558963308 |oclc=35280453 |quote=Does liberal religion have a future? If we answer in the affirmative, can we begin to imagine the outlines of liberal religion in the next century? What will the Unitarian Universalist movement look like in the decade of the 2090s?}} ''Cf.'' {{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Robert L'H. |date=Spring 1976 |title=The religious value system of Unitarian Universalists |journal=[[Review of Religious Research]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=189–208 |doi=10.2307/3510610 |jstor=3510610 |quote=The repetition of the distinctive pattern in both higher and lower ranking of both terminal and instrumental values leads one to a firmer basis for sensing a distinctive Unitarian Universalist pattern of religiousness. It is, perhaps, more accurately defined as a pattern of liberal religion which further research may disclose is typical, for example, of such groups as Reform Judaism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to their own brand of religious liberalism, although the term has also been used by non-Unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;For example, on [[Quakerism]] as liberal religion: {{cite book |editor1-last=Dandelion |editor1-first=Pink |editor2-last=Collins |editor2-first=Peter |date=2008 |title=The Quaker condition: the sociology of a liberal religion |location=Newcastle |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |page=18 |isbn=9781847185655 |oclc=227278348 |quote=This is the first book of its kind and is intended to be the beginning, rather than the final word. It adds considerably to the study of Quakerism but also to the study of Liberal religion per se.}} And on [[Islam]] as liberal religion: {{cite journal |last=Foody |first=Kathleen |date=October 2016 |title=Pedagogical projects: teaching liberal religion after 9/11 |journal=The Muslim World |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=719–739 |doi=10.1111/muwo.12167}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Journal of Liberal Religion'' was published by the Unitarian Ministerial Union, [[Meadville Theological School]], and Universalist Ministerial Association from 1939 to 1949, and was edited by [[James Luther Adams]], an influential Unitarian theologian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Journal of Liberal Religion |website=worldcat.org |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/4714979 |oclc=4714979 |accessdate=2017-11-20}} Published from 1939 to 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, a new version of the journal was published in an online format from 1999 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Journal of Liberal Religion |url=http://www.meadville.edu/page.php?page=71 |website=meadville.edu |issn=1527-9324 |accessdate=2017-11-22}} Published from 1999 to 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rot op met je religie''''' (English: ''To Hell With Your Religion'') is a 2017 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television series by the [[Evangelische Omroep]], presented by Kefah Allush.

== Setting and purpose ==
In this [[Reality television|reality show]], four [[religion|religious people]] (two [[Christianity|Christians]], a [[Islam|Muslim]] and a [[Judaism|Jew]]) and two [[atheism|atheists]] live together in the same house in [[Haarlem]], and discuss and debate their religious beliefs, practices and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7LJvru7g4U |title=De Nieuwe Maan - Rot op met je religie |work=De Nieuwe Maan |publisher=[[Omroep NTR|NTR]] |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features mutual [[criticism of religion]] as well as [[interfaith dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/rot-op-met-je-religie/ |title=Rot op met je religie |author=Thimo den Hartog |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants also travel across the Netherlands to visit [[Place of worship|houses of worship]], an [[abortion clinic]] and a [[Dhabihah|halal]] [[slaughterhouse]] amongst other places, and cook together despite their widely varying ethical views on food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/filmenuitgaan/rtv/26697584/__EO__Rot_op_met_je_geloof__.html |title=EO: Rot op met je geloof |author=Marcel Frost |work=[[De Telegraaf]] |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/de-ultieme-religiestress-test-in-rot-op-met-je-religie-op-npo2/ |title=De ultieme religiestress-test in ‘Rot op met je religie’ op NPO2 |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |date=6 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EO hopes the programme will show what 'religious stress'&lt;ref&gt;The neologism ''religiestress'' ("religious stress") was coined in 2012 by Dutch theologian Tom Mikkers, who works for the EO.&lt;/ref&gt; does to the candidates, and what effect this has on their beliefs. Just before the first episode was broadcast, the EO published a survey about religious stress amongst Dutch citizens, which showed amongst other things that 93% of the population is in favour of [[freedom of speech]], and 82% supports [[freedom of religion]], but almost half think that [[secularism|religion should not be professed in public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.rd.nl/kerk-religie/eo-nederlanders-ervaren-dilemma-s-rond-religie-1.1365904 |title=EO: Nederlanders ervaren dilemma’s rond religie |work=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]] |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the EO made similar programmes about [[refugee]]s (''Rot op naar je eigen land'', "Piss Off To Your Own Country", 2015) and [[environmental issue]]s (''[[Rot op met je milieu]]'', "Get Lost With Your Environment", 2016).&lt;ref name="Heesakkers"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/televisie/een-hoop-pleuris-en-religiestress-in-rot-op-met-je-religie~a4450288/ |title=Een hoop pleuris en religiestress in 'Rot op met je religie' |author=Gidi Heesakkers |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=18 January 2017 |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Stichting KijkOnderzoek, a [[Nielsen ratings|ratings tracking]] service, reported that about 531,000 people watched the first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nieuwwij.nl/nieuws/ruim-half-miljoen-kijkers-rot-op-religie/ |title=Ruim half miljoen kijkers voor 'Rot op met je religie' |work=NieuwWij.nl |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', the EO used the programme to deliberately fan the flames of religious stress, and by their selection of participants created an unfair representation of the various worldviews: "The [[casting]] wants us to primarily look for reasonableness amongst the four religious participants (...). Even the two non-believers clash occasionally, because one is [[veganism|vegan]] and the other finds that to be politically correct bullshit. In short: in the first episode, the religious stress isn't quite fairly distributed yet between the followers of [[God]] and those who reject the existence of the fairytale character of god."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/01/17/de-eo-stookt-de-religiestress-nog-op-6246021-a1541592 |title=De EO stookt de religiestress verder op |author=Hans Beerekamp |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three episodes, ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', too, concluded that "the EO does everything within their power to let all hell break loose. There is no live and let live." Just like in the previous ''Rot op'' series, the programme would primarily be "about confrontation, heated discussions and perhaps a vain hope of reconciliation." It noted that the most fierce nonbeliever, Floris, "is portrayed the least sympathetic by the montage so far." On the preview of the fourth episode, in which Safeer shows his unease when meeting a [[Islam and homosexuality|gay Muslim]], the newspaper's reviewer (referencing [[Genesis 1:4]]) commented: "Someone saw the announcement, and saw it was not good. ''Stress!''"
&lt;ref name="Heesakkers"/&gt;

A critic from ThePostOnline disagreed with the ''Volkskrant'''s criticism of the montage: "By definition, media select that which is appetising." On the contrary, 'sensational television' is interesting, especially to discover who 'understands the art of living and tolerance best'. In his opinion, the atheist and vegan Floris, "whose raised voice against his religious fellow man may go into Dutch television history as legendary", drawing the comparison to the late politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], finishes last in this regard, followed by the imam Safeer, whilst sympathy for the atheist Bryan is growing throughout the series, and the Jewish Sheila has had the audience's sympathy from the beginning. Furthermore, the EO allegedly lacked a sense of humour, and the idea of 'let it be' would only rarely feature in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.tpo.nl/2017/01/19/rot-op-religie-minder-minder-minder-veganisten/ |title=Rot op met je religie: Minder, minder, minder veganisten |author=Peter Olsthoorn |work=ThePostOnline |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sacred''' is dedicated or set apart for the service or worship of a [[deity]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sacred&lt;/ref&gt; or considered worthy of spiritual [[respect]] or devotion; or inspiring [[awe]] or [[Reverence (emotion)|reverence]] among believers. The property is often ascribed to objects (a "sacred artifact" that is [[Veneration|venerated]] and [[Blessing|blessed]]), or places ("sacred ground").

French [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] considered the [[dichotomy]] between the sacred and the [[profanum|profane]] to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1915, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or [[totems]]. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns.

Although there are similarities between the terms "sacred" and "holy" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences.&lt;ref name=difference&gt;[http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-sacred-and-holy/ "Difference Between Sacred and Holy", DifferenceBetween.com, September 26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; "Holiness" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while "sacredness" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YGX6oKlw24UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSBrWEffCh&amp;sig=3Bjyli7MdxC5cMQ0L544nETGNTk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixsdmn3LjQAhVq44MKHSCVC8k4FBDoAQg7MAs#v=onepage&amp;q=holiness%20vs%20sacredness&amp;f=false McCann, Catherine.

==Etymology==
The word "sacred" descends from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:sacer|sacer]]'', that is consecrated, or dedicated&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NmogAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA889&amp;lpg=PA889&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZSLIJdyPqp&amp;sig=zO322whbPNR1CiW-VdfEIncC6ss&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZv5aJ0LjQAhUB7IMKHQcJBcw4ChDoAQg5MAc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sacred", ''A Dictionary of the English Language'' (James Stormonth, Philip Henry Phelp, eds.), Blackwood &amp; sons, 1895, p.883]&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods or anything in their power, and to ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos]]'' and ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sanctum]]'', set apart.

Although there are similarities between the terms "sacred" and "holy" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences.&lt;ref name=difference&gt;[http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-sacred-and-holy/ "Difference Between Sacred and Holy", DifferenceBetween.com, September 26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; "Holiness" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while "sacredness" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YGX6oKlw24UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSBrWEffCh&amp;sig=3Bjyli7MdxC5cMQ0L544nETGNTk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixsdmn3LjQAhVq44MKHSCVC8k4FBDoAQg7MAs#v=onepage&amp;q=holiness%20vs%20sacredness&amp;f=false McCann, Catherine. ''New Paths Toward the Sacred Thus'', Paulist Press, 2008] {{ISBN|9780809145515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a saint may be considered as holy, but he is not viewed as sacred. However, there are things that are both holy and sacred such as the holy bible.&lt;ref name=difference/&gt;

The English word "holy" dates back to at least the 11th century with the [[Old English]] word ''[[hālig]]'', an adjective derived from ''hāl'' meaning "whole" and used to mean "uninjured, sound, healthy, entire, complete". The Scottish ''hale'' ("health, happiness and wholeness") is the most complete modern form of this Old English root. The word "holy" in its modern form appears in [[Wycliffe's Bible]] of 1382. In non-specialist contexts, the term "holy" is used in a more general way, to refer to someone or something that is associated with a [[Divine grace|divine power]], such as [[Holy water|water]] used for [[baptism]].

While both words denote something or someone set apart to the worship of God and therefore worthy of respect and in some cases veneration, "holy" (the stronger word) implies an inherent or essential character.&lt;ref&gt;"Sacred", ''
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 5th edition, p.875&lt;/ref&gt; Holiness originates in God and is communicated to things, places, times, and persons engaged in His Service. Thus Aquinas Thomas defines "holiness" as that virtue by which a man's mind applies itself and all its acts to God; he ranks it among the infused moral [[Virtue|virtues]], and identifies it with the virtue of religion, but with this difference that, whereas religion is the virtue whereby one offers God due service in the things which pertain to the Divine service, holiness is the virtue by which one makes all one's acts subservient to God. Thus holiness or sanctity is the outcome of sanctification, that Divine act by which God freely justifies a person, and by which He has claimed them for His own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm Pope, Hugh.

{{Main article|History of religions}}
[[Mircea Eliade]] outlines that religion should not be interpreted only as 'belief in deities', but as 'experience of the sacred'. He analyses the dialectic of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Altizer, Thomas J. J. (1968), ''Mircea Eliade and the Dialectic of the Sacred'', Philadelphia: The Westminster Press. {{ISBN|978-083-7171-96-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred is presented in relation to the profane.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1987), ''The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion'', translated by Willard R.

===Sociology===
{{Main article|Sacred–profane dichotomy}}
French [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] considered the [[dichotomy]] between the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] and the [[profanum|profane]] to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1915, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or [[totems]]. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the dichotomy sacred/profane was not equivalent to [[Good and evil|good/evil]]. The sacred could be [[good]] or [[evil]], and the profane could be either as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pals 1996, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

===Buddhism===
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism one finds the designation of 'noble person' or ''ariyapuggala''  ([[Pali]]). The Buddha described four grades of such person depending on their level of purity. This purity is measured by which of the ten [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetter]]s (''samyojana'') and ''[[Kleśā (Buddhism)|klesha]]'' have been purified and integrated from the [[mindstream]]. These persons are called (in order of increasing sanctity) ''[[Sotāpanna]]'', ''[[Sakadagami]]'', ''[[Anāgāmi]]'' and ''[[Arhat|Arahant]]''.

===Christianity===
{{Attributes of God}}
More traditional [[Christian denominations|denominations]], such as the [[Anglican]], [[Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Methodist]] Churches, believe in [[Holy Sacraments]] that the clergy perform, such as [[Holy Communion]] and [[Holy Baptism]], as well as strong belief in the [[Four marks of the church|Holy Catholic Church]], [[Bible|Holy Scripture]], [[Holy Trinity]], and the [[Covenant (biblical)|Holy Covenant]]. They also believe that angels and saints are called to holiness.

====Catholicism====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Purgatory]] --&gt;

[[File:Persian Cock.jpg|thumb|right|Vatican Persian Cock – A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian [[rooster|cock]] or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican ([[Holy See]]) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] denoting the status of being holy or sacred.]]
[[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] has inherited much of the Jewish vision of the world in terms of holiness, with certain behaviour appropriate to certain places and times. The calendar gives shape to Catholic practice, which tends to focus on the [[Eucharist]], in which the [[Real Presence]] of [[Christ]] is manifested. [[feast day|Holy days]], celebrating events of the life of Christ and the lives of [[Saint#Catholic Church|Catholic saints]] officially recognized as holy, are celebrated throughout the year.

Many features of the Jewish temple (although now seen as having Christian significance) are imitated in [[Church (building)|churches]], such as the [[altar]], bread, lamp, [[incense]], [[baptismal font|font]], etc., to emphasise the extreme holiness of the Eucharistic elements, which are reserved in a [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]]. In extension of this focus on the Sacrament as holy, many objects in Catholicism are also considered holy. They are called [[sacramentals]] and are usually blessed by a priest. Such items include [[rosary|rosaries]], [[crucifix]]es, medals, and statues and icons of [[Jesus]], [[angel]]s and [[saint]]s (e.g. [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]). While Catholics believe that holy places and objects (i.e., objects dedicated to God for sacred use) should be respected and not put to profane use, the [[Catholic Church]] condemns worshiping the object itself, as any worship given to something other than God is considered [[idolatry]].

People in a state of sanctifying [[Actual grace|grace]] are also considered holy in Catholicism. A central notion of Catholicism as articulated in contemporary theology is the "[personal] call to holiness," considered to be a [[vocation]] shared by every Christian believer. Profound personal holiness has traditionally also been seen as a focus for the kind of contagious holiness primarily associated with the Sacrament. So the [[communion of saints]] in Catholicism is not only the acclamation of their [[piety]] or [[morality]], but also reverence for the tangible holiness that flows from their proximity to the divine. Hence the places where saints lived, died, performed miracles, or received visions frequently become sites of [[pilgrimage]], and notable objects surviving a saint (including the body or parts of it) are considered [[relics]]. The holiness of such places or objects, resulting from contact with a deeply holy person, is often connected with the miraculous long after the death of the saint.

[[Sanctus]] (Latin for "holy") is the name of an important hymn of Christian liturgy. The [[Trisagion]] ('Thrice Holy') is a standard hymn of the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Churches.

====Lutheranism====
[[File:Chancel of Trinity Lutheran Church on Easter Sunday.jpeg|thumb|On [[Easter Sunday]], the [[chancel]] of this Lutheran church is adorned with [[Lilium longiflorum|Easter lilies]], a symbol of the [[resurrection of Christ]], and white [[parament]]s, the liturgical colour of [[Eastertide]].]]
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The early Protestant Reformers, who were often scholars of Ancient Greek and also borrowed from Jewish scholarship, recognized that holiness is an [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute]] of [[God]], and holiness is always part of the [[presence of God]]. Yet they also recognized that "practical holiness" was the evidence of the presence of God in the converted believer. [[Martin Luther]] viewed God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] (and therefore God's holiness), as an invasion of the life. Actions that demonstrated holiness would spring up, not premeditated, as believers focused more and more on their relationship with Christ. This was the life of [[faith]], according to Luther; a life in which one recognizes that the sin inherent in human nature never departs, yet grace invades each human spirit and draws each person after Christ.

====Reformed====
[[John Calvin|Calvin]], on the other hand, formulated a practical system of holiness that even tied in with culture and social [[justice]]. All unholy actions, Calvin reasoned, resulted in [[suffering]]. Thus he proved out to the city fathers of [[Geneva]] that dancing and other social vices always ended with the wealthy oppressing the poor. A holy life, in his outlook, was pietistic and simple, a life that shunned extravagance, excess, and vanity. On a personal level, Calvin believed that suffering would be a manifestation of taking on the [[Cross of Christ]], but suffering was also part of the process of holiness. He expected that all Christians would suffer in this life, not as punishment, but rather as participation in union with Christ, who suffered for them. And yet, socially, Calvin argued that a holy society would end up as a gentle, kindly society (except to criminals) where the poor would be protected from the abuses of the wealthy, the lawyers, and others who normally preyed upon them.

====Wesleyan-Arminian====
{{further|Works of Piety}}
In [[Methodism]], holiness has acquired the secondary meaning of the reshaping of a person through spiritual [[Born again (Christianity)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Visitor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEAEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA137|year=1876|publisher=Elliot Stock, 62, Paternoster Row, E.C. |page=137|quote="Ye must be born again." Yield to God that He may perform this work in and for you. Admit Him to your heart. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term owes its origin to [[John Wesley]], who stressed "scriptural holiness", as well as [[Christian perfection]].

The [[Holiness movement]] began within [[Methodism]] in the [[United States]], among those who thought the church had lost the zeal and emphasis on personal holiness of Wesley's day. In the latter part of the 19th century revival meetings were held, attended by thousands. In [[Vineland, New Jersey|Vineland, N.J]] in 1867 a camp meeting was begun and the National Holiness Camp Meeting Association went on to establish many holiness [[camp meeting]]s across the nation. Some adherents to the movement remained within their denominations; others founded new denominations, such as the [[Free Methodist Church]], the [[Church of the Nazarene]], and the [[Church of God (Anderson)]]. Within a generation another movement, the Pentecostal movement was born, drawing heavily from the Holiness movement. Around the middle of the 20th century, the [[Conservative Holiness Movement]], a conservative offshoot of the Holiness movement, was born. The [[Higher Life movement]] appeared in the British Isles during the mid-19th century.

In the contemporary Holiness movement, the idea that holiness is relational is growing. In this thought, the core notion of holiness is [[love]]. Other notions of holiness, such as purity, being set apart, perfection, keeping rules, and total commitment, are seen as contributory notions of holiness. These contributory notions find their ultimate legitimacy when love is at their core ([[Thomas Jay Oord]] and Michael Lodahl).

Commonly recognized outward expressions or "standards" of holiness among more fundamental adherents frequently include applications relative to dress, hair, and appearance:  e.g., short hair on men, uncut hair on women, and prohibitions against shorts, pants on women, make-up and jewelry. Other common injunctions are against places of worldly amusement, mixed swimming, smoking, [[minced oaths]], as well as the eschewing of television and radio.

It shares the [[Q-D-Š|same triliteral Semitic root]] as the Hebrew ''kodesh'' (see below). Another use of the same root is found in the Arabic name for Jerusalem: ''[[al-Quds]]'', "the Holy".

The word حرام ''(ħarām)'', often translated as "prohibited" or "forbidden", is better understood as "sacred" or "sanctuary" in the context of places considered sacred in Islam, ''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'': the ''[[Masjid al-Haram]]'', the Sacred Mosque in [[Mecca]], constituting the immediate precincts of the [[Ka'aba]]; ''[[Haram (site)|al-Haramain]]'' or "the (two) Sanctuaries", a reference to the twin holy cities of Mecca and [[Medina]]; and the ''[[Haram ash-Sharif]]'' or Noble Sanctuary, the precincts of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]].

===Judaism===
{{see also|Q-D-Š|Tzadik|Holy of Holies}}
The Hebrew word קֹדֶשׁ, transliterated as ''qodesh'', has been used in the [[Torah]] to mean set-apartness and separateness as well as holiness and sacredness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org//lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=h6944&amp;t=HNV
|title="H6944 - qodesh - Strong's Hebrew Lexicon (HNV)."
|author=Blue Letter Bible.
|accessdate=28 Jun 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah describes the [[Kohen|Aaronite priests]] and the [[Levite]]s as being selected by God to perform the Temple services; they, as well, are called "holy." Some{{who|date=September 2011}} consider that the Hebrew noun for "holiness," ''kedushah'' ({{lang-he|קדושה}}), from the adjective ''kodesh'', "holy," has the connotation of "separateness".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

However, holiness is not a single state, but contains a broad spectrum. The [[Mishnah]] lists concentric circles of holiness surrounding the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: [[Holy of Holies]], Temple Sanctuary, Temple Vestibule, Court of Priests, Court of Israelites, Court of Women, [[Temple Mount]], the walled city of [[Jerusalem]], all the walled cities of Israel, and the borders of the [[Land of Israel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Distinctions are made as to who and what are permitted in each area.

Likewise, the [[Jewish holidays]] and the [[Shabbat]] are considered to be holy in time; the Torah calls them "holy [days of] gathering". Work is not allowed on those days, and rabbinic tradition lists [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|39 categories of activity]] that are specifically prohibited.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Beyond the intrinsically holy, objects can become sacred through [[consecration]]. Any personal possession may be dedicated to the Temple of God, after which its misappropriation is considered among the gravest of sins. The various [[Korban|sacrifices]] are holy. Those that may be eaten have very specific rules concerning who may eat which of their parts, and time limits on when the consumption must be completed. Most sacrifices contain a part to be consumed by the priests – a portion of the holy to be consumed by God's holy devotees.

The encounter with the holy is seen as eminently desirable, and at the same time fearful and awesome. For the strongest penalties are applied to one who transgresses in this area – one could in theory receive either the death penalty or the heavenly punishment of ''[[kareth]]'', spiritual excision, for mis-stepping in his close approach to God's domain.

The '''Sea of Faith Network''' ('''SoF''') is an organisation with the stated aim to explore and promote  religious faith as a human creation.

==History==
The SoF movement started in 1984 as a response to [[Don Cupitt]]'s book and [[Sea of Faith (TV series)|television series]], both titled ''Sea of Faith''.&lt;ref name="Bill Cooke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Bill|title=Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, and Humanism|year=2005|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst NY|isbn=978-1591022992|pages=470|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sA6_jqohqRUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cupitt was educated in both science and theology at the University of Cambridge in the 1950s, and is a philosopher, theologian, [[Anglican]] priest, and former Dean of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt: Life Fellow and former Dean of Emmanuel College Cambridge, England|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/Fellows/cupitt.html|publisher=Westar Institute|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book and TV series, he surveyed western thinking about religion and charted a transition from traditional realist religion to the  view that religion is simply a human creation.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Stangroom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stangroom|first1=Jeremy|last2=Baggini|first2=Julian|authorlink1=Jeremy Stangroom|authorlink2=Julian Baggini|title=What Philosophers Think|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=978-0826484741|pages=95–104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P6jT10cRPXQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Sea of Faith is taken from [[Matthew Arnold]]'s nostalgic mid 19th century poem "[[Dover Beach]]", in which the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the "sea of faith" is withdrawing like the ebbing tide.&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt sea of faith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cupitt|first=Don|title=The Sea of Faith|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521344203|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCXcdgWck_8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=don+cupitt+dover+beach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fLrsUL3zC6j22gWH_YGICw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the television series, a small group of radical Christian clergy and laity began meeting to explore how they might promote this new understanding of religious faith. Starting with a mailing list of 143 sympathisers, they organised the first UK conference in 1988.&lt;ref name="Peter B. Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Peter B.|title=Encyclopedia Of New Religious Movements|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415453837|pages=595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second conference was held in the following year shortly after which the SoF Network was officially launched. Annual national conferences have been a key event of the network ever since.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts|url=http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Religious_Studies/Phil_of_Rel/Atheism_Agnosticism/sea_of_faith_network.php|work=That Religious Studies Website|publisher=Pelusa Media Group|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Sea Of Faith Network holds national and regional conferences and promotional events each year. There is an active network of local groups who meet regularly for discussion and exploration.&lt;ref name=sofn&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith Network] retrieved 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's magazine ''Sofia'' is published bi-monthly in the United Kingdom. It has a circulation beyond the SoF membership. The group also maintains a web site and an on-line discussion group.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

Currently there are national networks in the UK, New Zealand and Australia with scattered membership in the USA, Northern Ireland, South Africa, France and The Netherlands. The world-wide membership, as of 2004, stood at about 2,000. Each national network is run by a steering committee elected from its members.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Beliefs==
SoF has no official creed or statement of belief to which members are required to assent, seeing itself as a loose network rather than a formal religious movement or organisation. Its stated aim is to "explore and promote religious faith as a human creation".&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are|url=http://www.sofn.org.uk/sof/who_we_are.html|publisher=Sea of Faith Network|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this it spans a broad spectrum of faith positions from uncompromising non-realism at one end to critical realism at the other.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are" /&gt;  Some members describe themselves as on the liberal or radical wing of conventional belief (see [[liberal Christianity]]) while others choose to call themselves [[religious humanism|religious]] or [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] (see [[humanism]]). Some even refer to themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply nontheist (see [[Christian atheism]]).

SoF possesses no religious writings or ceremonies of its own; many members remain active in their own religion (mainly but not exclusively Christian) while others have no religious affiliation at all.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Philosophy==
A number of commentators have identified SoF as closely associated with the non-realist approach to religion.&lt;ref name="andrew moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Andrew|title=Realism and Christian Faith: God, Grammar, and Meaning|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521524155|pages=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54AgRQ0QbZIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cathey&gt;{{cite book|last=Cathey|first=Robert Andrew|title=God In Postliberal Perspective: Between Realism and Non-Realism|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Burlington VT|isbn=978-0754616801|pages=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkVppp6cfcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the belief that God has no "real", objective, or empirical existence, independent of human language and culture; God is "real" in the sense that he is a potent symbol, metaphor or projection, but he has no objective existence outside and beyond the practice of religion.&lt;ref name="peter mullen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mullen|first=Peter|title=Faith and Reason Cupitt's arrows lie blunted by the reality of reasoned discussion|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/faith-and-reason-cupitts-arrows-lie-blunted-by-the-reality-of-reasoned-discussion-1391036.html|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=31 Dec 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-realism therefore entails a rejection of all supernaturalism, including concepts such as miracles, the afterlife, and the agency of spirits.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network|url=http://www.stoa.org.uk/topics/sof/sea-of-faith-network.html|publisher=Faversham Stoa|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupitt wrote, "God is the sum of our values, representing to us their ideal unity, their claims upon us and their creative power".&lt;ref&gt;''Taking Leave of God'', Don Cupitt, SCM, 1980, 2001 edition: {{ISBN|0-334-02840-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cupitt calls this "a voluntarist interpretation of faith: a fully demythologized version of Christianity".&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt; It entails the claim that even after we have given up the idea that religious beliefs can be grounded in anything beyond the human realm, religion can still be believed and practised in new ways.&lt;ref name="Gail Vines"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vines|first=Gail|title=A Godless creed|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=99906&amp;sectioncode=26|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=19 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder's influence==
Since he began writing in 1971, Cupitt has produced 36 books. During this time his views have continued to evolve and change.&lt;ref name="nigel leaves"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaves|first=Nigel|title=Odyssey on the Sea of Faith: The Life &amp; Writings of Don Cupitt|year=2004|publisher=Polebridge Press|location=Santa Rosa CA|isbn=978-0944344620|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his early books such as ''Taking Leave of God'' and ''The Sea of Faith'' Cupitt talks of God alone as non-real,&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God|url=http://philosophybites.com/2008/11/don-cupitt-on-nonrealism-about-god.html|work=philosophy bites|publisher=Institute of Philosophy|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the 1980s he moved into [[postmodernism]], describing his position as empty radical humanism:&lt;ref name="About Non-Realism"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Non-Realism|url=http://www.doncupitt.com/non-realism|publisher=Don Cupitt|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, there is nothing but our language, our world, and the meanings, truths and interpretations that we have generated. Everything is non-real, including God.&lt;ref name=hyman&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyman|first=Gavin|title=The Predicament of Postmodern Theology: Radical Orthodoxy or Nihilist Textualism?|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville KY|isbn=978-0664223663|pages=44–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VuXIL7amXvIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Cupitt was the founding influence of SoF and is much respected for his work for the network, it would not be true to say that he is regarded as a guru or leader of SoF. Members are free to dissent from his views and Cupitt himself has argued strongly that SoF should never be a fan club.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;  Both Cupitt and the network emphasise the importance of autonomous critical thought and reject authoritarianism in all forms.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;

'''The Bible and humor''' is a topic of [[Biblical criticism]] concerned with the question of whether parts of the Bible were intended to convey [[humor]] in [[Humor styles|any style]]. Historically, this topic has not received much attention, but modern scholars generally agree that humor can be found in biblical texts.

==Scholarly assessment==
{{Bible sidebar |expanded=interpretation}}
Finding [[Humor|humor]] in the [[Bible]], for those who hold reverence toward the Bible, can be hindered by that seriousness, but it can be difficult for anyone because humor does not translate well from culture to culture or from language to language. It is also difficult to pick up on humor in written form. The age of the texts makes it difficult to be sure that what we are interpreting as humor was intended as humor by the author. Finding humor in the Bible requires a broad eclectic definition of humor and some awareness of literary types of humor such as satire, farce, parody, irony and so on. Therefore, the vast majority of Bible interpreters over the last 1,500 years have not only not detected humor in the Bible, they have often discounted or even disdained the possibility of humor in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Radday"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4OtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|title=On Humour and the Comic in the Hebrew Bible|first1=Yehuda Thomas|last1=Radday|first2=Yehuda T.|last2=Radday|first3=Athalya|last3=Brenner|date=7 February 1990|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|accessdate=7 February 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781850757016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13-19}}
 
Professor Yehuda T. Radday notes that some scholars have flat out denied that humor in the Bible exists. He references a 1984 conference in Israel on the subject of [[Jewish humor]], where no attention was given to humor in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Radday"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Radday goes on to say "it is a widespread misconception that the Bible is lacking in humor."&lt;ref name="Radday"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

Scholars like Steven C. Walker, a professor of literature, and Howard R. Macy, a professor of religion, claim humor is prevalent in the Bible. Macy says that "if we think that humor in the Bible mostly looks like stand-up comedy or telling jokes, we won't see much of that."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macy|first1=Howard R.|title=Discovering Humor in the Bible: An Explorer's Guide|date=2016|publisher=[[Cascade Books]]|isbn=978-1-4982-9261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Anthony J. Perotta, priest and professor at [[Fuller Seminary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivpress.com/anthony-j-petrotta|title=Anthony J. Petrotta - InterVarsity Press|website=www.ivpress.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... humor as we know it today is probably not part of the Bible any more than love (and marriage, etc.) as we know it today is a feature of the Bible. But this is a minor point, maybe even trivial and pedantic. ... The ancient Hebrews loved and married—and joked—no doubt, in a different idiom than "we" do, but they still engaged in such activities and we can speak about those activities without being anachronistic or solipsistic&lt;ref name="Anthony J. Perrota"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Perotta|author1-first=Anthony J.|editor1-last=Ellens|editor1-first=J.Harold|editor2-last=Greene|editor2-first=John T.|title=Probing the Frontiers of Biblical Studies|date=2009|publisher=[[Pickwick Publications]]|location=Eugene, Oregon|isbn=978-1-60608-460-1|chapter=Chapter 16, A Test of Balaam: Locating Humor in the Biblical Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|280}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor of Jewish theology and Near Eastern studies Leonard Greenspoon says, "In sum, biblical humor is certainly not stand-up comedy nor is it especially cerebral either. Rather, it is participatory and fully in keeping with the overall themes and emphases of the Hebrew Bible."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenspoon|first1=Leonard|title=Focus On Humor in the Old Testament|url=https://global.oup.com/obso/focus/focus_on_humor_ot/|website=Oxford Biblical Studies Online|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author David A. Peters states that he finds over a thousand "humorous lines and stories" in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HOdw7t0-G5UC&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Many Faces of Biblical Humor: A Compendium of the Most Delightful, Romantic, Humorous, Ironic, Sarcastic, or Pathetically Funny Stories and Statements in Scripture|first=David A.|last=Peters|date=6 November 2007|publisher=[[Hamilton Books]]|page=7|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781461626978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is general agreement the kind of humor that ''can'' be found in the Bible becomes apparent when the Bible is viewed as literature. Rev. Marion Daniel Shutter asserts we would find genuine wit if, in literature other than the Bible, we came across sentences such as that found in Proverbs 26:17: ''Interfering in someone else's argument is as foolish as yanking a dog's ears''. He says, "When [[Isaiah]] characterizes certain ones as 'mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink,' does he not use essentially the same reproach [[Prince Hal]] fastened upon [[Falstaff]], 'Wherin is he good but to taste sack and drink it?"&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shutter|first=Marion Daniel|title=Wit and Humor of the Bible: A Literary Study|date=1893|publisher=[[Arena Publishing Co.]]|location=Boston, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}  Macy says the Bible authors use dark humor, satire, a great deal of wit, and are particularly fond of the dry humor that goes with exaggeration.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|18-24}} Walker adds, "The humor of the Bible is deadpan. It sneaks up on you."&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Steven C.|title=Illuminating Humor of the Bible|date=2013|publisher=[[Cascade Books]]|location=Eugene, Washington|isbn=978-1-62032-148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

When discussing biblical humor scholars generally agree humor is often in the situation itself. Macy gives the examples of Sarah having Isaac at the age of ninety, and  the Messiah turning up in a barn. Macy says "The Bible gives us tale after tale of comic reversals and narrow escapes."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  He says "mischievous exploits", names and name changes, literary plays on words, exaggeration, and the unexpected: a surprising word, an unexpected phrase, or an abrupt change of direction are what the Bible uses to convey wit and humor.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|5,9}}  According to Macy, the book of Proverbs includes funny images and word-play while "trickster themes also bring surprise and laughter."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|5,18}} Professor of Biblical Literature J. William Whedbee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortresspress.com/author/j-william-whedbee|title=J. William Whedbee|date=1 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; says the biblical authors use "humorous juxtaposition" where things seem funny because they're together: for example, short and tall, fat and thin, irony and paradox.  Those scholars who do find humor in the Bible agree the odd, awkward, or absurd such as mismatches in character and actions, are examples of how the Bible uses humor. "[[Balaam]] the 'seer' who doesn't 'see' or 'know' what's going on, and his donkey who both sees and knows," is an example of this type of wit and humor in the Bible.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8|title=The Bible and the Comic Vision|first=J.

==Hebrew Bible==


===Genesis===
Macy, Walker, M. D. Shutter, and other scholars contend Genesis has several stories that offer humor through absurdity, trickery, surprises and reversals. Macy says that in speaking of humor in the Bible he usually begins with asking how it might feel to personally get [[Abraham#Three_visitors|the message Abraham and Sarah received]], putting them into the absurd situation of a ninety year old having a baby.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|83}}  He argues that the Biblical author shows that the situation is replete with humor: "[[Abraham]] laughs, [[Sarah]] laughs, everybody else laughs, and they name the baby 'laughter' or He-laughs [Isaac Yitzack]."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|83}} 

Humor in Genesis, Macy says, includes "Both Abraham and [[Isaac]] trying to pass off their wives as their sisters, [however] translations of Genesis 26:8 range from [Isaac and his 'sister'] "laughing together" to "caressing" or "fondling" to "making love" giving evidence of Isaac's 'savvy' in pulling off the lie. [[Jacob]] and [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] make deals with each other that make a reader cringe. In Genesis 18, the topic is serious but bargaining with God looks a lot like buying a used car."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

Walker says Genesis contains several "odd couples" that contrast and complement each other like '[[Laurel and Hardy]]': [[Jacob and Esau]], Abraham and Sarah, Abraham and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]], Jacob and Laban, Moses and [[Aaron]], and others. He adds, "Bible characters learn a lot about their own 'dark sides' by those contrasts."&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|Preface:XII}}  The pattern of reversal of fundamental motifs such as primogeniture are evidence of humor according to Walker. He references 12 incidents in Genesis of younger sons getting the better of their elder brothers.&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|51}}

Greenspoon offers Genesis 4 as an example of Biblical humor using ironic wordplay with names.  After murdering his brother and attempting to shift the blame, [[Cain]] is condemned to wander ceaselessly, but after complaining God agrees to let him settle in the land of Nod. Greenspoon says, "The root of the Hebrew verb 'to wander' is ''n-w-d'' and "the proper name 'Nod' derives from the same root as the verb 'to wander'...  What sort of settling is Cain likely to experience in a land whose very name connotes (constant) wandering?"&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

===Exodus===
Greenspoon says [[Aaron]]'s response to getting caught after making the [[golden calf]] is humorous.  "Does Aaron come clean when confronted by his enraged brother...? Not exactly. He does attempt to shift blame—"You know this people is bent on evil". He also admits to asking the people for their gold, at the same time notably truncating the scope of his original request... 
Even though the biblical text had earlier narrated in some detail the active role he took ... [he says]: 'They gave it to me', Aaron concludes, 'and I hurled it into the fire and out came this calf'."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

===Numbers===
[[File:Balaam Rembrandt 01.JPG|thumb|''[[Balaam and the Ass]]'', [[Rembrandt]] 1626]]
Petrotta and others find plenty of humor in the story of Balaam and his talking donkey in the [[Book of Numbers]]. Balaam is repeatedly asked by king [[Balak]] to curse the Israelites, but Balaam can only bless them, making the king increasingly angry.&lt;ref name="Anthony J. Perrota"/&gt;{{rp|296}}&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|64}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HOdw7t0-G5UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Many Faces of Biblical Humor: A Compendium of the Most Delightful, Romantic, Humorous, Ironic, Sarcastic, or Pathetically Funny Stories and Statements in Scripture|first=David A.|last=Peters|date=6 November 2007|publisher=Hamilton Books|page=47|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781461626978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judges===
Shutter finds humor in the ''Fable of the Trees'' (Judges 9). [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] maneuvered to have himself proclaimed king in Shechem, but [[Jotham]] believed he was unfit to rule and the people foolish to accept him. Jotham contrives a satire. "The trees went forth to anoint a king over them. They said to the olive tree, 'reign over us.' But the olive tree answered, ‘Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?’ Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’ But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?’ Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be our king.’ But the vine answered, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?' Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, 'Come and be our king'. The thornbush said to the trees, 'If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'" Then Jotham left "for in that day, as in every subsequent age, there was no room for a satirist in the kingdom of an incompetent ruler".&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|29,30}} 

Shutter also asserts that [[Samson]] is a humorous character, very similar to [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] in [[Sophocles]]' play ''[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]]''. Quoting Rev. A. G. L'Estrange in his ''History of English humor...'', Shutter says: "He was an exaggeration of a not very uncommon type of man in which brute strength is joined to loose morals and whimsical fancy... We can only smile at his folly."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|32,33,37}}

Greenspoon finds humor in the word play of the names and characteristics of two protagonists found in the account of the murder of the King of Moab in the second half of Judges 3.  One of these characters is [[Ehud]], a "left-handed man" from the [[tribe of Benjamin]] (Judg 3:15).  "Such a description serves two functions here: first, as a play on words-—Ehud's tribe, Benjamin, literally means the son of the south, or right. (Ancient Israelites oriented themselves with the Mediterranean Sea behind them and East was straight ahead; so, the south was to their right.) Thus, it would not escape the notice of the reader that here was a "son of the south" or "the right hand" who was left-handed...   Second, because Ehud was left-handed, he strapped his sword to his right thigh... the Moabite king's bodyguards, who would certainly have checked out anyone seeking admittance to their monarch, performed only a perfunctory check on Ehud, never thinking that the weapon would be on his right, rather than the expected left, thigh.   It is especially the name of the Moabite king, [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]], that would have immediately attracted the attention of an ancient reader ... Eglon comes from the same Hebrew root as the word for a fatted calf, often one prepared for sacrifice. And, of course, sacrifice is exactly what Eglon becomes at the hand of Ehud... biblical writers seemed to draw upon just such incidents to display what might be termed the wicked side of their humor."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

===1 Samuel===
[[File:Scuola Grande dei Carmini - Sala dell'Archivio - Abigail calma e disarma David indignato contro suo marito Nabal di Giustino Menescardi.jpg|thumb|Scuola Grande dei Carmini - Sala dell'Archivio - Abigail calma e disarma David indignato contro suo marito Nabal di Giustino Menescardi|left|[[Abigail]] soothes [[David]], who is angry at her husband [[Nabal]]. [[Giustino Menescardi]], mid-18th century]]
According to Shutter, [[Nabal]], a rich man who insults [[David]], is a dark comic character similar to Squire Western in the classic comedy ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]].  "He is churlish and evil... blunt in speech, rude, and even boorish in manners... The servants of Nabal say, "He is such a son of Belial [a devil] that a man cannot speak to him!' He is fond of wine and sometimes falls asleep over his cups."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|37,38}} Fielding uses Squire Western's comic character to criticize the legal system that allowed men like this to judge others because of their social position.[https://www.shmoop.com/tom-jones-book/squire-western.html] The author of Samuel uses Nabal to make similar observations of the 'leaders' of Israel.

In this same story Greenspoon finds humor in names and wordplay.  The root of Nabal's name—"n-b-l"—(and the word "fool") appears as two nouns one of which appears in the expression for "wine skin"; Nabal is a drunk. "The second noun from 'n-b-l' is a feminine form ending with the Hebrew letter [[He (letter)|he]]. With the vocalization (that is, vowels) I am thinking of, the word means carcass or corpse. Surely, Nabal was a 'dead man' when he crossed David as he did. The same consonants also make up a noun meaning 'foolishness', the very noun that Abigail used to describe her husband in her plea to David. Reading back then, we can sense a double play on words, as it were, by the narrator of this account".&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

Walker says, "The Bible reads like a rogue's gallery of unlikely heroes...  Gideon the coward, Samson the bully, David the trickster".&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|Preface:XI}} He gives the example of the powerful and popular warrior David fleeing Saul's murderous jealousy by going to Achish king of Gath, then deciding he'd made a mistake, and coping with that by faking insanity. Macy says this entire scene with David is humorous, but King Achish's response is the epitome of Biblical sarcasm: "Am I so short on insane people in my own kingdom you bring me more from other places?"&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|4}} David fools Achish--then later goes to work for him. Walker says this demonstrates "David's trickster aspect is an equal-employment jester, 'laughable for how it succeeds in duping others and how it recoils to dupe the mischiefmaker".&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|129}}

===1 Kings===
Religion Professor and Presbyterian minister [[Conrad Hyers]] finds humor in Elijah's ridicule of "the priests of Baal who wailed and slashed themselves in the hope that Baal would send fire from Heaven.  "Shout louder!...Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling; or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened!" (1 Kings 18)&lt;ref name="M.Conrad Hyers"&gt;{{cite book| last =Hyers|first=M. Conrad| title=And God Created Laughter: The Bible as Divine Comedy|date=1987|publisher=[[John Knox Press]]|location= Atlanta, Georgia|isbn=978-0-8042-1653-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

===Proverbs===
All scholars who find humor in the Bible agree it can be found in the book of Proverbs. Shutter gives numerous example such as: "A man of great anger will bear the penalty, for if you rescue him, you will only have to do it again. In other words, a man of violent temper is always getting into difficulties; you have no sooner helped him out of one than he has plunged madly into another.  Like the irascible person in the old nursery rhyme, who "jumped into a bramble bush and scratched out both his eyes", he is no sooner extricated than "with all his might and main, he jumps into another bush and puts them out again."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|11}} 
 
Shutter also says humor is often used to communicate morality claiming "Can a man take fire in his bosom And his clothes not be burned?" is a sarcastic question about adultery. Shutter includes "Wealth makes many "friends"; poverty drives them all away" and "Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts" as social satire.&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|13}}  

"All the brothers of a poor man hate him; How much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues them with words, but they are gone."  Shutter references this Proverb as humor by citing a comparison with Thackeray: "Thackeray has drawn such a picture in his more elaborate description of Harry Warrington in the sponging house, making vain appeals for help to his rich relatives and friends.  His Aunt, a member of the great and always established Church of the Pharisees, sent him her blessing--and a tract!"&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

===Ecclesiastes===
Shutter says biting Biblical humor often gives insight into human nature: "All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

===Jeremiah===
Ridicule and political commentary have gone hand in hand for many centuries. According to Shutter, when Jeremiah describes the disaster that fell on Egypt's allies, the comments that follow to the King of Egypt drip with scorn: "Pharaoh, King of Egypt, is but a noise.  He hath let the appointed time pass by."  "In the same spirit, Queen Catherine says of the dead Wolsey, "His promise was as he then was, mighty;  but his performance is as he is now, nothing."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

===Jonah=== 
Walker explains that "A crucial function of humor in the Bible is to persuade the self-righteous to laugh at themselves--a process that proves especially enlightening when the self-righteous turn out to be us.  Jonah sasses God.  Heathen Ninevites and scurrilous sailors prove more pious than the prophet [Jonah], who is subjected unceremoniously to his comeuppance." &lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|x}} Shutter points out that Jonah pouts when the Ninevites repent and are not destroyed; he yells at God, 'didn't I know this would happen?' without recognizing the irony in his own comments which is itself ironic. Shutter compares this to the character Mr. Mantalini in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]''.&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

===Esther===
Leonard Greenspoon says "Like Jonah, the book of Esther is filled with a number of plots and subplots, the humor of which is not always immediately evident."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt; The proud Haman is unaware of his comic nature, but the reader knows the very real irony that "everything Haman plans against his enemies will ultimately be done to him".&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;   

Walker finds humor in the comic reversal in Esther. The king asks one night, "What should be done for a man whom the king desires to honor?" (6:6).  Haman assumes the king means Haman himself and answers in vivid detail. He is then required to give it all to his worst enemy.  Walker also points out the pivotal role in the book of Esther is built around a female, which is a situation filled with cultural commentary and irony. Walker says, "The wit of Esther, by turning our usual expectations upside down, reminds us to expect the unexpected."&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|Preface:XI}}  He says "I second Adele Berlin's ranking of Esther high among ''the most humorous books of the Bible, amusing throughout, and at certain points uproriously funny.''  People who have looked closely find the book so funny ''Esther emerges as perhaps the clearest embodiment of the comic vision among all the Biblical narratives."&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|53}}   

Walker and Macy both cite the careful attention to words and wordplays in this book, while Walker also includes Esther in what he calls "genial gender humor" where, he says,  women often prove to be "more dynamic characters" than their male counterparts and always seem to get the "last scriptural word".&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|Preface:XI}}

Greenspoon explains "the wisdom and/or bravery exhibited by women and other "outsiders" is often expressed or acted out at the expense of those who appear to wield the most power. This is in keeping with the frequently articulated theme of biblical humor that demonstrates and reflects God's infinite ability to disrupt the plans of finite humans, especially the seemingly powerful."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

==New Testament==

Hyers says "[[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] had an unusual way of selling the gospel.  His techniques have not been widely followed...  Nor has he been hailed as a pioneer in the world of advertising.  [Paul's] term for the Christian faith is ''foolishness''.  The cross is foolishness.  Preaching is foolishness. Christians are called to be ''fools for Christ's sake''.  [[Apostles|The Apostles]] are ridiculed as fools, "a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men" (1 Cor.4:9)."&lt;ref name="M.Conrad Hyers"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Hyers says themes of divine foolishness overturning human wisdom form the plot lines of many Bible stories and such reversals are familiar in comedy as well.&lt;ref name="M.Conrad Hyers"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Macy says, "In his letters Paul reveals a robust sense of humor... He teases to teach,  uses grand exaggeration, enjoys parody and reversal, and even creates vivid comic [word] pictures."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|77}}  For example in 2 Corinthians 11, Paul uses a biting sarcasm to give what has been termed his "anti-autobiography" while calling himself a fool.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|79}}

Hyers says "[[Jesus]] freely used humor, irony and satire" and offers the examples of "the blind leading the blind; straining out a gnat, then swallowing a camel; meticulously cleaning the outside of a cup while leaving the inside filthy;  maintaining whitewashed tombs that are outwardly beautiful but inwardly full of dead men's bones; loudly honoring past prophets while plotting to kill present ones who preach the same message."&lt;ref name="M.Conrad Hyers"/&gt;{{rp|6}} These are examples of what Whedbee describes as "Jesus as the cynic sage."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|12}} Comedian [[Eric Idle]] opines that Jesus is "not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WnApCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60&amp;lpg=PT60&amp;dq=%22He's+not+particularly+funny,+what+he's+saying+isn't+mockable,+it's+very+decent+stuff%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He's+not+particularly+funny,+what+he's+saying+isn't+mockable,+it's+very+decent+stuff%22&amp;f=false|title=Jesus and Brian: Exploring the Historical Jesus and his Times via Monty Python's Life of Brian|first=Joan E.|last=Taylor|date=10 September 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|accessdate=20 September 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780567658296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical scholar [[F. F. Bruce]] finds the story of [[Rhoda (biblical figure)|Rhoda]] in [[Acts]] 12:12–15 "full of vivid humour". When Rhoda hears the voice of [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Liberation of Saint Peter|miraculously released from prison]], she becomes so happy that she forgets to open the door and let him in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kcCOAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=rhoda+%22full+of+vivid+humour%22&amp;q=%22full+of+vivid+humour%22|title=The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary|first=Frederick Fyvie|last=Bruce|date=25 April 2018|page=251|publisher=Eerdmans|accessdate=25 April 2018|quote=...now unfolds itself at the street-door of this house and inside the house is full of vivid humour.

The '''Wiccan Rede''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|d}} is a statement that provides the key moral system in the [[Neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] and certain other related [[Witchcraft]]-based faiths. A common form of the Rede is ''An’ ye harm none, do what ye will''.

The word "Rede" derives from [[Middle English]], meaning "advice" or "counsel" and being closely related to the German {{Lang|de|Rat}} or Scandinavian {{Lang|sv|råd}}. "An" is an [[Archaism|archaic]] Middle English [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], meaning "if." "[[Ye (pronoun)|Ye]]" is an archaic or dialectal form of "you" (nominative plural).

Other variants of the Rede include:
*''Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill, An it harm none do what ye will.'' Note: this is the first published form of the couplet, quoted from Doreen Valiente in 1964. Later published versions include "ye" instead of "it" (as the second word, following 'An'): "Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill – An 'ye' harm none, do what ye will" (Earth Religion News, 1974); "wilt" rather than "will": "Eight words  Wiccan Rede fulfill – An' it harm none, do what ye wilt" (Green Egg, 1975); "thou" instead of "ye" or "you", or "as" in place of "what", or any combination, e.g. "...An' (it/ye/you) harm none, do (as/what) (ye/thou/you) (wilt/will)":
*''An it harm none, do what thou wilt''
*''An it harm none, do as thou wilt''
*''That it harm none, do as thou wilt''
*''Do what you will, so long as it harms none''

== History ==
In its best known form as the "eight words" couplet, the Rede was first publicly recorded in a 1964 speech by [[Doreen Valiente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waningmoon.com/ethics/rede3.shtml |title=The Wiccan Rede: A Historical Journey – Part 3: Eight Words... |author=John J. Coughlin |date= 2 February 2002 |accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar phrase, ''Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law'', appears in [[Aleister Crowley]]'s works by 1904, in [[The Book of the Law]] (though as used by Crowley it is half of a statement and response, the response being "Love is the law, love under will"). According to B.A. Robinson of the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, Crowley adopted this line from [[François Rabelais]], who in 1534 wrote, "DO AS THOU WILT because men that are free, of gentle birth, well bred and at home in civiliz&lt;!-- sp. per source --&gt;ed company possess a natural instinct that inclines them to virtue and saves them from vice. This instinct they name their hon&lt;!-- sp. per source --&gt;or".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, B.A. "The Wiccan Rule of Behavior: The Wiccan Rede. ''Origin of the Wiccan Rede:'' Updated: 27 September 2007.

[[Pierre Louÿs|King Pausole]], a character in [[Pierre Louÿs]]' ''Les aventures du roi Pausole'' (The Adventures of King Pausole, published in 1901), issued a similar pair of edicts: ''I. — Ne nuis pas à ton voisin. II. — Ceci bien compris, fais ce qu'il te plaît.'' ("Do not harm your neighbor; this being well understood, do that which pleases you.") Although Gardner noted the similarity of the rede to King Pausole's words, [[Silver Ravenwolf]] believes it is more directly referencing Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;RavenWolf, Silver. "Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation." [[Llewellyn Worldwide]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable antecedent was put forth by the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] with his ''[[harm principle]]'' in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart. "[[On Liberty]]". 1859. Online copy available at [http://www.utilitarianism.com/ol/one.html Utilitarianism.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; "Mill argues that the sole purpose of law should be to stop people from harming others and that should people want to participate in [[victimless crime]]s, crimes with no complaining witness, such as gambling, drug usage, engaging in prostitution, then they should not be encroached in doing so."{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} In addition, the first part of the phrase is strikingly similar to the Latin maxim [[primum non nocere]] (first do no harm).

===The Long Rede===
In 1974 a complete twenty-six line poem entitled "The Wiccan Rede" was published in the neo-Pagan magazine ''Earth Religion News''. Each line contained a rhymed couplet laid out as a single line, the last line being the familiar "short rede" couplet beginning "Eight words...".

This poem was shortly followed by another, slightly different, version, entitled the "Rede Of The Wiccae", which was published in ''[[Green Egg]]'' magazine by [[Lady Gwen Thompson]]. She ascribed it to her grandmother [[Adriana Porter]], and claimed that the earlier published text was distorted from "its original form". The poem has since been very widely circulated and has appeared in other versions and layouts, with additional or variant passages. It is commonly known as the "Long Rede".

Although Thompson wrote that this version of the Rede was in its original form, this declaration is disputed for several reasons, but primarily as the language of the poem refers to Wiccan concepts that are not known to have existed in her grandmother's lifetime. It is sometime ascribed to Thompson herself. Mathiesen and Theitic concluded that 18 to 20 of the verses are lore which would be common to the area of rural 17th to 19th century New England and compiled by the hand of someone who would have been born no later that the late 19th century, and that at least six of the verses which are deemed “The Wiccan Verses” were compiled and added by a second and later hand. Since Thompson was dispensing these 26 as a whole from around 1969 it is a reasonable assumption that hers was that second hand. Another claim is that it is adapted from a speech given by [[Doreen Valiente]] at a dinner sponsored by the Witchcraft Research Association and mentioned in volume one (1964) of the Pentagram, a United Kingdom pagan newsletter then being published. Valiente did publish a poem ''The Witches Creed'' in her 1978 book, "Witchcraft for Tomorrow", which contains some similar concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Doreen Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, 1978, pages 41, 72-74 (also as noted at The Wiccan Rede: A Historical Journey)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating the Rede===
According to [[Donald H. Frew|Don Frew]], Valiente composed the couplet, following Gardner's statement that witches "are inclined to the morality of the legendary Good King Pausol, 'Do what you like so long as you harm none'"; he claims the common assumption that the Rede was copied from Crowley is misinformed, and has resulted in the words often being misquoted as "an it harm none, do what thou wilt" instead of "do what you will".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchpubs.com/books/mpex_frew.php Excerpt from Interview with Don Frew], ''Modern Pagans'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's attribution of the Long Rede to her grandmother has been disputed, since Adriana Porter died in 1946, well before [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] published ''The Old Laws'', and no evidence for Porter's authorship exists other than Thompson's word. The poem refers to Wiccan concepts that, though ostensibly very old, have not been proven to pre-date the 1940s. Its attribution to Porter may have formed part of Thompson's claim to be an [[hereditary witch]]. Its precise origin has yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waningmoon.com/ethics/rede3.shtml.|title=The Wiccan Rede: A Historical Journey – Part 3: Eight Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian Bott, in an article written in ''White Dragon'' magazine, 2003, argues that the Long Rede's creation can be placed somewhere between 1964 and 1975. Bott bases his argument on the alleged misuse of archaic English in the poem, in particular of " an' " as an abbreviation of "and", and of "ye" instead of "the". Bott states that the author of the poem was evidently unaware that this contraction of "and" is not an archaic, but a modern convention. According to Bott, in the "eight words" couplet originally cited by Valiente, "an" is used correctly, in the Middle English sense of " 'in the event that', or simply 'if' " (as in the Shakespearean "an hadst thou not come to my bed") and thus has no apostrophe. In the poem, this has been transformed into an abbreviated "and" and given an apostrophe, with every "and" in the poem's additional lines then being written " an' " as if to match. Accordingly, Bott concludes that the poem was an attempt to expand Valiente's couplet into a full Wiccan credo, written by someone who misunderstood the archaic language they attempted to imitate.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Bott, 2003. "The Wiccan Rede" in ''White Dragon'' magazine, Lughnasadh 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Mathiesen repeats Bott's objection to "ye", but argues that most other archaisms are used correctly. However, he states that they all derive from late 19th century revivalist usages.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mathiesen and Theitic, ''The Rede of the Wiccae: Adriana Porter, Gwen Thompson and the Birth of a Tradition of Witchcraft'', Olympian press, Rhode Island, 2005, pp.68–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this fact Mathiesen concludes that early twentieth century authorship of at least part of the poem is probable. He argues that its references to English folklore are consistent with Porter's family history. His provisional conclusion is that a folkloric form of the poem may have been written by Porter, but that it was supplemented and altered by Thompson to add specifically Wiccan material. Mathiessen also takes the view that the last line was probably a Thompson addition derived from Valiente. According to this account, the 1974 variant of the text, which was published by one of Thompson's former initiates, may represent one of the earlier drafts. Its publication prompted Thompson to publish what she – falsely, according to Mathiessen – claimed was Porter's "original" poem.

==Interpretations of the Rede==
The Rede is similar to a [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] formulation of the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen, Grimassi, Starhawk|first=Kirsten, Raven|title=Exploring The Pagan Path: Wisdom From The Elders|year=2005|publisher=Carrier Press|isbn=1564147886}}&lt;/ref&gt; a belief that is found in nearly every religion.{{CN|date=October 2017}} Not all traditional Wiccans follow the Rede; some [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerians]] (a sect under Wicca) espouse the [[Charge of the Goddess]] as a guide for morality. Its line ''"Keep pure your highest ideal, strive ever towards it; let naught stop you or turn you aside, for mine is the secret door which opens upon the door of youth"'' is used as a maxim for ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, Doreen. c.1953. Available Online at [http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm Ceisiwrserith.com.] Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate in the neo-Pagan and Wiccan communities as to the meaning of the Rede. The debate centres on the concept of the Rede being advice, not a commandment. The rejection of specific exhortations and prohibitions of conduct such as those given in the Judeo-Christian [[Ten Commandments]] and emphasis on the consequences of one's actions makes the Rede's character somewhat different from major religious texts such as the [[Bible]] or the [[Qur'an]]. The Rede is only a guideline which the individual must interpret to fit each particular situation and unlike most religions, which actions "do harm" (and which do not) are not discussed in the Rede. What exactly does and does not do harm is therefore open to personal interpretation.

The concept of ethical reciprocity is not explicitly stated, but most Wiccans interpret the Rede to imply the Golden Rule in the belief that the spirit of the Rede is to actively do good for one's fellow humans as well as for oneself. Different sects of Wiccans read "none" differently. "None" can apply to only the self, or it may include animals and/or plants, and so forth. In essence, the Rede can be fully understood as meaning that one should always follow their true will instead of trying to obtain simple wants and to ensure that following one's will does not harm anyone or anything. In this light, the Rede can be seen as encouraging a Wiccan to take personal responsibility for his or her actions.&lt;ref name="Ventimiglia, Mark 2003"&gt;Ventimiglia, Mark. ''Harm None''.
