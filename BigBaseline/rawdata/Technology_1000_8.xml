'''5-Tiles''' is a [[virtual keyboard]] for [[mobile device]]s with [[touchscreen]] that run the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It is characterized by needing a small amount of space leaving as much space as possible to the software that needs the keyboard. As the name indicates there are exactly five keys on the keyboard on one line of keys. [[Character (computing)|Characters]] are typed by [[Multi-touch|tap and swipe gestures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=190926|title=5-TILES Keyboard Goes Free With Beta Launch for Android|author=Lisa Devaney|date=23 September 2014|work=WebWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five keys of this keyboard all have different colors to be easily distinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/long-live-the-nav-key/|title=5-Tiles, The Software Keyboard Targeting Wearables, Picks Up Nokia’s ‘Nav Key’ Inventor As Investor|author=Steve O'Hear|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; You have the following options to type a character:
* Tap on one of the five buttons
* Swipe up or down, beginning on one of the buttons
* Swipe a path on the x-axis beginning on one of the buttons changing direction at different buttons and a different number of times—according to the character—until you finally end up on one of the buttons
* Making a [[cheat sheet]] visible with a simple swipe gesture and then tapping one of the symbols listed

The concept of this keyboard was invented in 2004. The co-founder of the company creating this keyboard, [[Michal Kubacki]], first didn't have skills in [[Computer programming|programming]]. He learned some skills that allowed him to write basic software for testing purposes and to further develop the keyboard. He got in touch with people who helped him creating the product as a virtual keyboard for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. An early version was downloaded thousands of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wearables.com/5-tiles-speeds-up-rollout-and-moves-to-free-model/|title=5-Tiles Speeds Up Rollout and Moves to Free Model|work=Wearables.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2013 [[Droidcon]] Demo Camp the company won the second place.

[[File:Child interacts with an ArtBot at 2011 show.jpg|thumb|A child interacts with a robot {{nowrap|([[ArtBots]], 2011)}}|alt=A child appears to crawl toward a tiny toy robot]]
Many scholars believe that advances in artificial intelligence will someday lead to a [[post-scarcity]] economy where intelligent machines can outperform humans in nearly every domain. The questions of what such a world might look like, and whether specific scenarios constitute [[utopias]] or [[dystopias]], are the subject of lively debate.

== Background ==
{{Further|Artificial general intelligence|Superintelligence}}

Most scientists believe that AI research will at some point lead to the creation of machines that are as intelligent, or more intelligent, than human beings in every domain of interest.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;Müller, Vincent C., and Nick Bostrom. "Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion." Fundamental issues of artificial intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2016. 553-570.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains; therefore [[superintelligence]] is physically possible.&lt;ref name=hawking&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence&amp;nbsp;– but are we taking AI seriously enough?'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence--but-are-we-taking-ai-seriously-enough-9313474.html |accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=[[The Independent (UK)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking warns artificial intelligence could end mankind|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540|accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to potential algorithmic improvements over human brains, a digital brain can be many orders of magnitude larger and faster than a human brain, which was constrained in size by evolution to be small enough to fit through a birth canal.&lt;ref name=skeptic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graves|first1=Matthew|title=Why We Should Be Concerned About Artificial Superintelligence|url=https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/why-we-should-be-concerned-about-artificial-superintelligence/|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=[[Skeptic (US magazine)]]|issue=volume 22 no. 2|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no consensus on ''when'' artificial intelligence will outperform humans, many scholars argue that whenever it does happen, the introduction of a second species of intelligent life onto the planet will have far-reaching implications.&lt;ref name=hawking/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clever cogs|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21611037-potential-impacts-intelligent-machines-human-life-clever-cogs|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=The Economist|date=9 August 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars often disagree with one another both about what types of post-AI scenarios are ''most likely'', and about what types of post-AI scenarios would be ''most desirable''. Finally, some dissenters argue that AI will never become as intelligent as humans, for example because the human race will already likely have destroyed itself before research has time to advance sufficiently to create artificial general intelligence.&lt;ref name=tegmark&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence]]|last=Tegmark|first=Max|publisher=Knopf|year=2017|isbn=9781101946596|edition=First|location=New York|chapter=Chapter 5: Aftermath: The next 10,000 years|oclc=973137375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postulates: robot labor and post-scarcity economy ==
{{Further|Post-scarcity}}
All of the following "AI aftermath scenarios" of the aftermath of arbitrarily-advanced AI development are crucially dependent on two intertwined theses. The first thesis is that, at some point in the future, some kind of economic growth will continue until a "post-scarcity" economy is reached that could, unless extremely hyperconcentrated, effortlessly provide an extremely comfortable standard of living for a population equaling or, within reason, exceeding the current human population, without even requiring the bulk of the population to participate in the workforce. This economic growth could come from the continuation of existing growth trends and the refinement of existing technologies, or through future breakthroughs in emerging technologies such as [[nanotechnology]] and automation through [[robotics]] and futuristic advanced [[artificial intelligence]]. The second thesis is that advances in artificial intelligence will render humans unnecessary for the functioning of the economy: human labor declines in relative economic value if robots are easier to cheaply mass-produce then humans, more customizable than humans, and if they become more intelligent and capable than humans.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;&lt;ref name=superintelligence&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Bostrom |date=2014 |title=[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hanson&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Robin Hanson]]|title=[[The Age of Em]]: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth|date=2016|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic endowment and limits to growth ===
The Universe may be spatially infinite; however, the accessible Universe is bounded by the [[List of cosmological horizons#Event horizon|cosmological event horizon]] of around 16 billion light years.&lt;ref&gt;Ćirković, Milan M. "Forecast for the next eon: Applied cosmology and the long-term fate of intelligent beings." Foundations of Physics 34.2 (2004): 239-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, S. Jay. "Homogeneous cosmology with aggressively expanding civilizations." Classical and Quantum Gravity 32.21 (2015): 215025.&lt;/ref&gt; Some physicists believe it plausible that nearest alien civilization may well be located more than 16 billion light years away;&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark, Max. "Our mathematical universe." Allen Lane-Penguin Books, London (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gribbin]]. ''[[Alone in the Universe (book)|Alone in the Universe]]''. New York, Wiley, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in this best-case expansion scenario, the human race could eventually, by colonizing a significant fraction of the accessible Universe, increase the accessible biosphere by perhaps 32 orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|title=Artificial intelligence: The future is superintelligent|journal=Nature|date=30 August 2017|volume=548|issue=7669|pages=520–521|doi=10.1038/548520a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twentieth century saw a partial "[[demographic transition]]" to lower birthrates associated with wealthier societies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myrskylä|first1=Mikko|last2=Kohler|first2=Hans-Peter|last3=Billari|first3=Francesco C.|title=Advances in development reverse fertility declines|journal=Nature|date=6 August 2009|volume=460|issue=7256|pages=741–743|doi=10.1038/nature08230}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the very long run, intergenerational fertility correlations (whether due to natural selection or due to cultural transmission of large-family norms from parents to children) are predicted to result in an increase in fertility over time, in the absence of either mandated birth control or periodic [[Malthusian catastrophe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolk|first1=M.|last2=Cownden|first2=D.|last3=Enquist|first3=M.|title=Correlations in fertility across generations: can low fertility persist?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=29 January 2014|volume=281|issue=1779|pages=20132561–20132561|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2561|pmc=3924067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burger|first1=Oskar|last2=DeLong|first2=John P.|title=What if fertility decline is not permanent?

== AI aftermath scenarios ==
=== Libertarianism ===
[[Libertarian transhumanism|Libertarian]] scenarios postulate that intelligent machines, uploaded humans, cyborgs, and unenhanced humans will coexist peacefully in a framework focused on respecting 
property rights. Because industrial productivity is no longer gated by scarce human labor, the value of land skyrockets compared to the price of goods; even remaining "[[Luddite#Modern usage|Luddite]]" humans who owned or inherited land should be able to sell or lease a small piece of it to the more-productive robots in exchange for a perpetual annuity sufficient to easily indefinitely meet all of their basic financial needs.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt; Such people can live as long as they choose to, and are free to engage in almost any activity they can conceive of, for pleasure or for self-actualization, without financial concern. Advanced technologies enable entirely new modes of thought and experience, thus adding to the palette of possible feelings. People in the future may even experience never-ending "gradients of bliss".&lt;ref name=religion&gt;Jordan, Gregory E. "Apologia for transhumanist religion." Journal of Evolution and Technology 15.1 (2006): 55-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Evolution moves toward greater complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and greater levels of subtle attributes such as love. In every monotheistic tradition God is likewise described as all of these qualities, only without any limitation: infinite knowledge, infinite intelligence, infinite beauty, infinite creativity, infinite love, and so on. Of course, even the accelerating growth of evolution never achieves an infinite level, but as it explodes exponentially it certainly moves rapidly in that direction. So evolution moves inexorably toward this conception of God, although never quite reaching this ideal. We can regard, therefore, the freeing of our thinking from the severe limitations of its biological form to be an essentially spiritual undertaking.&lt;ref name=religion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil, Ray. ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''. Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;|author=[[Ray Kurzweil]], author of ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''}}

Such decentralized scenarios may be unstable in the long run, as the greediest elements of the superintelligent classes would have both the means and the motive to usurp the property of the unenhanced classes. Even if the mechanisms for ensuring legal property rights are both unbreakable and loophole-free, there may still be an ever-present danger of humans and cyborgs being "tricked" by the cleverest of the superintelligent machines into unwittingly signing over their own property. Suffering may be widespread, as sentient beings without property may die, and no mechanism prevents a being from reproducing up until the limits of his own inheritable resources, resulting in a multitude of that being's descendants scrabbling out an existence of minimal sustenance.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;&lt;ref name=hanson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poole|first1=Steven|title=The Age of Em review – the horrific future when robots rule the Earth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/15/the-age-of-em-work-love-and-life-when-robots-rule-the-earth-robin-hanson-review|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=The Guardian|date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benevolent dictator===

{{Further|Friendly AI}}

In this scenario, postulate that a superintelligent artificial intelligence takes control of society, but acts in a beneficial way. Its programmers, despite being on a deadline, solved quasi-philosophical problems that had seemed to some intractable, and created an AI with the following goal: to use its superintelligence to figure out what human utopia looks like by analyzing human behavior, human brains, and human genes; and then, to implement that utopia. The AI arrives at a subtle and complex definition of human flourishing. Valuing diversity, and recognizing that different people have different preferences, the AI divides Earth into different sectors. Harming others, making weapons, evading surveillance, or trying to create a rival superintelligence are globally banned; apart from that, each sector is free to make its own laws; for example, a religious person might choose to live in the "pious sector" corresponding to his religion, where the appropriate religious rules are strictly enforced. In all sectors, disease, poverty, crime, hangovers, addiction, and all other involuntary suffering have been eliminated. Many sectors boast advanced architecture and spectacle that "make typical sci-fi visions pale in comparison".&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt; Life is an "all-inclusive pleasure cruise",&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt; as if it were "Christmas 365 days a year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artificial intelligence: can we control it?|url=https://www.ft.com/content/46d12e7c-4948-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=Financial Times|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|After spending an intense week in the knowledge sector learning about the ultimate laws of physics that the AI has discovered, you might decide to cut loose in the hedonistic sector over the weekend and then relax for a few days at the beach resort in the wildlife sector.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;|author=[[Max Tegmark]], physicist, [[MIT]]}}

Still, many people are dissatisfied. Humans have no freedom in shaping their collective destiny. Some want the freedom to have as many children as they want. Others resent surveillance by the AI, or chafe at bans on weaponry and on creating further superintelligence machines. Others may come to regret the choices they have made, or find their lives feel hollow and superficial.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;

===Gatekeeper AI===
In "Gatekeeper" AI scenarios, the AI can act to prevent rival superintelligences from being created, but otherwise errs on the side of allowing humans to create their own destiny.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt; [[Ben Goertzel]] of [[OpenCog]] has advocated a "Nanny AI" scenario where the AI additionally takes some responsibility for preventing humans from destroying themselves, for example by slowing down technological progress to give time for society to advance in a more thoughtful and deliberate manner.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goertzel, Ben. "Should humanity build a global AI nanny to delay the singularity until it’s better understood?" Journal of consciousness studies 19.1-2 (2012): 96-111.&lt;/ref&gt; In a third scenario, a superintelligent "Protector" AI gives humans the illusion of control, by hiding or erasing all knowledge of its existence, but works behind the scenes to guarantee positive outcomes. In all three scenarios, while humanity gains more control (or at least the illusion of control), humanity ends up progressing more slowly than it would if the AI were unrestricted in its willingness to rain down all the benefits of its advanced technology on the human race.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;

===Boxed AI===
[[File:Opened up a Pandora's box.jpg|thumb|''Pandora's box''&lt;br/&gt;(19th century engraving)|alt=Pandora attempts to close the box]]
{{Further|AI box}}
{{quote|People ask what is the relationship between humans and machines, and my answer is that it's very obvious: Machines are our slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Jeopardy! Robot Watson Grows Up, How Afraid of It Should We Be?|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/jeopardy-robot-watson.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=[[New York Magazine]]|date=20 May 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=[[Thomas G. Dietterich|Tom Dietterich]], president of the [[AAAI]]}}

The AI Box scenario postulates that a superintelligent AI can be "confined to a box" and its actions can be restricted by human gatekeepers; the humans in charge would try to take advantage of some of the AI's scientific breakthroughs or reasoning abilities, without allowing the AI to take over the world. Successful gatekeeping may be difficult; the more intelligent the AI is, the more likely the AI can find a clever way to use "[[social hacking]]" and convince the gatekeepers to let it escape, or even to find an unforeseen physical method of escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Control dangerous AI before it controls us, one expert says|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46590591/ns/technology_and_science-innovation|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=NBC News|date=1 March 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vinge|first1=Vernor|title=The coming technological singularity: How to survive in the post-human era|journal=Vision-21: Interdisciplinary science and engineering in the era of cyberspace|date=1993|pages=11–22|quote=I argue that confinement is intrinsically impractical.

===Human-AI merger===
Kurzweil argues that in the future "There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists: Humans and machines will merge in future|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/07/15/bio.tech/index.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=www.cnn.com|date=15 July 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human extinction===
{{Main|AI takeover|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}

If a dominant superintelligent machine were to conclude that human survival is an unnecessary risk or a waste of resources, the result would be human extinction. This could occur if a machine, programmed without respect for human values, unexpectedly gains superintelligence through recursive self-improvement, or manages to escape from its containment in an AI Box scenario. This could also occur if the first superintelligent AI was programmed with an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of human values, either because the task of instilling the AI with human values was too difficult or impossible; due to a buggy initial implementation of the AI; or due to bugs accidentally being introduced, either by its human programmers or by the self-improving AI itself, in the course of refining its code base. Bostrom and others argue that human extinction is probably the "default path" that society is currently taking, in the absence of substantial preparatory attention to AI safety. The resultant AI might not be sentient, and might place no value on sentient life; the resulting hollow world, devoid of life, might be like "a Disneyland without children".&lt;ref name=superintelligence/&gt;

[[Jerry Kaplan]], author of ''[[Humans Need Not Apply]]'', posits a scenario where humans are farmed or kept on a reserve, just as humans preserve endangered species like chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wakefield|first1=Jane|title=Do we really need to fear AI?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32334568|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=BBC News|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple co-founder and AI skeptic [[Steve Wozniak]] stated in 2015 that robots taking over would actually "be good for the human race", on the grounds that he believes humans would become the robots' pampered pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says humans will be robots' pets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says-humans-will-be-robots-pets|accessdate=7 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to AI ==
Some scholars doubt that "game-changing" superintelligent machines will ever come to pass. [[Gordon Bell]] of [[Microsoft Research]] has stated "the population will destroy itself before the [[technological singularity]]". [[Gordon Moore]], discoverer of the eponymous [[Moore's law]], stated "I am a skeptic. I don't believe this kind of thing is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way." Evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] stated, "The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tech Luminaries Address Singularity|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/tech-luminaries-address-singularity|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News|date=1 June 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Joy]] of [[Sun Microsystems]], in his April 2000 essay ''[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]'', has advocated for global "voluntary relinquishment" of artificial general intelligence and other risky technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us|url=https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=WIRED|date=1 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The mouse pad that roared|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-mouse-pad-that-roared-3069815.php|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=SFGate|date=14 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most experts believe relinquishment is extremely unlikely. AI skeptic [[Oren Etzioni]] has stated that researchers and scientists have no choice but to push forward with AI developments: "China says they want to be an AI leader, Putin has said the same thing. So the global race is on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk says AI could doom human civilization. Zuckerberg disagrees.

The '''Cebu IT Park''' (formerly known as '''''Asiatown IT Park''''') is a 27-hectare mixed use [[business park]] in [[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]], envisioned to attract locators in the [[information technology]] services. It is developed by ''Cebu Property Ventures and Development Corporation'', a subsidiary of Cebu Holdings, Inc.

==General operations==
Tenants include [[Bombardier Inc.|Cebu Bombardier]], [[NEC]], SPI Tech, [[1&amp;1 Internet|1&amp;1 Internet Philippines, Inc.]], [[Aegis Limited (BPO)|Aegis]] (now acquired by [[Teleperformance]]), [[Convergys]] (who later acquired both [[eTelecare]] and [[Stream Global Services|Stream]]), [[Qualfon]], Promotional USB, [[Accenture]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Xlibris]]/[[Author Solutions]], [[JP Morgan Chase]], and [[Epson]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everythingcebu.com/cebu-profile-basic-info/cebu-city%E2%80%99s-asiatown-i-t-park/&lt;/ref&gt; The main infrastructures found at the park are i1, i2, i3, E-BLOC, TGU Tower, PIPC 15, Skyrise 3, Skyrise 2, Skyrise 1, E-Office One, PIPC 11, PIPC 14, Globe IT, Aegis Tower, the CJRS and The Central Bloc.

In January 2010, [[IBM]] inaugurated its 2nd Global Delivery Center at TGU Tower.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-07.ibm.com/ph/city/cebu/#overlay-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=545560&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=108{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM established its initial presence in the Philippines in 1937. In 2007, IBM partnered with the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Philippines Department of Science and Technology]] on the Philippine Intellectual Property Policy Strategy, Engineering Research &amp; Development for Technology Program, and the National Technology Business Incubators Program. IBM Philippines Country General Manager James Velasquez said the company recognizes Cebu as the gateway both for its domestic clients in the Visayas and Mindanao, as well as overseas clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/241142/ibm-open |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106202113/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/241142/ibm-open |archivedate=2010-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was approved by the [[Philippine Economic Zone Authority]] (PEZA) board as an economic zone on April 6, 2000. On February 27, 2001, Presidential Proclamation No. 12 made it an Information Technology [[Special Economic Zone]].

Construction on eOffice One, the first office modules in Cebu IT Park, began in 2001 and opened in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cebuholdings.com/images/milestone.jpg{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[35&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;film]] [[film gauge|gauge]] has long been the most common gauge in professional usage, and thus enjoys the greatest number of cameras currently available for professional usage. The modern era of 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras dates to 1972, when [[Arri]]'s [[Arriflex 35BL]] and [[Panavision]]'s original [[Panaflex]] models emerged as the first self-blimped, lightweight cameras. Another distinguishing characteristic of modern cameras is the adoption of stronger [[lens mount]] seatings secured with a [[breech lock]] – namely the [[Arri PL]] and [[PV mount]], both of which were designs descended from the [[BNCR mount]] of Mitchell cameras.

===General===
* '''Camera model''' – specific camera body models and variants, usually officially authorized
* '''Camera line''' – either the body family (similar bodies) or system family (complementary design)
* '''Manufacturer''' – company of origin
* '''Introduced''' – first year of known usage
* '''Weight''' – usually just the body, but may include accessories as mentioned
* '''MOS/Sync''' – Sync-sound cameras are able to both maintain a constant speed (usually [[crystal oscillator|crystal lock]]) and run quietly enough not to be heard by the sound recordist. [[MOS (film)|MOS]] cameras do not meet either one or both of these requirements, and are usually used either for applications where camera noise is not a concern, or non-standard camera speeds are required. A camera is also deemed MOS if it cannot hold a constant speed, regardless of its noise levels.
* '''Noise level''' – measured noise made by the camera, dB(A), with film and at a given distance from the film plane, usually one meter. MOS cameras do not have a measured noise level since they are not intended to be used with recorded sound and thus are much louder.

:''A limited number of cameras prior to the modern period are listed due to their prevalence in special applications.''

===Lens and gate aperture===
* '''Lens mount''' – the type of [[lens mount|mount]] required for using the camera. Certain lenses may not be able to be used with particular cameras if the mounts are incompatible. The lens mount must be shifted to be centered to accommodate the Super 16 format from standard 16.
* '''Aperture size''' – the size of the aperture of the gate.
* '''Aperture plate''' – is the gate removable for inspection and what accessories may it have?
* '''Lens interface''' – electronic information system located in the lens mount to communicate lens data to the camera and accessories.
* '''Ground glass''' – interchangeable [[ground glass]]es allow for the viewfinder to display whichever [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] is being framed for.
* '''Frameline glow''' – can the camera make the framelines glow for easier viewing in low-light conditions?

===Shutter===
* '''Reflex''' – is the shutter a [[reflex mirror]] design?
* '''Design''' – [[rotary disc shutter]]s have two common designs – a "half-moon" disc of 180° or "butterfly" of two e.g. 90° segments opposite each other which spin at half-speed.
* '''Location''' – where the shutter is centered
* '''Adjustment''' – how the shutter angle can be adjusted. Most manual designs can only be adjusted when the camera is not running, often with the lens removed. All electronic shutters allow adjustment at all times, including when the camera is running.
* '''Angles''' – shutter angles available and in what increments or stops, if not continuous.

===Movement===
* '''Movement type''' – design of the movement mechanism
* '''Pulldown claws''' – number of claws which engage the [[film perforations]] to transport the film while the shutter is closed. Some claws may have more than one pin in order to engage multiple perfs at a time.
* '''Registration pins''' – number of pins which engage the film perforations during exposure in order to ensure consistent image stability from frame to frame.
* '''Frame rate (forward)''' – range of speeds in frame/s (frames per second) and smallest increments of change allowed. Accessories noted where required for certain speeds.
* '''Frame rate (reverse)''' – range of speeds in frame/s (frames per second) and smallest increments of change allowed. Accessories noted where required for certain speeds.
* '''Motor''' – type of motor, voltage, crystal-controlled speeds ([[Crystal oscillator|Xtal]])
* '''Pulldown''' – [[negative pulldown]] options available
* '''Pitch control?''' – does the camera allow for adjustment of the pulldown claw to optimize camera noise and avoid perforation damage?

==16 mm==
[[16 mm film]] occupies a rather curious position within filmmaking – with a wide range encompassing virtually every field – amateur home movies, student films, experimental films, television work, commercials, music videos, corporate films, industrial research, medical applications, and lower budget features. Its robust image quality in relation to its size allows for a much more versatile, accessible, and affordable usage in many fields where neither 35&amp;nbsp;mm nor [[Super 8 mm film|Super&amp;nbsp;8]] would be well-suited. Despite current challenges from the burgeoning digital video market, the consistent improvement of cameras, lenses, and film stocks have enabled the [[16 mm film|Super&amp;nbsp;16]] format to flourish recently, with many labs reporting increased usage. The modern era of 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras is concurrent with that of 35&amp;nbsp;mm for both the same reasons as 35&amp;nbsp;mm as well as an additional change: the creation of the Super 16 format by Rune Ericsson in 1971. The format expanded the usable film negative horizontally, which required a larger [[film gate]] and necessitated either specialized conversion of machined parts or purchase of new cameras designed with Super 16 gates. Since the format took more than a decade to slowly standardize, the competition from both high and low end video cameras has decimated the demand for 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras for most non-professional usage. Therefore, there are relatively few Super 16 cameras, although most are considered professional-grade.

'''Digital detox''' refers to a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic connecting devices such as smartphones and computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/digital_detox|title=digital detox {{!}} Definition of digital detox in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as an opportunity to reduce stress, focus more on social interaction and connection with nature in the physical world. Claimed benefits include increased [[mindfulness]], lowered anxiety, and an overall better appreciation of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/digital-detox_n_5589474|title=Here's One Big Sign It's Time To Reevaluate Your Relationship With Your Phone|date=2014-07-16|work=HuffPost|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francesbooth/2014/06/13/how-to-do-a-digital-detox/#67da105b65a4|title=How To Do A Digital Detox|last=Booth|first=Frances|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;There have been many stories where a digital detox has lead to a more refreshed feeling along the people involved. They described there digital detox as a "getaway" in some aspect. When people get caught up in how much they need to do, the overuse of technology becomes prevalent. This even becomes the case in a social context; people want to make sure they're up to date on the latest news stories, Instagram posts, political tweets etc. and to do this, they need to stay plugged in. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brown, Sally (Feb 2014). "Switch off: feel chained to your smartphone? Perhaps you're in need of a digital detox" (PDF). ''sallybrowntherapy.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphones, laptops, and tablets, combined with the increasing wireless Internet accessibility, enable technology users to constantly be connected to the digital world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Morrison, S., &amp; Gomez, R. (2014). "Pushback: The Growth of Expressions of Resistance to Constant Online Connectivity" (PDF). In iConference 2014 Proceedings (p. 1-15).&lt;/ref&gt;Constant online connectivity may have a negative impact on the users’ experience with electronic connecting devices and result in a wish to temporarily refrain from communication technology usage.

In one study in Mind, 95% of those interviewed said their mood improved after putting down their phones to spend time outside, changing from depressed, stressed, and anxious to more calm and balanced. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/enhance-your-wellbeing/environment/nature-and-us/how-does-nature-impact-our-wellbeing|title=How Does Nature Impact Our Wellbeing? {{!}} Taking Charge of Your Health &amp; Wellbeing|website=Taking Charge of Your Health &amp; Wellbeing|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivations behind digital detoxing vary. In some cases, the motivation is negative emotional responses to the technology usage, such as dissatisfaction or disappointment of the technology device and its functions. In other cases, users see the technology as a distracting factor that consumes time and energy and wants to take back control over their everyday lives. Some people have moral, ethical or political reasons to refrain from technology usage. Furthermore, a concern of developing addictive behavior in terms of tech addiction or [[Internet addiction disorder]] is one of the motivations for disconnecting for a period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;This excessive technology usage can be considered an addiction. It's said that around 50% of smartphone users check their account 5 minutes prior to going to bed and within 5 minutes post waking up. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adgully.com/smartphone-owners-increasingly-obsessed-with-their-devices-deloitte-study-63842.html|title=Smartphone owners in India are increasingly obsessed with their devices: Deloitte Mobile Consumer Survey 2015|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant engagement with digital connecting devices at the workplace is claimed to lead to increased stress levels and reduce productivity. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ayyagari|first=Ramakrishna|last2=Grover|first2=Varun|last3=Purvis|first3=Russell|date=2011|title=Technostress: Technological Antecedents and Implications|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41409963|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=35|issue=4|pages=831–858|doi=10.2307/41409963}}&lt;/ref&gt;Certain characteristics of the technology make it more difficult to distinguish work from leisure. Moreover, being continually connected increases the number of interruptions at work. Allowing employees to disconnect for a part of the day in order to truly focus on their work without disturbance from colleagues is claimed to be beneficial to the productivity and work environment. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''To combat the effects of constant digital exposure, there are digital detox retreats held for select numbers of people. It's an average of 12 people per week getting detoxed for a little less than $600 dollars including flights.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In certain cultures, constant work is encouraged and taking breaks are sometimes even discouraged. This is due to the idea that a break equals a lack of productivity. In the Indian culture, this is extremely prevalent; there have even been studies to back these ideas up. It's said that more than half of Indians check their work and social emails constantly. Even while vacationing, about 30% admitted that they had an irresistible urge to check and post on social media. There is also a significant estimated 30% difference between people being willing to leave their laptops at home compared to people being willing to leave their smartphones at home. It's admitted that if work wasn't a factor a lot of Indians wouldn't constantly be on their devices and stay unplugged. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcquest.com/time-digital-detox/|title=Time for Digital Detox - PCQuest|date=2018-01-10|work=PCQuest|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connecting devices’ multitasking character has a serious impact on the learning ability. Multitasking implies operating on a surface level, which only involves the short-time memory. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10540261/screen-time-ipad-tablet-digital-detox-difital-addiction.html|title=Switch off – it’s time for your digital detox|last=Smith|first=Julia Llewellyn|date=2013-12-28|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;Using multiple connecting devices as learning platforms is therefore not beneficial. A reduction of information choices enables the brain to focus more on the quality of the information rather than the hastiness of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/9_1/brabazon9_1.html|title=Time for a digital detox? - Tara Brabazon - Fast Capitalism 9.1|website=www.uta.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DocBook''' is a [[Semantics (computer science)|semantic]] [[markup language]] for technical [[documentation]]. It was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docbook.org/whatis What is DocBook?]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a semantic language, DocBook enables its users to create [[separation of presentation and content|document content in a presentation-neutral form]] that captures the logical structure of the content; that content can then be published in a variety of formats, including [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], [[EPUB]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Manual page (Unix)|man pages]], [[Web help]]&lt;ref name="webhelp-1.76.1"&gt;[http://blog.kasunbg.org/2010/08/docbook-webhelp-project.html DocBook WebHelp Project]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|HTML Help]], without requiring users to make any changes to the source. In other words, when a document is written in DocBook format it becomes easily portable into other formats. It solves the problem of reformatting by writing it once using XML tags.

== Design ==

DocBook is an [[XML]] language. In its current version (5.x), DocBook's language is formally defined by a [[RELAX NG]] [[XML schema|schema]] with integrated [[Schematron]] rules. (There are also [[W3C XML Schema]]+Schematron and [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) versions of the schema available, but these are considered non-standard.)

As a semantic language, DocBook documents do not describe what their contents "look like", but rather the ''meaning'' of those contents. For example, rather than explaining how the [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] for an article might be visually formatted, DocBook simply says that a particular section ''is'' an abstract. It is up to an external processing tool or application to decide where on a page the abstract should go and what it should look like or whether or not it should be included in the final output at all.

DocBook provides a vast number of semantic element tags. They are divided into three broad categories: structural, block-level, and inline.

''Structural'' tags specify broad characteristics of their contents. The &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; element, for example, specifies that its child elements represent the parts of a book. This includes a title, chapters, glossaries, appendices, and so on. DocBook's structural tags include, but are not limited to:

* ''&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of one or more &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;s or &lt;code&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt;s, can be nested with other sets
* ''&lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of &lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;s, and/or &lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt;s, with optional glossaries, appendices, etc.
* ''&lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of one or more &lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;s—can be nested with other parts, and may have special introductory text
* ''&lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled, unnumbered collection of block-level elements
* ''&lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled, numbered collection of block-level elements—chapters don't require explicit numbers, a chapter number is the number of previous chapter elements in the XML document plus 1
* ''&lt;code&gt;appendix&lt;/code&gt;:'' Contains text that represents an [[Addendum|appendix]]
* ''&lt;code&gt;dedication&lt;/code&gt;:'' Text represents the dedication of the contained structural element

Structural elements can contain other structural elements. Structural elements are the only permitted top-level elements in a DocBook document.

''Block-level'' tags are elements like paragraph, lists, etc. Not all these elements can directly contain text. Sequential block-level elements render one "after" another. After, in this case, can differ depending on the language. In most Western languages, "after" means below: text paragraphs are printed down the page. Other languages' [[Writing system#Directionality|writing systems can have different directionality]]; for example, in Japanese, paragraphs are often printed in downward columns, with the columns running from right to left, so "after" in that case would be to the left. DocBook semantics are entirely neutral to these kinds of language-based concepts.

''Inline-level'' tags are elements like emphasis, hyperlinks, etc. They wrap text within a block-level element. These elements do not cause the text to break when rendered in a paragraph format, but typically they cause the document processor to apply some kind of distinct typographical treatment to the enclosed text, by changing the font, size, or similar attributes. (The DocBook specification ''does'' say that it expects different typographical treatment, but it does not offer specific requirements as to what this treatment may be.) That is, a DocBook processor doesn't have to transform an &lt;code&gt;emphasis&lt;/code&gt; tag into ''italics''. A reader-based DocBook processor could increase the size of the words, or, a text-based processor could use bold instead of italics.

=== Sample document ===

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
 &lt;book xml:id="simple_book" xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0"&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Very simple book&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;chapter xml:id="chapter_1"&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;Hello world!&lt;/para&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;I hope that your day is proceeding &lt;emphasis&gt;splendidly&lt;/emphasis&gt;!&lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;/chapter&gt;
   &lt;chapter xml:id="chapter_2"&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;Hello again, world!&lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;/chapter&gt;
 &lt;/book&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Semantically, this document is a "book", with a "title", that contains two "chapters" each with their own "titles". Those "chapters" contain "paragraphs" that have text in them. The markup is fairly readable in English.

In more detail, the root element of the document is &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;. All DocBook elements are in an [[XML Namespace]], so the root element has an ''xmlns'' attribute to set the current namespace. Also, the root element of a DocBook document must have a ''version'' that specifies the version of the format that the document is built on.

(XML documents can include elements from multiple namespaces at once. For simplicity, the example does not illustrate this.)

A &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; element must contain a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, or an &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; element containing a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;. This must be before any child structural elements. Following the title are the structural children, in this case, two &lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt; elements. Each of these must have a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;. They contain &lt;code&gt;para&lt;/code&gt; block elements, which can contain free text and other inline elements like the &lt;code&gt;emphasis&lt;/code&gt; in the second paragraph of the first chapter.

=== Schemas and validation ===

Rules are formally defined in the DocBook [[XML schema]]. Appropriate programming tools can validate an XML document (DocBook or otherwise), against its corresponding schema, to determine if (and where) the document fails to conform to that schema. XML editing tools can also use schema information to avoid creating non-conforming documents in the first place.

== Authoring and processing ==

Because DocBook is XML, documents can be created and edited with any text editor. A dedicated [[XML editor]] is likewise a functional DocBook editor. DocBook provides [[XML schema|schema files]] for popular XML schema languages, so any XML editor that can provide content completion based on a schema can do so for DocBook. Many [[XML editor#Graphical editors|graphical]] or [[WYSIWYG]] [[XML editor#WYSIWYG editors|XML editors]] come with the ability to edit DocBook like a [[word processor]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Because DocBook conforms to a well-defined XML schema, documents can be validated and processed using any tool or programming language that includes XML support.

== History ==

DocBook began in 1991 in discussion groups on [[Usenet]] and eventually became a joint project of [[HAL Computer Systems]] and [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly &amp; Associates]] and eventually spawned its own maintenance organization (the Davenport Group) before moving in 1998 to the ''SGML Open'' consortium, which subsequently became [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]. DocBook is currently maintained by the ''DocBook Technical Committee'' at OASIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/ch01.html Getting Started with DocBook]&lt;/ref&gt;

DocBook is available in both [[SGML]] and [[XML]] forms, as a [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]. [[RELAX NG]] and [[W3C XML Schema]] forms of the XML version are available. Starting with DocBook 5, the RELAX NG version is the "normative" form from which the other formats are generated.

DocBook originally started out as an SGML application, but an equivalent XML application was developed and has now replaced the [[SGML]] one for most uses. (Starting with version 4 of the SGML DTD, the XML DTD continued with this version numbering scheme.) Initially, a key group of software companies used DocBook since their representatives were involved in its initial design. Eventually, however, DocBook was adopted by the open source community where it has become a standard for creating documentation for many projects, including [[FreeBSD]], [[KDE]], [[GNOME]] desktop documentation, the [[GTK+]] [[Application programming interface|API]] references, the [[Linux kernel]] documentation, and the work of the [[Linux Documentation Project]].

=== Pre DocBook v5.0 ===

Until DocBook 5, DocBook was defined normatively by a Document Type Definition (DTD). Because DocBook was built originally as an application of [[SGML]], the DTD was the only available schema language. DocBook 4.x formats can be SGML or XML, but the XML version does not have its own namespace.

DocBook 4.x formats had to live within the restrictions of being defined by a DTD. The most significant restriction was that an element name uniquely defines its possible contents. That is, an element named &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; must contain the same information no matter where it is in the DocBook file. As such, there are many kinds of info elements in DocBook 4.x: &lt;code&gt;bookinfo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chapterinfo&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Each has a slightly different content model, but they do share some of their content model. Additionally, they repeat context information. The book's &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; element is that, because it is a direct child of the book; it does not need to be named specially for a human reader. However, because the format was defined by a DTD, it did have to be named as such. The root element does not have or need a ''version'', as the version is built into the DTD declaration at the top of a pre-DocBook 5 document.

DocBook 4.x documents are not compatible with DocBook 5, but can be converted into DocBook 5 documents via an XSLT stylesheet. One (&lt;code&gt;db4-upgrade.xsl&lt;/code&gt;) is provided as part of the distribution of the DocBook 5 schema and specification package.&lt;ref&gt;Jirka Kosek, Norman Walsh, Dick Hamilton, and Michael Smith, ''DocBook V5.0: The Transition Guide'', 16 June 2009, [http://docbook.org/docs/howto/#convert4to5 Converting DocBook V4.x documents to DocBook V5.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Output formats ==

DocBook files are used to prepare output files in a wide variety of formats. Nearly always, this is accomplished using [[DocBook XSL]] stylesheets. These are [[XSLT]] stylesheets that transform DocBook documents into a number of formats ([[HTML]], [[XSL-FO]] for later conversion into [[PDF]], etc.). These stylesheets can be sophisticated enough to generate tables of contents, glossaries, and indexes. They can oversee the selection of particular designated portions of a master document to produce different versions of the same document (such as a "tutorial" or a "quick-reference guide", where each of these consist of a subset of the material). Users can write their own customized stylesheets or even a full-fledged program to process the DocBook into an appropriate output format as their needs dictate.

Norman Walsh and the DocBook Project development team maintain the key application for producing output from DocBook source documents: A set of [[Extensible Stylesheet Language|XSL]] stylesheets (as well as a legacy set of [[DSSSL]] stylesheets) that can generate high-quality [[HTML]] and print ([[XSL Formatting Objects|FO]]/[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]) output, as well as output in other formats, including [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[man page]]s and HTML Help.

[[Web help]]&lt;ref name=webhelp-1.76.1 /&gt; is a chunked HTML output format in the [[DocBook XSL]] stylesheets that was introduced in version 1.76.1. The documentation for web help&lt;ref&gt;[http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/webhelp/docs/index.html Web help documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; also provides an example of web help and is part of the DocBook XSL distribution.

The major features are its fully CSS-based page layout, search of the help content, and a table of contents in collapsible-tree form. Search has [[stemming]], match highlighting, explicit page-scoring, and the standard multilingual [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenizer]]. The search and TOC are in a pane that appears as a [[Frameset (HTML)|frameset]], but is actually implemented with [[div and span|div tags]] and cookies (so that it is progressive).

This web help format was originally implemented by Kasun Gajasinghe as part of the Google Summer of Code 2010 program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.docbook.org/WebHelp Web help DocBook wiki page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplified DocBook ==

DocBook offers a large number of features that may be overwhelming to a new user. For those who want the convenience of DocBook without a steep learning curve, ''Simplified DocBook'' was designed. It is a small subset of DocBook designed for single documents such as articles or white papers (i.e., "books" are not supported). The Simplified DocBook DTD is currently at version 1.1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docbook.org/schemas/sdocbook/ Simplified DocBook]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drexler-Smalley cover.jpg|thumb|The debate between [[K. Eric Drexler]] and [[Richard Smalley]] on the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s began in 2001 and concluded in a cover story in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in 2003.]]

The '''Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology''' was a public dispute between [[K. Eric Drexler]], the originator of the conceptual basis of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[Richard Smalley]], a recipient of the 1996 [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the [[nanomaterial]] [[buckminsterfullerene]]. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing [[molecular assembler]]s, which are [[molecular machine]]s which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.

The debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and [[open letter]]s. It began with a 2001 article by Smalley in ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was followed by a [[Counterargument|rebuttal]] published by Drexler and coworkers later that year, and two open letters by Drexler in early 2003. The debate was concluded in late 2003 in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in which both parties participated.

The debate has been often cited in the [[history of nanotechnology]] due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to go so far as to characterize the tone of the debate as similar to "a [[pissing contest|pissing match]]"&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "reminiscent of [a] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Yes, They Can!

==The participants==

===K. Eric Drexler===
[[File:Eric Drexler 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].]]

{{main|K. Eric Drexler}}

K. Eric Drexler is generally considered to have written the first scholarly paper on the topic of nanotechnology,&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelesko |first=John A. |title=Self-assembly: the science of things that put themselves together |year=2007 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58488-687-7 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work.&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toumey|first=Christopher|title=Reading Feynman into nanotechnology: a text for a new science|journal=Techné|date=Fall 2008|volume=12|issue=3|page=133–168|doi=10.5840/techne20081231|url=http://litsciarts.org/slsa08/slsa08-650.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in [[molecular biology]] such as [[recombinant DNA]] technology. In a 1981 publication in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the [[ribosome]] were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work ''Nanosystems'' in 1992. He also co-founded the [[Foresight Institute]], a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"&gt;Edwards, pp. 15–21, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler's vision of nanotechnology, now called [[molecular nanotechnology]], is based on the concept of the [[molecular assembler]], a [[molecular machine]] which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between [[wet nanotechnology]] based on biological systems, and "second-generation" dry nanotechnology which would be based on [[mechanosynthesis]], positional control of molecules through principles more related to [[mechanical engineering]]. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"/&gt;

===Richard Smalley===
[[File:Richard Smalley.jpg|thumb|250px|Richard Smalley won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with [[Harry Kroto]] and [[Robert Curl]] for their 1985 discovery of [[buckminsterfullerene]].]]

{{main|Richard Smalley}}

Richard E. Smalley, a chemist at [[Rice University]], was best known as a co-discoverer of the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[Allotropes of carbon|form of carbon]] known as [[buckminsterfullerene]] in 1985, along with [[Harry Kroto]], [[Robert Curl]], [[James R. Heath|James Heath]], and [[Sean O'Brien (scientist)|Sean O'Brien]]. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be discovered of the class of molecules known as [[fullerenes]], which also includes [[carbon nanotube]]s. The study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of the fields of [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanoelectronics]], and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 27, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley had also taken a prominent [[public policy]] role in relation to nanotechnology, and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to the world's energy and health problems, for example raising the possibility of [[Energy applications of nanotechnology|using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission]], and of developing [[Nanomedicine|nanomaterial-based drugs]] for [[targeted drug delivery]]. Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology [[Startup company|startups]]. Smalley died of [[leukemia]] in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 132, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berube"/&gt;

==The debate==

===Smalley's ''Scientific American'' article===
[[File:Drexler-Smalley SciAm cover.png|thumb|Smalley's 2001 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article doubting the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s led to a rebuttal by Drexler and his colleagues.]]

Smalley wrote an article, "Of Chemistry, Love, and Nanobots", for the September 2001 issue of the [[popular science]] magazine ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was a special issue on the topic of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley |pmid=11524973| volume=285| issue=3| pages=76–7| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms:

{{Quote|When a boy and a girl fall in love, it is often said that the chemistry between them is good. This common use of the word "chemistry" in human relations comes close to the subtlety of what actually happens in the more mundane coupling of molecules. In a chemical reaction between two 'consenting' molecules, bonds form between some of the atoms in what is usually a complex dance involving motion in multiple dimensions.... And if the chemistry is really, really good, the molecules that do react will all produce the exact product required.}}

He referenced the idea of a [[molecular assembler]], a [[nanorobot]] capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one [[Mole (chemistry)|mole]] of material, but [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a [[grey goo]] scenario, or, referring to [[Bill Joy]]'s previous article "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", that the nanorobots could develop [[swarm intelligence]] and become alive in some sense.

Smalley then considered how realistic the concept of a self-replicating nanorobot was. He noted that in a chemical reaction, the [[chemical bond]]s are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity. He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work, and would thus have to have many manipulator arms. This led him to raise two objections to the concept of molecular assembler, which he called the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem":

{{Quote|Because the fingers of a manipulator arm must themselves be made out of atoms, they have a certain irreducible size. There just isn't enough room in the nanometer-size reaction region to accommodate all the fingers of all the manipulators necessary to have complete control of the chemistry.... [Also,] the atoms of the manipulator hands will adhere to the atom that is being moved. So it will often be impossible to release this minuscule building block in precisely the right spot. Both these problems are fundamental, and neither can be avoided. Self-replicating, mechanical nanobots are simply not possible in our world.}}

Smalley closed the article by returning to the analogy of chemistry as a dance of love, remarking that "you don't make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together."

===Drexler's response===

Bottom, a schematic of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]], which Drexler cited as being able to manipulate individual molecules via [[Mechanosynthesis|positional control]].|alt1=Ribosome schematic|alt2=Scanning tunneling microscope schematic}}

Drexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through the [[Institute for Molecular Manufacturing]], which was co-authored with others including [[Robert Freitas]], [[J. Storrs Hall]], and [[Ralph Merkle]].&lt;ref name="drexlerresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=On Physics, Fundamentals, and Nanorobots: A Rebuttal to Smalley’s Assertion that Self-Replicating Mechanical Nanorobots Are Simply Not Possible |publisher=Institute for Molecular Manufacturing |year=2001 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |first1=K. Eric |last1=Drexler |first2=David |last2=Forrest |first3=Robert A. |last3=Freitas |first4=J. Storrs |last4=Hall |first5=Neil |last5=Jacobstein |first6=Tom |last6=McKendree |first7=Ralph |last7=Merkle |first8=Christine |last8=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors first discussed the "fat fingers" argument by attacking Smalley's notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one of which can be immobilized and the other attached to a single "finger". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the "sticky fingers" problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem.

The authors put forth the [[ribosome]] as an example of a natural molecular machine; because the ribosome suffers from neither problem, they must not be fundamental, saying:

{{Quote|This ubiquitous biological molecular assembler suffers from neither the “fat finger” nor the “sticky finger” problem. If, as Smalley argues, both problems are “fundamental,” then why would they prevent the development of mechanical assemblers and not biological assemblers? If the class of molecular structures known as proteins can be synthesized using positional techniques, then why would we expect there to be no other classes of molecular structures that can be synthesized using positional techniques?}}

The authors also questioned Smalley's figures for the replication time of nanomachines. Instead of Smalley's figure of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz for the atomic placement frequency, they point out that ''Nanosystems'' suggested a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, a thousand times slower, and that at Smalley's higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds. The authors called this a [[straw man]] argument, writing that "in a serious scientific discussion, a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal."  The authors closed by stating that the best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work, and that "there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome, but thus far, there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible."

Drexler followed up with two open letters to Smalley in April and July 2003. The April letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=An Open Letter on Assemblers|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; began, "I have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work."  Drexler accused Smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what Drexler now calls "Smalley fingers", which he stated to be unlike the enzyme-like systems he had actually proposed. He asserted:

{{Quote|The impossibility of "Smalley fingers" has raised no concern in the research community because these fingers solve no problems and thus appear in no proposals. Your reliance on this straw-man attack might lead a thoughtful observer to suspect that no one has identified a valid criticism of my work. For this I should, perhaps, thank you.}}

Drexler compared the nanotechnology debate's importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before [[Sputnik]] or to theoretical work on [[nuclear chemistry]] before the [[Manhattan Project]]. He disputed Smalley's arguments that the fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research, arguing that the potential for long-term risks made research even more important. His conclusion stated, "your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long-term security concerns."

The July 2003 letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=Toward closure|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter2.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=2 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced a note from Smalley promising to respond, which had yet gone unfulfilled. Drexler mentions inconsistencies in Smalley's previous public statements on atom-by-atom construction, and ended by stating "I would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently, but the question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps the most fundamental issue in the field today—it shapes basic objectives and expectations—and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived."

===Exchange of letters in ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''===
[[File:Nanob.jpg|thumb|A depiction of a putative [[technomimetic]] molecular [[planetary gear]] set. Smalley questioned whether devices like these could be constructed using an [[enzyme]]-like mechanical process, either in an [[aqueous solution]] or with some other chemistry, and whether such devices would be operational at all.]]

The debate was concluded in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature that was the 1 December 2003 cover story of ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'', the newsmagazine of the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature first reproduced Drexler's April 2003 open letter to Smalley. Smalley's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused, and stating that Drexler's book ''Engines of Creation'' had triggered Smalley's own interest in nanotechnology. He agreed that "Smalley fingers" could not work, and then asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks, since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled

He then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry, but asked how the nanorobot would be able to obtain, control, and repair such an enzyme, and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water-based biological systems, stating that "biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build, but it can't make a crystal of silicon, or steel, or copper, or aluminum, or titanium, or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built." Smalley asked what kind of "nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry" Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this "a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries."

Drexler's counterresponse began by returning to Feynman's 1959 talk, stating that "although inspired by biology... Feynman's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical, not biological." He characterized the challenges as being that of [[systems engineering]] rather than solely chemistry, and referred Smalley to ''Nanosystems'', with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion. He stated:

{{Quote|Positional control naturally avoids most side reactions by preventing unwanted encounters between potential reactants. Transition-state theory indicates that, for suitably chosen reactants, positional control will enable synthetic steps at megahertz frequencies with the reliability of digital switching operations in a computer. The supporting analysis for this conclusion appears in "Nanosystems" and has withstood a decade of scientific scrutiny.}}

Drexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers, and would augment solution-phase chemistry to produce [[macroscopic]] products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks, using solution-phase molecular assemblers to [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] the construction of more sophisticated assemblers. He concluded by writing:

{{Quote|U.S. progress in molecular manufacturing has been impeded by the dangerous illusion that it is infeasible. I hope you will agree that the actual physical principles of molecular manufacturing are sound and quite unlike the various notions, many widespread in the press, that you have correctly rejected. I invite you to join me and others in the call to augment today's nanoscale research with a systems engineering effort aimed at achieving the grand vision articulated by Richard Feynman.}}

Smalley began his concluding letter:

{{Quote|I see you have now walked out of the room where I had led you to talk about real chemistry, and you are now back in your mechanical world. I am sorry we have ended up like this. For a moment I thought we were making progress. You still do not appear to understand the impact of my short piece in Scientific American. Much like you can't make a boy and a girl fall in love with each other simply by pushing them together, you cannot make precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with simple mechanical motion along a few degrees of freedom in the assembler-fixed frame of reference. Chemistry, like love, is more subtle than that.}}

Smalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach. He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme-like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium, and as all known enzymes use water as that medium, the range of products must be limited to the "meat and bone of biology."  He accused Drexler of creating "a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there."

Lastly, Smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit, saying that nearly half of them thought that self-replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about the results of them spreading across the world. Smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay. Smalley concluded his letter:

{{Quote|You and people around you have scared our children. I don't expect you to stop, but I hope others in the chemical community will join with me in turning on the light, and showing our children that, while our future in the real world will be challenging and there are real risks, there will be no such monster as the self-replicating mechanical nanobot of your dreams.}}

==Critical response==
{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|image1=Raymond Kurzweil Fantastic Voyage.jpg|width1=160|image2=Lessig portrait.jpg|width2=150|footer=The Drexler–Smalley debate attracted commentary from figures such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] (left) and [[Lawrence Lessig]] (right).|alt1=Ray Kurzweil in 2005|alt2=Lawrence Lessig in 2009}}

===Tone===
The debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone. David Berube in ''Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz'' characterized it as "two people talking over each other... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal," and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying "the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and a place in the pantheon."&lt;ref name="berube"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1822/ |pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zyvex]] founder James von Ehr remarked that "Eric [Drexler] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a [[Pissing contest|pissing match]] with a Nobel-prize winner."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;  An article in ''The New York Times'' called the debate "reminiscent of that old ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch... [with] Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue," referring to a version of the long-running [[Weekend Update#Jane Curtin (1976–1980)|Weekend Update]] segment.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

===Technical commentary===
The debate has received technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in ''The Nanotech Pioneers'' noted that the ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of the argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that "nowhere in it does ''Nanosystems'' contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together."  He concludes that "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' declared Drexler as the winner of the debate,&lt;ref name="kurzweil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-303788-9|pages=236&amp;ndash;241}}&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating the view that Smalley distorted Drexler's ideas and calling Smalley's responses "short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors" and asserting that "Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions... [which have] been extensively studied."  He quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions, and pointed out that modern non-biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded the capabilities of natural biological systems. He also noted that "earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible... [but today] we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-drexler-smalley-debate-on-molecular-assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on public perception of nanotechnology===
The debate's focus on the public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger [[Glenn Reynolds]] stated that "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"&gt;Berube, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lawrence Lessig]] criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=Stamping Out Good Science|date=July 2004|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=5|accessdate=12 July 2011|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="kurzweil"/&gt;

[[Image:LV switchboard.jpg|thumb|A modern electric switchboard]]
[[File:Antique-Electrical-Switchboard.jpg|thumb|Antique electrical switchboard, operational at a US plant in 2014. It features open style breakers, mounted on slabs of slate stone insulator.]]

An '''electric switchboard''' is a device that directs [[electricity]] from one or more sources of supply to several smaller regions of usage. It is an assembly of one or more panels, each of which contains [[switch]]es that allow electricity to be redirected. 

==Definition==
The U.S. [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) defines a switchboard as "a large single panel, frame, or assembly of panels on which are mounted, on the face, back, or both, switches, over-current and other protective devices, [[busbar|buses]], and usually instruments". The role of a switchboard is to allow the division of the current supplied to the switchboard into smaller currents for further distribution and to provide switching, current protection and (possibly) metering for those various currents. In general, switchboards may distribute power to transformers, panelboards, control equipment, and, ultimately, to individual system loads.

==Components==
Inside a switchboard there will be one or more [[busbar]]s. These are flat strips of copper or aluminum, to which the switchgear is connected. Busbars carry large [[current (electricity)|current]]s through the switchboard, and are supported by insulators. Bare busbars are common, but many types are now manufactured with an insulating cover on the bars, leaving only connection points exposed.

The operator is protected from [[electric shock|electrocution]] by safety switches and [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]]. There may also be controls for the supply of electricity to the switchboard, coming from a generator or bank of [[electrical generator]]s, especially [[frequency]] control of [[AC power]] and load sharing controls, plus gauges showing frequency and perhaps a [[synchroscope]]. The amount of power going into a switchboard must always equal to the power going out to the loads.

==Enclosure==
Modern industrial switchboards are metal enclosed and of "dead front" construction; no energized parts are accessible when the covers and panels are closed.  Previously, open switchboards were made with switches and other devices were mounted on panels made of slate, granite, or ebony asbestos board. The metal enclosure of the switchboard is bonded to earth ground for protection of personnel.  Large switchboards may be free-standing floor-mounted enclosures with provision for incoming connections at either the top or bottom of the enclosure. A switchboard may have incoming bus bars or bus duct for the source connection, and also for large circuits fed from the board.  A switchboard  may include a metering or control compartment separated from the power distribution conductors.

[[File:Power plant.jpg|thumb|Some electrical engineers design complex power systems on a macroscopic level.]]
[[File:Silego clock generator.JPG|thumb| Electrical engineers also design microscopic electronic devices and electronic circuitry, which achieved the record setting length of 1 [[nanometer]] for a single [[logic gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/10/06/smallest-transistor-1-nm-gate/|title=Smallest.

'''Electrical engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that generally deals with the study and application of [[electricity]], [[electronics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after [[commercialization]] of the electric [[telegraph]], the [[telephone]], and [[electric power]] distribution and use. Subsequently, [[broadcasting]] and [[recording media]] made electronics part of daily life.  The invention of the [[transistor]], and later the [[integrated circuit]], brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.

Electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including [[electronics]], [[digital computers]], [[computer engineering]], [[power engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[control system]]s, [[radio-frequency engineering]], [[signal processing]], [[instrumentation]], and [[microelectronics]]. Many of these subdisciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations such as hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics &amp; waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, electrical materials science, and much more. See [[glossary of electrical and electronics engineering]].

Electrical engineers typically hold a [[academic degree|degree]] in electrical engineering or electronic engineering.  Practicing engineers may have [[professional certification]] and be members of a [[professional body]]. Such bodies include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) ''(formerly the IEE)''.

Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from basic circuit theory to the management skills required of a [[project manager]].  The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple [[voltmeter]] to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.

==History==
{{Main article|History of electrical engineering}}

[[Electricity]] has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early [[17th century]].  [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between [[magnetism]] and [[static electricity]]. He is credited with establishing the term "electricity".{{sfn|Martinsen|Grimnes|2011|p=411}} He also designed the [[versorium]]: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] invented a device later named [[electrophorus]] that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] had developed the [[voltaic pile]], a forerunner of the electric battery

===19th century===
[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology]]
In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of [[Georg Ohm]], who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [[electric current]] and [[potential difference]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], of [[Michael Faraday]] (the discoverer of [[electromagnetic induction]] in 1831), and of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who in 1873 published a unified [[Maxwell's equations|theory]] of electricity and [[magnetism]] in his treatise ''Electricity and Magnetism''.{{sfn|Lambourne|2010|p=11}}

Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.  Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline.  Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Electric Telegraph|url=|journal=Int.

Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardised [[units of measure]]. They led to the international standardization of the units [[volt]], [[ampere]], [[coulomb]], [[ohm]], [[farad]], and [[henry (unit)|henry]]. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.{{Sfn|Rosenberg|2008|p=9}} The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.{{sfn|Tunbridge|1992}}

During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [[physics]] since the early electrical technology was considered [[electromechanical]] in nature. The [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882. The first electrical engineering degree program was started at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, {{Sfn|Wildes|Lindgren|1985|p=19}} though it was [[Cornell University]] to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/about/history.cfm|title=History - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Cornell Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell’s [[Cornell University College of Engineering|Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/about/upload/Cornell-Engineering-history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until about 1885 that [[Cornell University|Cornell]] President [[Andrew Dickson White]] established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.cornell.edu/andrew-dickson-white/|title=Andrew Dickson White - Office of the President|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[University College London]] founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Electrical Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLLmAAAAMAAJ|year=1911|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at [[University of Missouri]] soon followed suit by establishing the electrical engineering department in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.missouri.edu/ece/about/department-history/|title=Department History - Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, [[universities]] and [[institutes of technology]] gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, [[Thomas Edison]] switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts — [[direct current]] (DC) — to 59 customers on [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]]. In 1884, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] invented the [[steam turbine]] allowing for more efficient electric power generation. [[Alternating current]], with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of [[transformer]]s,  developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (later called ZBD transformers), [[Lucien Gaulard]], [[John Dixon Gibbs]] and [[William Stanley, Jr.]]. Practical [[AC motor]] designs including [[induction motor]]s were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] and further developed into a practical [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].{{Sfn|Heertje|Perlman|1990|p=138}} [[Charles Steinmetz]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1229&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&amp;f=false|title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|first=I.|last=Grattan-Guinness|date=1 January 2003|publisher=JHU Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780801873973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lew5IC5piCwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz&amp;f=false|title=Mathematics in Historical Context|first=Jeff|last=Suzuki|date=27 August 2009|publisher=MAA|via=Google Books|isbn=9780883855706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the ''[[War of Currents]]'' between a [[George Westinghouse]] backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.{{sfn|Severs|Leise|2011|p=145}}

===More modern developments===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] known for his pioneering work on long distance radio transmission]]
During the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], many scientists and [[inventor]]s contributed to [[radio communications|radio technology]] and electronics. The mathematical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] including possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called "radio waves"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting [[radio wave]]s with a [[spark-gap transmitter]], and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these "Hertzian waves" into a purpose built commercial [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraphic]] system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of {{convert|2100|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Marconi's biography at Nobelprize.org] retrieved 21 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] introduced the [[cathode ray tube]] as part of an [[oscilloscope]], a crucial enabling technology for [[television|electronic television]].{{sfn|Abramson|1955|p=22}} [[John Ambrose Fleming|John Fleming]] invented the first radio tube, the [[diode]], in 1904. Two years later, [[Robert von Lieben]] and [[Lee De Forest]] independently developed the amplifier tube, called the [[triode]].{{Sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=226}}

In 1920, [[Albert Hull]] developed the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] which would eventually lead to the development of the [[microwave oven]] in 1946 by [[Percy Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Albert W.

The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives, including the [[Apollo program]] which culminated in [[moon landing|landing astronauts on the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The ENIAC Museum Online | url = http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/guys.html | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid-state electronics ===
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A replica of the first working transistor.]]
The invention of the [[transistor]] in late 1947 by [[William Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]], and [[Walter Brattain]] of the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1958 by [[Jack Kilby]] and independently in 1959 by [[Robert Noyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electronics Timeline | work = Greatest Engineering Achievements of the Twentieth Century | url = http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3956 | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began with the "[[Busicom]] Project"&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[[Federico Faggin]], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776530 The Making of the First Microprocessor], ''IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine'', Winter 2009, [[IEEE Xplore]]&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Masatoshi Shima]]'s three-chip [[CPU]] design in 1968,&lt;ref name=tout1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/busicom_141-pf_and_intel_4004.html|title=The Busicom 141-PF calculator and the Intel 4004 microprocessor|author=Nigel Tout|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; before [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]'s [[Tadashi Sasaki (engineer)|Tadashi Sasaki]] conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which he discussed with Busicom and [[Intel]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="sasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url        = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Tadashi_Sasaki |title      = Oral-History: Tadashi Sasaki |last       = Aspray |first      = William |date       = 1994-05-25 |work       = Interview #211 for the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering |publisher  = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. |accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intel 4004 was then developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Federico Faggin]] and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; The microprocessor led to the development of [[microcomputer]]s and [[personal computer]]s, and the [[microcomputer revolution]].

==Subdisciplines==
Electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and [[computer engineering]], are considered separate disciplines in their own right.

===Power===
{{Main article|Power engineering}}
[[File:Power pole.jpg|thumb|right|[[Utility pole|Power pole]]]]
Power engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], and [[electric power distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices.{{Sfn|Grigsby|2012}} These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s, high voltage engineering, and [[power electronics]]. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a [[power grid]] that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Such systems are called ''on-grid'' power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called ''off-grid'' power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.

===Control===
{{Main article|Control engineering|Automatic control|Control theory}}
[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|[[Control systems]] play a critical role in [[spaceflight]].]]
[[Control engineering]] focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic system]]s and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.{{sfn|Bissell|1996|p=17}} To implement such controllers, electrical engineers may use [[electronic circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s, and [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). [[Control engineering]] has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.{{sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=95}} It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[Power (physics)|power]] output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.{{sfn|Fairman|1998|p=119}}

===Electronics===
{{Main article|Electronic engineering}}

[[File:Componentes.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electronic components]]]]
Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of [[electronic circuit]]s that use the properties of [[electrical element|components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Engineering: Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09i67GgGPCYC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2010|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-104156-3|pages=127–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tuned circuit]], which allows the user of a [[radio]] to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.

Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as ''radio engineering'' and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and [[radar]], [[radio|commercial radio]], and [[television|early television]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, [[computer]]s, and [[microprocessors]]. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term ''radio engineering'' gradually gave way to the name ''electronic engineering''.

Before the invention of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1959,{{Sfn|Thompson|2006|p=4}} electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and [[electric power|power]] and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, [[integrated circuit]]s packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly [[transistor]]s,{{Sfn|Merhari|2009|p=233}} into a small chip around the size of a [[coin]]. This allowed for the powerful [[computer]]s and other electronic devices we see today.

===Microelectronics===
{{Main article|Microelectronics}}
[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microprocessor]]]]
[[Microelectronics]] engineering deals with the design and [[microfabrication]] of very small electronic circuit components for use in an [[integrated circuit]] or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component.{{Sfn|Bhushan|1997|p=581}} The most common microelectronic components are [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]]s, although all main electronic components ([[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. [[Nanoelectronics]] is the further scaling of devices down to [[nanometer]] levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100&amp;nbsp;nm processing having been standard since around 2002.{{Sfn|Mook|2008|p=149}}

Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, [[compound semiconductor]]s like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2012}}

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|A [[Bayer filter]] on a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel.]]
[[Signal processing]] deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]].{{Sfn|Tuzlukov|2010|p=20}} Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] of digitally sampled signals.{{Sfn|Manolakis|Ingle|2011|p=17}}

Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of [[digital signal processing]] and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, [[audio engineer]]ing, [[broadcast engineering]], power electronics, and [[biomedical engineering]] as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. [[Analog signal processing]] is still important in the design of many [[control system]]s.

DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital [[television set]]s,{{sfn|Bayoumi|Swartzlander|1994|p=25}} radios, [[Hi-Fi]] audio equipment, mobile phones, [[Portable Media Player|multimedia players]], camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, [[noise cancelling]] headphones, digital [[spectrum analyzer]]s, missile guidance systems, [[radar]] systems, and [[telematics]] systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for [[noise reduction]], [[speech recognition]] or [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]], [[Codec|encoding or decoding]] digital media, wirelessly [[Transceiver|transmitting or receiving]] data, triangulating position using [[GPS]], and other kinds of [[image processing]], [[video processing]], [[audio signal processing|audio processing]], and [[speech processing]].{{Sfn|Khanna|2009|p=297}}

===Telecommunications===
{{Main article|Telecommunications engineering}}
[[File:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satellite dish]]es are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information.]]
[[Telecommunications|Telecommunications engineering]] focuses on the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[communication channel]] such as a [[coax cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space optical communications|free space]].{{sfn|Tobin|2007|p=15}} Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier signal]] to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]].{{Sfn|Chandrasekhar|2006|p=21}} The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Zhang|Hu|Luo|2007|p=448}} If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

===Instrumentation===
{{Main article|Instrumentation engineering}}
[[File:F-18E cockpit m02006112600499.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flight instruments]] provide pilots with the tools to control aircraft analytically.]]
[[Instrumentation engineering]] deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], and [[temperature]].{{Sfn|Grant|Bixley|2011|p=159}} The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[flight instruments]] measure variables such as [[wind speed]] and [[altitude]] to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier-Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.{{sfn|Fredlund|Rahardjo|Fredlund|2012|p=346}}

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on the Use of Thermocouples in Temperature Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pos-MXDWb6MC&amp;pg=PA154|date=1 January 1993|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-1466-1|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.

===Computers===
{{Main article|Computer engineering}}
[[File:MEGWARE.CLIC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supercomputer]]s are used in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]] and [[geographic information systems]].]]
Computer engineering deals with the design of [[computer]]s and [[computer system]]s. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware|hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]], tablets, and [[supercomputers]], or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]].{{sfn|Obaidat|Denko|Woungang|2011|p=9}} Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.{{sfn|Jalote|2006|p=22}} [[Desktop computer]]s represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including [[video game console]]s and [[DVD player]]s.

===Related disciplines===
[[File:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|left|The Bird VIP Infant ventilator]]
[[Mechatronics]] is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and [[machine|mechanical]] systems. Such combined systems are known as [[electromechanical]] systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include [[automation|automated manufacturing systems]],{{sfn|Mahalik|2003|p=569}} [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems]],{{sfn|Leondes|2000|p=199}} and various subsystems of [[aircraft]] and [[automobile]]s.
{{sfn|Shetty|Kolk|2010|p=36}}
''Electronic systems design'' is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pp=1|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mechatronics'' is typically used to refer to [[macroscopic]] systems but [[Futures studies|futurists]] have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell [[airbag]]s when to deploy,{{sfn|Maluf|Williams|2004|p=3}} in [[digital projector]]s to create sharper images, and in [[inkjet printer]]s to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve [[optical communication]].{{Sfn|Iga|Kokubun|2010|p=137}}

[[Biomedical engineering]] is another related discipline, concerned with the design of [[medical equipment]]. This includes fixed equipment such as [[ventilator]]s, [[MRI|MRI scanners]],{{Sfn|Dodds|Kumar|Veering|2014|p=274}} and [[electrocardiograph|electrocardiograph monitors]] as well as mobile equipment such as [[cochlear implant]]s, [[artificial pacemaker]]s, and [[artificial heart]]s.

[[Aerospace engineering]] and [[robotics]] an example is the most recent [[electric propulsion]] and ion propulsion.

==Education==
{{Main article|Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers}}
[[File:Osciloscopio locomotora.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oscilloscope]]]]
Electrical engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical engineering, [[electronics engineering]], [[electrical engineering technology]],&lt;ref name=BLS3&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineer|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-4|work=[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], 2012-13 Edition|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or electrical and electronic engineering.{{Sfn|Chaturvedi|1997|p=253}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is the difference between electrical and electronic engineering? | work = FAQs - Studying Electrical Engineering | url = http://www.ieee.org/portal/site/mainsite/menuitem.818c0c39e85ef176fb2275875bac26c8/index.jsp?&amp;pName=corp_level1&amp;path=education/faqs&amp;file=faqs1.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl | accessdate =20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Technology]], or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] depending on the university. The [[bachelor's degree]] generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[project management]], and a [[list of electrical engineering topics|variety of topics in electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name="Enterprise1986"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computerworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVHbRM6mU9gC&amp;pg=PA97|date=25 August 1986|publisher=IDG Enterprise|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study.

[[File:LM317 typical schematic.svg|thumb|left|An example [[circuit diagram]]. It is used as a powerful tool in [[troubleshooting]]. ]]

At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineering|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/csem/disciplines/eee/|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]]/[[Master of Science]] (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of [[Engineering Management]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an [[Engineering Doctorate]] (Eng.D.), or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than postgraduate.&lt;ref&gt;Various including graduate degree requirements [http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html at MIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116055044/http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html |date=16 January 2006 }}, study guide [http://www.ecm.uwa.edu.au/students/study-guides-2012/be-elec-mech at UWA], the curriculum [http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/appsci/pg219.html at Queen's] and unit tables [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/calendar/requirements/07H50116.doc at Aberdeen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicing engineers==

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]].&lt;ref name="Labor2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4ZS7UQ1QZoC|date=1 March 2008|publisher=U S Department of Labor, Jist Works|isbn=978-1-59357-513-7|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), [[Chartered engineer|Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]]  (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and [[Zimbabwe]]), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]).

[[File:3 Park Avenue.JPG|thumb|left|The [[IEEE]] corporate office is on the 17th floor of [[3 Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]]]]
The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate =11 July 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec]]'s Engineers Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=//I_9/I9_A.htm | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[ethical code|code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Codes of Ethics and Conduct | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, the charge of [[criminal negligence]]. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET).  The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IEEE | work = IEEE | url = http://www.ieee.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IET | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal and Magazines | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/publishing/journals/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessdate =16 July 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm|archivedate=13 July 2005}} (see [[work of the United States Government|here]] regarding copyright)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Canada, and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force (see [[#demographics|&lt;span id="demographics_back"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;]]).

==Tools and work==

From the [[Global Positioning System]] to [[electricity generation|electric power generation]], electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of [[telecommunication|telecommunication systems]], the operation of [[power station|electric power stations]], the [[lighting]] and [[electrical wiring|wiring]] of [[building]]s, the design of [[home appliance|household appliances]], or the electrical [[control theory|control]] of industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |accessdate=16 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |archivedate=13 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (see )&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molnya-1 Musee du Bourget P1010442.jpg|thumb|left|[[Communications satellite|Satellite communications]] is typical of what electrical engineers work on.]]
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] as these help to obtain both a [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[Quantity|quantitative]] description of how such systems will work. Today most [[engineering]] work involves the use of [[computers]] and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.

[[File:Shadow Hand Bulb large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Shadow Hand|Shadow robot hand]] system]]
Although most electrical engineers will understand basic [[circuit theory]] (that is the interactions of elements such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, and [[inductor]]s in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even [[circuit theory]] may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use [[commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize [[numeracy|strong numerical skills]], [[computer literacy]], and the ability to understand the [[technical terminology|technical language and concepts]] that relate to electrical engineering.{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=241}}

[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A [[laser]] bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]

A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers.  For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic [[multimeter]] measuring [[voltage]], [[electric current|current]], and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] may suffice.  Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the [[oscilloscope]] is also an ubiquitous instrument.  In [[RF engineering]] and high frequency telecommunications, [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]]s are used.  In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation.  For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids.{{sfn|Leitgeb|2010|p=122}} Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although [[voltmeter]]s may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naidu|Kamaraju|2009|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.  Audio electronics engineers use [[audio system measurements|audio test sets]] consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as [[harmonic distortion]] and [[noise (electronics)|noise]].  Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.

[[File:Navy-Radome.jpg|left|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Radome]] at the Misawa Air Base Misawa Security Operations Center, Misawa, Japan]]
For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing [[budget]]s and determining [[schedule (project management)|project schedules]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, James; (2005). ''What Do Engineers Really Do?''. University of Western Australia. (seminar with [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/Engineering%20Roles%20050503.pdf slides])&lt;/ref&gt; Many senior engineers manage a team of [[technician]]s or other engineers and for this reason [[project management]] skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and [[technical writing|strong written communication]] skills are therefore very important.

The [[Office|workplaces]] of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a [[fabrication plant]], onboard a [[Naval ship]], the offices of a [[consulting firm]] or on site at a [[mining|mine]]. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including [[scientist]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[computer programmers]], and other engineers.{{Sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=87}}

Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences.  For instance, the physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] played a major role in the engineering of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]] produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects.  For instance, large [[particle accelerator]]s such as [[CERN]] need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project: from the power distribution, to the instrumentation, to the manufacture and installation of the [[superconducting electromagnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martini, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic road pricing''' is the technology and mechanism to toll drivers [[electronic toll collection|by electronic means]] in an area within which [[road pricing]] is imposed. It was first put into trial in Hong Kong in the early 1980s, but its implementation was aborted. Current systems include Singapore, [[Singapore]]; London, England, United Kingdom; and Stockholm, Sweden.

'''Emerging technologies''' are technologies that are perceived as capable of changing the status quo. These technologies are generally new but include older technologies that are still controversial and relatively undeveloped in potential, such as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] and [[gene therapy]] which date to 1989 and 1990 respectively.

Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty, relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity. In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous.".&lt;ref&gt;Rotolo, D., Hicks, D., Martin, B. R. (2015) What is an emerging technology? Research Policy 44(10): 1827–1843. Available [https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2564094 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as [[educational technology]], [[information technology]], [[nanotechnology]], [[biotechnology]], [[cognitive science]], psychotechnology, [[robotics]], and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;other examples of developments described as "emerging technologies" can be found [http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/18/keynotes.html here] – O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference 2008 .&lt;/ref&gt;

New technological fields may result from the [[technological convergence]] of different systems evolving towards similar goals. Convergence brings previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video together so that they share resources and interact with each other, creating new efficiencies.

Emerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for [[economic competition|competitive advantage]];&lt;ref&gt;International Congress Innovation and Technology XXI: Strategies and Policies Towards the XXI Century, &amp; Soares, O. D. D. (1997). Innovation and technology: Strategies and policies. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals. However, the opinion on the degree of the impact, status and economic viability of several emerging and converging technologies.

In the [[history of technology]], emerging technologies&lt;ref&gt;Emerging Technologies: From Hindsight to Foresight. Edited by Edna F. Einsiedel. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerging technologies: where is the federal government on the high tech curve? : hearing before the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology of the Committee on Government Reform, House of Representatives, One Hundred Sixth Congress, second session, April 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; are contemporary advances and innovation in various fields of [[technology]].

Over centuries innovative methods and new technologies are developed and opened up. Some of these technologies are due to theoretical research, and others from commercial [[research and development]].

Technological growth includes incremental developments and [[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]]. An example of the former was the gradual roll-out of [[DVD]] (digital video disc) as a development intended to follow on from the previous optical technology [[compact disc]]. By contrast, disruptive technologies are those where a new method replaces the previous technology and makes it redundant, for example, the replacement of horse-drawn carriages by automobiles and other vehicles.

== Emerging technology debates  ==
{{see also|Technology and society}}
Many writers, including [[computer scientist]] [[Bill Joy]],&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]",&lt;/ref&gt; have identified clusters of  technologies that they consider critical to humanity's future. Joy warns that the technology could be used by elites for [[Good and evil|good]] or [[evil]]. They could use it as "good shepherds" for the rest of humanity, or decide everyone else is superfluous and push for mass extinction of those made unnecessary by technology.&lt;ref name="Joy 2000"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Joy, Bill| author-link = Bill Joy | title = Why the future doesn't need us | date = 2000 | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html| accessdate=2005-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the benefits of [[technological change]] typically see emerging and converging technologies as offering hope for the betterment of the [[human condition]]. Cyberphilosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] argue in ''The Futurica Trilogy'' that while Man himself is basically constant throughout human history ([[Genetics|genes]] change very slowly), all relevant change is rather a direct or indirect result of technological innovation ([[Memetics|memes]] change very fast) since new ideas always emanate from technology use and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=9187173247|title=The Futurica Trilogy|first1=Alexander|last1=Bard|first2=Jan|last2=Söderqvist|date=8 May 2012|publisher=Stockholm Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man should consequently be regarded as history's main constant and technology as its main variable. However, critics of the risks of technological change, and even some advocates such as [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]], warn that some of these technologies could pose dangers, perhaps even contribute to the [[human extinction|extinction of humanity]] itself; i.e., some of them could involve [[existential risk]]s.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Bostrom, Nick| author-link = Nick Bostrom| title = Existential risks: analyzing human extinction scenarios| date = 2002 | url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html| accessdate=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Warwick|Warwick, K]]: “March of the Machines”, University of Illinois Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Much [[ethics of technology|ethical debate]] centers on issues of [[distributive justice]] in allocating access to beneficial forms of technology. Some thinkers, such as [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]], oppose the continuing development of advanced technology partly out of fear that its benefits will be distributed unequally in ways that could worsen the [[economic inequality|plight of the poor]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=McKibben, Bill|author-link=Bill McKibben|title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age|publisher=Times Books|date=2003|isbn=0-8050-7096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[inventor]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] is among [[techno-utopianism|techno-utopians]] who believe that emerging and converging technologies could and will [[post scarcity|eliminate poverty]] and abolish suffering.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = Kurzweil, Raymond| author-link = Raymond Kurzweil| title = [[The Singularity Is Near|The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology]] | publisher = Viking Adult| date = 2005 | isbn = 0-670-03384-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts such as Martin Ford, author of ''The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future'',&lt;ref name="Ford2009Lights"&gt;{{Ford 2009 The lights in the tunnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that as information technology advances, robots and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant [[unemployment]] as machines and software begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine jobs.

As robotics and artificial intelligence develop further, even many skilled jobs may be threatened. Technologies such as machine learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://econfuture.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/machine-learning-a-job-killer/|title=Machine Learning: A job killer?|first=|last=econfuture|date=14 April 2011|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; may ultimately allow computers to do many knowledge-based jobs that require significant education. This may result in substantial unemployment at all skill levels, stagnant or falling wages for most workers, and increased concentration of income and wealth as the owners of capital capture an ever-larger fraction of the economy. This in turn could lead to depressed consumer spending and economic growth as the bulk of the population lacks sufficient discretionary income to purchase the products and services produced by the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://singularityhub.com/2009/12/15/martin-ford-asks-will-automation-lead-to-economic-collapse/|title=Martin Ford Asks: Will Automation Lead to Economic Collapse?|first=Aaron|last=Saenz|date=15 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

== Examples ==
{{Main|List of emerging technologies}}

=== Artificial intelligence ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence|Outline of artificial intelligence}}

''Artificial intelligence'' (''AI'') is the sub intelligence exhibited by machines or software, and the branch of [[computer science]] that develops machines and software with animal-like intelligence. Major AI researchers and textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents", where an [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], who coined the term in 1942, defines it as "the study of making intelligent machines".

The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, [[natural language processing]] (communication), [[perception]] and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (or "[[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]") is still among the field's long-term goals. Currently popular approaches include deep learning, statistical methods, computational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI. There are an enormous number of tools used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics, and many others.

=== 3D Printing ===
{{Main|3D Printing}}
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has been posited by [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and others as part of the [[Digital Revolution|third industrial revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thethirdindustrialrevolution.com/|title=Home – Office of Jeremy Rifkin|website=Office of Jeremy Rifkin|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with Internet technology, 3D printing would allow for digital blueprints of virtually any material product to be sent instantly to another person to be produced on the spot, making purchasing a product online almost instantaneous.

Although this technology is still too crude to produce most products, it is rapidly developing and created a controversy in 2013 around the issue of 3D printed guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/3d-printed-guns-are-only-getting-better-and-scarier-1677747439|title=3D-Printed Guns Are Only Getting Better, and Scarier|first=Adam Clark|last=Estes|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene therapy ===

{{Main|Gene therapy}}
{{See also|Genetic engineering timeline}}

Gene therapy was first successfully demonstrated in late 1990/early 1991 for [[adenosine deaminase deficiency]], though the treatment was somatic – that is, did not affect the patient's germ line and thus was not heritable. This led the way to treatments for other genetic diseases and increased interest in [[germ line gene therapy]] – therapy affecting the gametes and descendants of patients.

Between September 1990 and January 2014 there were around 2,000 gene therapy trials conducted or approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical/|title=Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Worldwide|website=www.wiley.com|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer vaccines ===
{{Main|Cancer vaccine}}

A ''cancer vaccine'' is a [[vaccine]] that treats existing [[cancer]] or prevents the development of cancer in certain high-risk individuals. Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as ''therapeutic'' cancer vaccines. There are currently no vaccines able to prevent cancer in general.

On April 14, 2009, [[Dendreon]] Corporation announced that their Phase III clinical trial of [[Provenge]], a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer, had demonstrated an increase in survival. It received [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)  approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ApprovedProducts/ucm210215.htm |date=2010-04-29 |title=Approval Letter – Provenge |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approval of Provenge has stimulated interest in this type of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/what-comes-after-dendreon-s-provenge/77899342/ |title=What Comes After Dendreon’s Provenge? |date=18 Oct 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' meat ===
{{Main|In vitro meat}}

''In vitro meat'', also called ''cultured meat'', ''clean meat'', ''cruelty-free meat'', ''shmeat'', and ''test-tube meat'', is an animal-flesh product that has never been part of a living animal with exception of the [[fetal calf serum]] taken from a slaughtered cow.  In the 21st century, several research projects have worked on ''in vitro'' meat in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |last = Siegelbaum |first = D.J. |title = In Search of a Test-Tube Hamburger |publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date = 2008-04-23 |url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1734630,00.html?imw=Y |accessdate = 2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cultured meat#First public trial|first in vitro beefburger]], created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC5Aug&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23576143|title=World's first lab-grown burger is eaten in London|date=5 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There remain difficulties to be overcome before ''in vitro'' meat becomes commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/science/engineering-the-325000-in-vitro-burger.html|title=Engineering the $325,000 In Vitro Burger|first=Henry|last=Fountain|date=12 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves.&lt;ref name="no-kill carnivore"&gt;{{cite news |last= Temple |first= James |title = The Future of Food: The No-kill Carnivore |publisher = [[Portfolio.com]] |date = 2009-02-23 |url = http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/dual-perspectives/2009/02/23/The-No-kill-Carnivore|accessdate = 2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharma Concepts"&gt;[http://www.new-harvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/culturedmeatecon.pdf Preliminary Economics Study of Cultured Meat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003000000/http://www.new-harvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/culturedmeatecon.pdf |date=October 3, 2015 }}, eXmoor Pharma Concepts, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''In vitro'' meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesn't involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Nanotechnology ===
{{Main|Nanotechnology|Outline of nanotechnology}}

''Nanotechnology'' (sometimes shortened to ''nanotech'') is the manipulation of matter on an [[atom]]ic, [[molecular]], and [[Supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular]] scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology&lt;ref name=Engines1&gt;{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology|date=1986|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0-385-19973-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nanotsystems&gt;{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation|date=1992|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-57547-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as [[molecular nanotechnology]]. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 [[nanometers]]. This definition reflects the fact that [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects are important at this [[quantum realm|quantum-realm]] scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold.

=== Robotics ===
{{Main|Robotics|Outline of robotics}}

''Robotics'' is the branch of [[technology]] that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of [[robot]]s,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|title=robotics|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0714530#m_en_gb0714530|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition. A good example of robots which resembles humans is [[Sophia (robot)|Sophia]], a social [[humanoid robot]] developed by [[Hong Kong]]-based company [[Hanson Robotics Limited|Hanson Robotics]] which was activated on April 19, 2015. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of [[bio-inspired robotics]].

=== Stem cell therapy ===
{{Main|Stem cell therapy}}

''Stem cell therapy'' is an intervention strategy that introduces new adult stem cells into damaged tissue in order to treat disease or injury. Many [[medical research]]ers believe that stem cell treatments have the potential to change the face of human disease and alleviate suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindvall |first1=O. |last2=Kokaia |first2=Z. |date=2006 |title=Stem cells for the treatment of neurological disorders |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue= 7097| doi = 10.1038/nature04960 | pmid=16810245 |pages=1094–1096 |bibcode=2006Natur.441.1094L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of [[stem cell]]s to self-renew and give rise to subsequent generations with variable degrees of differentiation capacities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81692-X |author=Weissman IL |title=Stem cells: units of development, units of regeneration, and units in evolution |journal=Cell |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=157–68 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10647940 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(00)81692-X}} as cited in {{cite journal |author=Gurtner GC|author2=Callaghan MJ|author3=Longaker MT |title=Progress and potential for regenerative medicine |journal=Annu.

=== Distributed ledger technology===
{{Main|Blockchain|Smart contracts}}''Distributed ledger'' or ''blockchain technology'' is a technology which provides transparent and immutable lists of transactions. Blockchains can enable autonomous transactions through the use of [[smart contract]]s. Smart contracts are self-executing transactions which occur when pre-defined conditions are met. The original idea of a smart contract was conceived by [[Nick Szabo]] in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html|title=Nick Szabo -- Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets|website=www.fon.hum.uva.nl|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these original theories about how these smart contracts could work remained unrealised because there was no technology to support programmable agreements and transactions between parties. His example of a smart contract was the vending machine that holds goods until money has been received and then the goods are released to the buyer. The machine holds the property and is able to enforce the contract. There were two main issues that needed to be addressed before smart contracts could be used in the real world. Firstly, the control of physical assets by smart contracts to be able to enforce agreements. Secondly, the last of trustworthy computers that are reliable and trusted to execute the contract between two or more parties. It is only with the advent of [[cryptocurrency]] and [[encryption]] that the technology for smart contracts has come to fruition. Many potential applications of smart contracts have been suggested that go beyond the transfer of value from one party to another, such as supply chain management, electronic voting, law and the internet of things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/581948/EPRS_IDA(2017)581948_EN.pdf How blockchain technology could change our lives] - European Parliamentary Research Service&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Innovation Through Blockchain: The B3 Perspective|last=Vincenzo|first=Morabito|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=101–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of emerging technologies ==
As innovation drives economic growth, and large economic rewards come from new inventions, a great deal of resources (funding and effort) go into the development of emerging technologies.  Some of the sources of these resources are described below...

=== Research and development ===
[[Research and development]] is directed towards the advancement of technology in general, and therefore includes development of emerging technologies.  ''See also [[List of countries by research and development spending]].''

[[Applied research]] is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of science. It accesses and uses some part of the research communities' (the academia's) accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, often state-, business-, or client-driven purpose.

[[Science policy]] is the area of public policy which is concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the science and research enterprise, including the funding of science, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.

=== DARPA ===
The [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] is an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.

DARPA was created in 1958 as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Its purpose was to formulate and execute research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, with the aim to reach beyond immediate military requirements.

Projects funded by DARPA have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as the [[ARPANET|Internet]] and Global Positioning System technology.

=== Technology competitions and awards ===
There are awards that provide incentive to push the limits of technology (generally synonymous with emerging technologies).  Note that while some of these awards reward achievement after-the-fact via analysis of the merits of technological breakthroughs, others provide incentive via competitions for awards offered for goals yet to be achieved.

The [[Orteig Prize]] was a $25,000 award offered in 1919 by French hotelier [[Raymond Orteig]] for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris.  In 1927, underdog [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the [[Spirit of St. Louis]].  In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.

The XPRIZE series of awards, public competitions designed and managed by the non-profit organization called the [[X Prize Foundation]], are intended to encourage technological development that could benefit mankind. The most high-profile XPRIZE to date was the $10,000,000 Ansari XPRIZE relating to spacecraft development, which was awarded in 2004 for the development of [[SpaceShipOne]].

The [[Turing Award]] is an annual prize given by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) to "an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community". It is stipulated that "The contributions should be of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field". The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, and in 2014 grew to $1,000,000.

The [[Millennium Technology Prize]] is awarded once every two years by [[Technology Academy Finland]], an independent fund established by Finnish industry and the Finnish state in partnership.  The first recipient was [[Tim Berners-Lee]], inventor of the [[World Wide Web]].

In 2003, [[David Gobel]] seed-funded the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] (Mprize) to encourage the development of new life extension therapies in mice, which are genetically similar to humans. So far, three Mouse Prizes have been awarded: one for breaking longevity records to Dr. Andrzej Bartke of [[Southern Illinois University]]; one for late-onset rejuvenation strategies to Dr. Stephen Spindler of the [[University of California]]; and one to Dr. Z. Dave Sharp for his work with the pharmaceutical rapamycin.

== Role of science fiction ==

[[Science fiction]] has criticized developing and future technologies, but also inspires [[innovation]] and new technology. This topic has been more often discussed in literary and sociological than in scientific forums. Cinema and media theorist [[Vivian Sobchack]] examines the dialogue between science fiction films and technological imagination. Technology impacts artists and how they portray their fictionalized subjects, but the fictional world gives back to science by broadening imagination. ''[[How William Shatner Changed the World]]'' is a documentary that gave a number of real-world examples of actualized technological imaginations. While more prevalent in the early years of science fiction with writers like [[Arthur C. Clarke]], new authors still find ways to make currently impossible technologies seem closer to being realized.

==History==
In 2008 the [[Gates Foundation]] awarded $100,000 to Hiroyuki Matsuoka of [[Jichi Medical University]] in [[Japan]] to do research on them, with a condition that any discoveries that were funded by the grant must be made available at affordable prices in the [[developing world]]. If Matsuoka proves that his idea has merit, he will be eligible for an additional $1 million of funding. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' referred to flying syringes as a "bold idea".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102203083.html Flying Syringes and Other Bold Ideas], ''The Washington Post'', October 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''General Maxwell R. Thurman Award''' is awarded on behalf of the commanding general of the [[United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]] at the [[American Telemedicine Association]] (ATA) annual conference in recognition of someone who exhibits and demonstrates the following qualities and attributes: a natural born leader, an innovator, someone who fosters positive change, a champion of the soldier, and a pioneer of the advancement of technology to enhance the life of our service members.  The award is named after four star General [[Maxwell R. Thurman]], who was a champion of the soldier and a pioneer of advancing technology.  His famous motto, which is engraved on the award is as follows:  "The mission of the Army Medical Department is to provide world class combat casualty care to America's most precious resource - It's Sons  and Daughters - In Peace and War!"&lt;ref name=ThurmanQuote/&gt;  This award was originally given out at the very first DoD "Global Forum"  by its creator, BG [[Russ Zajtchuk]] in 1995 and is now an annual tradition at every ATA meeting.

{{term|term= '''[[Chemical bond]]'''}}{{defn|defn=Is a lasting attraction between [[atom]]s, [[ions]] or [[molecules]] that enables the formation of [[chemical compound]]s.

'''HARASSmap''' is a mobile and online technology non-profit that uses interactive mapping to try to reduce the social acceptability of sexual harassment throughout Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who we are|url=http://harassmap.org/en/who-we-are/|work=HARASSmap|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{further|Mass sexual assault in Egypt}}
As of 2005, HARASSmap co-founder Rebecca Chiao began investigating the prevalence of sexual harassment in the daily life of Egyptian women and eventually, with the help of friends and volunteers, launched a campaign that would eventually be adopted by the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who we are and why we began|url=http://harassmap.org/en/who-we-are/how-and-why-we-began/|work=HARASSmap|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these efforts were aimed towards changing sexual harassment legislation within the Egyptian government to better criminalize offences, there was a push for more urgent action. In a 2008 study conducted by the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights, researchers found that out of the 1,010 women they surveyed, 83% of Egyptian women and 98% of foreign women in Egypt said they had experienced sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Clouds in Egypt's Sky" Sexual Harassment: from Verbal Harassment to Rape A Sociological Study|url=http://egypt.unfpa.org/english/publication/6eeeb05a-3040-42d2-9e1c-2bd2e1ac8cac|work=Egyptian Center for Women's Rights|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding it was time for some on-the-ground action, Chiao and HARASSmap co-founder [[Engy Ghozlan]] decided to harness the power of a mobile friendly population and linked [[FrontlineSMS]] and [[Ushahidi]] to create the technological basis for HARASSmap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How and why we began|url=http://harassmap.org/en/who-we-are/how-and-why-we-began/|work=HARASSmap|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansari|first=Hina P.|title=Could Mobile Technology Combat Sexual Harassment?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/hina-p-ansari/harassmap-egypt_b_2654388.html?view=screen|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founders ===

HARASSmap was co-founded in 2010 by Rebecca Chiao (Project Leader), Engy Ghozlan, Amel Fahmy (Principal investigator of Research Unit) and Sawsan Gad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our core team|url=http://harassmap.org/en/who-we-are/our-core-team/|work=HARASSmap|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

As a volunteer-based initiative, HARASSmap aims to end the social acceptability of sexual harassment and assault in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who we are|url=http://harassmap.org/en/who-we-are/|work=HARASSmap|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its interactive mapping service and community outreach service, HARASSmap offers self-defence classes and community education for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuce|first=Serpil T.|author2=Nitin Agarwal |author3=Rolf T.

== How it works ==

When someone experiences or is a witness to an incidence of sexual harassment, they can fill out an online report or send the report via SMS, e-mail, Twitter or Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report Harassment|url=http://harassmap.org/en/take-action/report-harassment/|work=HARASSmap|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the details of the incident as well as address, street name and public points of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansari|first=Hina P.|title=Could Mobile Technology Combat Sexual Harassment?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/hina-p-ansari/harassmap-egypt_b_2654388.html?view=screen|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; HARASSmap then verifies the reports and places them on a Google map of Egypt, which localises sexual harassment hotspots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee, Kermeliotis|first=Ian, Teo|title='Harassment map' helps Egyptian women stand up for their rights|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/21/world/africa/harassmap-egypt-mobile-phones|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map will show red dots where incidences of sexual harassment have taken place.

HARASSmap volunteers visit the areas where incidences have occurred to raise awareness about what constitutes sexual harassment and to work towards ending it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee, Kermeliotis|first=Ian, Teo|title='Harassment map' helps Egyptian women stand up for their rights|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/21/world/africa/harassmap-egypt-mobile-phones|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansari|first=Hina P.|title=Could Mobile Technology Combat Sexual Harassment?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/hina-p-ansari/harassmap-egypt_b_2654388.html?view=screen|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By meeting with local shop owners, police officers, doormen and other public venues, the HARASSmap team is working to mobilize them to make their neighbourhoods "harassment-free zones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community action|url=http://harassmap.org/en/what-we-do/community-action/|work=HARASSmap|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and grants ==

HARASSmap won the 2011 World Summit Youth Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HARASSmap: Youth Award Winner|url=http://www.youthaward.org/winners/harassmap|work=World Summit Youth Award|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2012 Deutsche Welle Best of the Blogs Award for 'Best Use of Technology for Social Good'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Use of Technology for Social Good|url=https://thebobs.com/english/category/history/?year=history-2012&amp;content=winner|work=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now an incubated social enterprise at Nahdey El Mahrousa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incubated social enterprises|url=http://nahdetelmahrousa.org/social-enterprises/harassmap|work=Nahdet el Mahrousa|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since HARASSmap's inception, they have been approached by activists from 25 countries for help adopting similar initiatives. In 2012, the [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC) of Canada offered HARASSmap a grant to continue study sexual harassment in Egypt based on reports submitted by participants and gather information on the methodological issues in the collection and use of crowd sourced data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HarassMap: Using Crowdsourced Data in the Social Sciences|url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Misc/Pages/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectNumber=106623|work=IDRC|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anti-nuclear movement sidebar}}

The application of [[nuclear technology]], both as a source of energy and as an instrument of war, has been controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-nuclear-energy-pro-and-con.html?_r=1 |title=Sunday Dialogue: Nuclear Energy, Pro and Con |author= |date=February 25, 2012  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=contr&gt;Robert Benford.

Scientists and diplomats have debated nuclear weapons policy since before the [[atomic bombing]] of [[Hiroshima]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="brow"/&gt; The public became concerned about [[nuclear weapons testing]] from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. In 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=dagmar2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dagmar-wilson-20110130,0,5499397.story |title=Dagmar Wilson dies at 94; organizer of women's disarmament protesters |author=Woo, Elaine |date=January 30, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hevesi, Dennis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/us/24wilson.html |title=Dagmar Wilson, Anti-Nuclear Leader, Dies at 94 |author=Hevesi, Dennis |date=January 23, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, many countries ratified the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing.&lt;ref name="rudig2"/&gt;

Some local opposition to [[nuclear power]] emerged in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name=well&gt;Paula Garb. [http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm  Review of Critical Masses], ''Journal of Political Ecology'', Vol 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns.&lt;ref name="rudig"/&gt; In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in [[Wyhl]], Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="pub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="got"/&gt; Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=jimfalk&gt;Jim Falk (1982).

In 1945 in the [[New Mexico]] desert, American scientists conducted "[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]," the first [[nuclear weapons test]], marking the beginning of the [[atomic age]].&lt;ref name=pal/&gt; Even before the Trinity test, national leaders debated the impact of nuclear weapons on domestic and foreign policy. Also involved in the debate about nuclear weapons policy was the scientific community, through professional associations such as the [[Federation of Atomic Scientists]] and the [[Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]].&lt;ref name=brow/&gt;

On August 6, 1945, towards the end of [[World War II]], the [[Little Boy]] device was detonated over the [[Japan]]ese military city of [[Hiroshima]]. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500&amp;nbsp;tonnes of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the [[headquarters]] of the [[Second General Army (Japan)|2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]]) and killed approximately 75,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese soldiers and 20,000 Korean slave laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Uranium |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A to Z Guide to the Elements |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=0-19-850340-7 |authorlink=John Emsley |first=John |last=Emsley |pages=478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detonation of the [[Fat Man]] device exploded over the Japanese industrial city of [[Nagasaki]] three days later after Hiroshima, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200-28,200 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers &amp; Artists Against Nuclear Energy &amp; Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22–29 |date=May 1, 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two bombings remains the only events where nuclear weapons have been used in [[combat]]. Subsequently, the world's nuclear weapons stockpiles grew.&lt;ref name=pal&gt;Mary Palevsky, Robert Futrell, and Andrew Kirk.

[[Operation Crossroads]] was a series of [[nuclear weapon]] tests conducted by the [[United States and nuclear weapons|United States]] at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the summer of 1946. Its purpose was to test the effect of nuclear weapons on naval ships. Pressure to cancel Operation Crossroads came from scientists and diplomats. [[Manhattan Project]] scientists argued that further nuclear testing was unnecessary and environmentally dangerous. A Los Alamos study warned "the water near a recent surface explosion will be a witch's brew" of radioactivity. To prepare the atoll for the nuclear tests, Bikini's native residents were evicted from their homes and resettled on smaller, uninhabited islands where they were unable to sustain themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when a Hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific contaminated the crew of the Japanese fishing boat ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=rudig2/&gt; One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later. The incident caused widespread concern around the world and "provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries".&lt;ref name=rudig2&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-nuclear weapons movement grew rapidly because for many people the atomic bomb "encapsulated the very worst direction in which society was moving".&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified "Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs". Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and "an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt;

German publications of the 1950s and 1960s contained criticism of some features of nuclear power including its safety. Nuclear waste disposal was widely recognized as a major problem, with concern publicly expressed as early as 1954. In 1964, one author went so far as to state "that the dangers and costs of the necessary final disposal of nuclear waste could possibly make it necessary to forego the development of nuclear energy".&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was issued in [[London]] on July 9, 1955 by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the midst of the [[Cold War]]. It highlighted the dangers posed by [[nuclear weapons]] and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist [[Cyrus S. Eaton]] offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], held in July 1957.

In the United Kingdom, the first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] organised by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt;

In 1959, a letter in the ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' was the start of a successful campaign to stop the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] dumping [[radioactive waste]] in the sea 19 kilometres from [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]]. It was the largest national women's [[peace march|peace protest]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="dagmar2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hevesi, Dennis"/&gt;

In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to [[nuclear testing|nuclear-weapon testing]]. The "[[Baby Tooth Survey]]," headed by Dr [[Louise Reiss]], demonstrated conclusively in 1961 that above-ground nuclear testing posed significant public health risks in the form of [[nuclear fallout|radioactive fallout]] spread primarily via milk from cows that had ingested contaminated grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/134/3491/1669.pdf | title=Strontium-90 Absorption by Deciduous Teeth: Analysis of teeth provides a practicable method of monitoring strontium-90 uptake by human populations | accessdate=October 13, 2009 | author=Louise Zibold Reiss | date=November 24, 1961 | publisher=Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page26.html | title=Strontium-90 | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Thomas Hager | date=November 29, 2007 | publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/narrative/page27.html | title=The Right to Petition | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Thomas Hager | date=November 29, 2007 | publisher=Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public pressure and the research results subsequently led to a moratorium on above-ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in 1963 by [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day that the treaty went into force, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded Pauling the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], describing him as "Linus Carl Pauling, who ever since 1946 has campaigned ceaselessly, not only against nuclear weapons tests, not only against the spread of these armaments, not only against their very use, but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts."&lt;ref name=brow&gt;Jerry Brown and [[Rinaldo Brutoco]] (1997).

The [[Sierra Club]] became actively involved.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Raymond Wellock (1998).

Historian [[Thomas Wellock]] traces the birth of the anti-nuclear movement to the controversy over Bodega Bay.&lt;ref name=well/&gt;  Attempts to build a nuclear power plant in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] were similar to those at Bodega Bay and were also abandoned.&lt;ref name=well/&gt;

In 1966, [[Larry Bogart]] founded the [[List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Citizens Energy Council|Citizens Energy Council]], a coalition of environmental groups that published the newsletters "Radiation Perils," "Watch on the A.E.C." and "Nuclear Opponents".  These publications argued that "nuclear power plants were too complex, too expensive and so inherently unsafe they would one day prove to be a financial disaster and a health hazard".&lt;ref&gt;Keith Schneider.

The emergence of the anti-nuclear power movement was "closely associated with the general rise in environmental consciousness which had started to materialize in the USA in the 1960s and quickly spread to other Western industrialized countries".&lt;ref name=rudig/&gt; Some nuclear experts began to voice dissenting views about nuclear power in 1969, and this was a necessary precondition for broad public concern about nuclear power to emerge.&lt;ref name=rudig&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists included [[Ernest Sternglass]] from Pittsburg, [[Henry Way Kendall|Henry Kendall]] from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nobel laureate [[George Wald]] and radiation specialist [[Rosalie Bertell]]. These members of the scientific community "by expressing their concern over nuclear power, played a crucial role in demystifying the issue for other citizens", and nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=rudig/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, 15,000 people demonstrated against French plans to locate the first light-water reactor power plant in [[Bugey Nuclear Power Plant|Bugey]]. This was the first of a series of mass protests organized at nearly every planned nuclear site in France.&lt;ref name=nelkin&gt;Dorothy Nelkin and Michael Pollak (1982).

Also in 1971, the town of [[Wyhl]], in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue.  In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant,&lt;ref name=pub&gt;Stephen Mills and Roger Williams (1986).

This initially centred on the state government's handling of the affair and associated police behaviour, but interest in nuclear issues was also stimulated.  The Wyhl experience encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear sites.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt; Many other anti-nuclear groups formed elsewhere, in support of these local struggles, and some existing citizen action groups widened their aims to include the nuclear issue.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;  Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl also inspired nuclear opposition in the rest of Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=got/&gt;

In 1972, the anti-nuclear weapons movement maintained a presence in the Pacific, largely in response to [[French nuclear testing]] there. Activists, including [[David McTaggart]] from [[Greenpeace]], defied the French government by sailing small vessels into the test zone and interrupting the testing program.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis.

In Spain, in response to a surge in nuclear power plant proposals in the 1960s, a strong anti-nuclear movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately impeded the realisation of most of the projects.&lt;ref name=spain&gt;Lutz Mez, [[Mycle Schneider]] and [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]] (Eds.)

In 1974, organic farmer Sam Lovejoy took a crowbar to the weather-monitoring tower which had been erected at the [[Montague Nuclear Power Plant]] site.

For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track of [[time]]. The current [[sexagesimal]] [[Numeral system|system]] of time [[systems of measurement|measurement]] dates to approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|{{sc|bc}}]]&lt;!--See talk page--&gt; from the  [[Sumer]]ians.

The  Egyptians divided the day into two 12-hour periods, and used large [[obelisk]]s to track the movement of the [[sun]]. They also developed [[water clock]]s, which were probably first used in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], and later outside Egypt as well; they were employed frequently by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who called them ''clepsydrae''. The [[Zhou dynasty]] is believed to have used the outflow water clock around the same time, devices which were introduced from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2000{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.

Other ancient timekeeping devices include the [[candle clock]], used in [[ancient China]], [[ancient Japan]], [[England]] and Mesopotamia; the [[Sundial#Shepherd dials – Timesticks|timestick]], widely used in [[India]] and [[Tibet]], as well as some parts of [[Europe]]; and the [[hourglass]], which functioned similarly to a water clock.  The [[sundial]], another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.  It is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the [[gnomon]] was not aligned with the [[Earth's axis]]).

The earliest known clock with a [[water-power]]ed [[escapement]] mechanism, which transferred [[rotational energy]] into intermittent motions,&lt;ref name="Samual l. Jackson 18f."&gt;David Landes: "Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World", rev. and enlarged edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2000, {{ISBN|0-674-00282-2}}, p.18f.&lt;/ref&gt; dates back to 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} in [[ancient Greece]];&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=343–369 (356f.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science and technology in China|Chinese engineers]] later invented clocks incorporating [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century,&lt;ref name="needham 411"/&gt; followed by [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Iranian engineers]] inventing water clocks driven by [[gear]]s and [[Maintaining power|weights]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Hassan/&gt;

The first [[mechanical clock]]s, employing the [[verge escapement]] mechanism with a [[Balance wheel|foliot]] or [[balance wheel]] timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the [[pendulum clock]] was invented in 1656.  The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.

The pendulum clock remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when [[quartz oscillator]]s were invented, followed by [[atomic clock]]s after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of [[microelectronics]] in the 1960s made [[quartz clock]]s both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and [[wristwatch]]es.

Atomic clocks are far more accurate than any previous timekeeping device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the [[International Atomic Time]]; a [[standardized]] civil system, [[Coordinated Universal Time]], is based on atomic time.

Egyptian shadow clocks divided [[Daytime (astronomy)|daytime]] into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts.&lt;ref name="One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt"/&gt; One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon.&lt;!--Why?--&gt; Obelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time.

It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The ''T'' was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at [[noon]], so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;Barnett, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/hourglass.html |title= How does an hourglass measure time? |accessdate=31 March 2008|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Berlev, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings on the side of the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of [[pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep I]] (1525–1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbin, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using [[Plumb-bob|plumb-lines]] called [[merkhet]]s. In use since at least 600{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, two of these instruments were aligned with [[Polaris]], the north [[pole star]], to create a north–south [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the ''merkhets''.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"&gt;Whitrow, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a [[siphon]]. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer, [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]], supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.
[[File:Aerides Athens 2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Tower of the Winds]] in [[Athens]], Greece, a 1st-century-BC [[clocktower]] from the period of [[Roman Greece]]]]
In Greek tradition, clepsydrae were used in [[court]]; later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted this practice, as well. There are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Plato]] says that "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on".&lt;ref name="Water clocks in court"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H8YOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook|last=Humphrey|first=John William|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=518–519|accessdate=11 April 2008|isbn=0-415-06136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mention occurs in [[Lucius Apuleius]]' ''[[The Golden Ass]]'': "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief witness for the prosecution to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transformations of Lucius, Otherwise Known as The Golden Ass|last=Apuleius|first=Lucius|others=Translated by Robert Graves|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|year=1951|page=54|authorlink3=Apuleius|isbn=0-374-50532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used.

Although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials—they could be used indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as accurate; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QcE2pBCLE8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Empires of Time: Calendars, Clocks, and Cultures|last=Aveni|first=Anthony F.|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2000|isbn=1-86064-602-6|accessdate=22 June 2008|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making the reading of the clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by [[water pressure]]: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman [[horology|horologists]] beginning in 100{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and improvements continued to be made in the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Collier, James Lincoln |title=Clocks |publisher=Benchmark Books |location=[[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], NY |year=2003 |page=25 |isbn=0-7614-1538-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 270{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}500, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] ([[Ctesibius]], [[Hero of Alexandria]], [[Archimedes]]) and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[horology|horologists]] and [[astronomer]]s began developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang [[bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[gong]]s, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed [[astrology|astrological]] models of the universe.

Although the Greeks and Romans did much to advance water clock technology, they still continued to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer [[Theodosius of Bithynia]], for example, is said to have invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor |first=J.

[[File:میرآب.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of the scene of a water clock manager (MirAab), Iran]]
According to [[Callisthenes]], the [[Persia]]ns were using [[water clock]]s in 328{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from [[qanat]]s to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in [[Iran]], especially in [[Zeebad]], dates back to 500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the ''[[Nowruz]]'', ''Chelah'', or ''[[Yaldā]]'' – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.&lt;ref name=Qanat&gt;[http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/science_education/technical/c3c1183387267p1.php/%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86 Conference of Qanat in Iran – water clock in Persia 1383], in Persian&lt;/ref&gt;

Water clocks, or ''Fenjaan'', in Persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a [[qanat]] or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt; Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"&gt;[http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 سايه‌ي شهرداري نجف‌آباد بر كهن‌ترين «ساعت آبي»‌ شهر] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429163019/http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 |date=April 29, 2014 }} Amordad News (in Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"/&gt;

The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as ''khaneh fenjaan''. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a ''staryab'' or [[astrolabe]], but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt;

===Ancient and medieval China===
{{See also|History of science and technology in China|Su Song}}
[[Joseph Needham]] speculated that the introduction of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from [[Mesopotamia]], occurred as far back as the 2nd millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, during the [[Shang Dynasty]], and at the latest by the 1st millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. By the beginning of the [[Han Dynasty]], in 202{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling [[pressure head]] in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, [[Zhang Heng]] added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor [[Shen Kuo]]. Around 610, this design was trumped by two [[Sui Dynasty]] inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the [[steelyard balance]].&lt;ref name=needham&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |pages=479–480 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Needham states that:
{{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;[the balance clepsydra] permitted the seasonal adjustment of the pressure head in the compensating tank by having standard positions for the counterweight graduated on the beam, and hence it could control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night. With this arrangement no overflow tank was required, and the two attendants were warned when the clepsydra needed refilling.&lt;ref name=needham/&gt;}}

==Timekeeping innovations in medieval and pre-modern periods==
The term '[[clock]]' encompasses a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from [[wristwatch]]es to the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. The English word ''clock'' is said to derive from the [[Middle English]] ''clokke'', [[Old French|Old North French]] ''cloque'', or [[Middle Dutch]] ''clocke'', all of which mean ''[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]'', and are derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''clocca'', also meaning bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clock |title=Clock Etymology |accessdate=27 April 2008|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Clock|title=Merriam-Webster Online: Clock|accessdate=20 June 2008|work=[[Webster's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/31/C0413100.html |accessdate=4 December 2007 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-395-82517-2 |author=executive editor, Joseph P.

===Candle clocks===
{{Main|Candle clock}}
[[Image:Kerzenuhr.jpg|thumb|right|A [[candle clock]]]]
The earliest mention of [[candle clock]]s comes from a Chinese poem, written in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}520 by You Jianfu. According to the poem, the graduated candle was a means of determining time at night. Similar candles were used in Japan until the early 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm |title=History of Time |accessdate=8 April 2008 |last=Flamer |first=Keith |year=2006|work=International Watch Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162954/http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm|archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candle clock most commonly mentioned and written of is attributed to King [[Alfred the Great]]. It consisted of six candles made from 72&amp;nbsp;[[pennyweight]]s of wax, each {{convert|12|in|cm}} high, and of uniform thickness, marked every inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm). As these candles burned for about four hours, each mark represented 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Once lit, the candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes, to prevent the flame from extinguishing.&lt;ref name="alfred"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |url=http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |title=Clockworks: Candle clock |accessdate=16 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126001057/http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated candle clocks of their time were those of [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206.

Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;}}

[[Image:Oil-lamp clock00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[oil-lamp clock]]]]

A variation on this theme were [[oil-lamp clock]]s. These early timekeeping devices consisted of a graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.

===Incense clocks===
{{Main article|Incense clock}}
In addition to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, [[incense clock]]s were used in the [[Far East]], and were fashioned in several different forms.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Incense]] clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the [[Shōsōin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eastern Magnificence and European Ingenuity: Clocks of Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8bXxHSZkWssC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA209,M1|last=Pagani|first=Catherine|page=209|isbn=0-472-11208-2|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its characters are not Chinese, but [[Devanagari]].&lt;ref name="Schafer"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QerLX9x8pIkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics|pages=160–161|last=Schafer|first=Edward|year=1963|isbn=0-520-05462-8|publisher=[[University of California Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in [[Buddhist]] ceremonies, [[Edward H.

Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance,&lt;ref name="Burning rates"/&gt; these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Bedini103"&gt;Bedini, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it&lt;ref name="Burning rates"/&gt; into which incense was placed.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; These clocks were common in China,&lt;ref name="Bedini103"/&gt; but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"/&gt; To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails.

While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the [[Song dynasty]]. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"&gt;Bedini, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sundials===
{{Main|Sundial}}
[[Image:SevillaGlorietaDelReloj01.JPG|thumb|A 20th-century [[sundial]] in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]], Spain]]
Sundials had been used for timekeeping since [[Ancient Egypt]]. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. Every day was divided into 12&amp;nbsp;equal segments regardless of the time of year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The [[sundial]] was further developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]]. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in 1371, based on earlier developments in [[trigonometry]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī]] (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that "using a [[gnomon]] that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year". His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the sundial |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=2 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010044606/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Sundial And Geometry|first=Lawrence|last=Jones|journal=North American Sundial Society|volume=12|issue=4|date=December 2005|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acceptance of [[heliocentrism]] and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the [[Renaissance]], when they were built in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Mayall, Margaret W. |author2=Mayall, R.

===Hourglass===
{{Main|Hourglass}}
Since the [[hourglass]] was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting ''Allegory of Good Government'', by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], from 1338.&lt;ref&gt;Frugoni p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices.

[It] was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit&amp;nbsp;... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000817/081712eo.pdf |title=The mechanical clock |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |accessdate=16 April 2008 | date=October 1988|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Yi Xing's clock was a [[water clock]], it was affected by temperature variations. That problem was solved in 976 by [[Zhang Sixun]] by replacing the water with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which remains liquid down to {{convert|-39|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Zhang implemented the changes into his [[clock tower]], which was about {{convert|10|m}} tall, with escapements to keep the clock turning and bells to signal every quarter-hour. Another noteworthy clock, the elaborate Cosmic Engine, was built by [[Su Song]], in 1088. It was about the size of Zhang's tower, but had an automatically rotating [[armillary sphere]]—also called a celestial globe—from which the positions of the stars could be observed. It also featured five panels with [[mannequins]] ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] in horology.&lt;ref name="needham 411"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |page=411 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in the capital of [[Kaifeng]], it was dismantled by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin army]] and sent to the capital of [[Fanyang|Yanjing]] (now [[Beijing]]), where they were unable to put it back together.

[[Clock tower]]s in [[Western Europe]] in the Middle Ages were also sometimes [[striking clock]]s.

In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called ''Due Mori'' (''Two [[Moors]]''), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the [[Prague Astronomical Clock]] by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker [[Mikuláš of Kadaň]] and mathematician [[Jan Šindel]].

The religious necessities and technical skill of the medieval monks were crucial factors in the development of clocks, as the historian [[Thomas Woods]] writes:
{{quote|text=The monks also counted skillful clock-makers among them. The first recorded clock was built by the future [[Pope Sylvester II]] for the German town of [[Magdeburg]], around the year 996.

[[Salisbury cathedral clock]], dating from about 1386, is one of the oldest working clocks in the world, and may be the oldest.

The framework is held together with metal dowels and pegs.  Two large stones, hanging from pulleys, supply the power. As the weights fall, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels.

During the Middle Ages, clocks primarily served religious purposes; the first employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century.

====Wristwatch====
{{Main article|Wristwatch|history of watches}}
[[File:Leicester as Governor-General engraving by Goltzius.jpg|thumb|upright|right|One of the earliest references to a wristwatch – an 'arm watch' given to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] by her favourite [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]].]]
The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. [[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was not just a matter of fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the [[waistcoat]] was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], the consort to [[Queen Victoria]], introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as [[bracelet]]s, for women.&lt;ref name="Evolu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=THe Evolution of the Wristwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

During the [[Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin &amp; Webb]] began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at the Sudan in 1898]] and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

[[File:First Battle of Passchendaele - barrage map (colour balance).jpg|thumb|right|Planning map for an Allied creeping barrage at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] – a tactic that required precise synchronisation between the artillery and infantry.]]
These early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Frères &amp; Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], an early aviator, asked his friend, a French [[watchmaker]] called [[Louis Cartier]], to design a watch that could be useful during his flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lego Mindstorms NXT Hacker's Guide|last=Prochnow|first=Dave|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=0-07-148147-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches. His Rolex wristwatch of 1910 became the first such watch to receive certification as a chronometer in Switzerland and it went on to win an award in 1914 from [[Kew Observatory]] in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|author=John E. Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed in the air as much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British [[War Office|War Department]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Paul|title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight|publisher=Hyperion Press|year=2004|isbn=0-7868-8571-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cortjump1.jpg|thumb|A ''Cortébert'' wristwatch from the 1920s.|left]]
The company H. Williamson Ltd., based in [[Coventry]], was one of the first to capitalize on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] it was noted that "...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can." By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on – the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that "...the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire." Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

====Equation clock====
{{Main|Equation clock}}
In the late 17th and 18th Centuries, [[equation clock]]s were made, which allowed the user to see or calculate apparent [[solar time]], as would be shown by a [[sundial]]. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the [[equation of time]] made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.

Astronomers in particular needed a better tool for timing the transit of stars and thereby creating more accurate maps of the heavens. The pendulum proved to be the key to boosting the accuracy and dependability of timekeepers. [[Galileo Galilei]], the Italian physicist and astronomer, and others before him experimented with pendulums, but a young Dutch astronomer and mathematician named Christiaan Huygens devised the first pendulum clock on Christmas Day in 1656. (...) Pendulum clocks were about 100 times as accurate as their predecessors, reducing a typical gain or loss of 15 minutes a day to about a minute a week. News of the invention spread rapidly, and by 1660 English and French artisans were developing their own versions of this new timekeeper. &lt;br/&gt; In 1675 Huygens devised his next major improvement, the spiral balance spring. (...) The spiral balance spring revolutionized the accuracy of watches, enabling them to keep time to within a minute a day. This advance sparked an almost immediate rise in the market for watches, which were now no longer typically worn on a chain around the neck but were carried in a pocket, a wholly new fashion in clothing." |date=1 February 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was "the most ingenious watchmaker of all time" (in [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]'s own words).&lt;ref&gt;Gindikin, Simon; Shuchat, Alan (2007).

To avoid the need for a very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39&amp;nbsp;inches) long to the center of the bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/clock.htm|title=How Pendulum Clocks Work|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by [[Daniel Quare]], a London clock-maker, and the Second Hand was introduced.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were another major contributor to the development of pendulum clocks in the 17th and 18th centuries, having had an "unusually keen appreciation of the importance of precision".&lt;ref name="Woods100"&gt;Woods, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods103"&gt;Woods, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In measuring an accurate one-second pendulum, for example, the Italian astronomer Father [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] persuaded nine fellow Jesuits "to count nearly 87,000 oscillations in a single day".&lt;ref name="Woods103"/&gt; They served a crucial role in spreading and testing the scientific ideas of the period, and collaborated with contemporary scientists, such as Huygens.&lt;ref name="Woods100"/&gt;

The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the [[balance wheel]] in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist [[Robert Hooke]] (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the actual inventor of the [[balance spring]]. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day.  The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a [[harmonic oscillator]] like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed [[resonant frequency]] and resisted oscillating at other rates.  This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day,&lt;ref name="nistrevolution"/&gt; resulting in the addition of the [[Clock face|minute hand]] to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13458392&amp;search_terms=DTL59|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1737|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Like the invention of [[pendulum clock]], Huygens' spiral [[hairspring]] ([[balance spring]]) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern [[watchmaking]] industry.

In 1675, Huygens and [[Robert Hooke]] invented the [[spiral balance]], or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the [[balance wheel]]. This crucial advance finally made accurate [[pocket watch]]es possible.&lt;ref name="Pockets"/&gt;  This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes per day, similar to the effect of the pendulum upon mechanical clocks.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Milham | first= Willis I. | title=Time and Timekeepers | year=1945 | publisher=MacMillan | location=New York | isbn=0-7808-0008-7|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.&lt;ref name="histworld"&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF CLOCKS|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented the rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, which was a great improvement over the previous mechanism. The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.

===Marine chronometer===
{{Main|Marine chronometer}}
[[File:Harrison H4 clock in The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper 1767.jpg|thumb|left|Drawings of [[John Harrison|Harrison]]'s H4 [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] of 1761, published in ''The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper'', 1767.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aB8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Marine chronometer]]s are clocks used at sea as [[time standard]]s, to determine [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref name=marinechrono/&gt;
A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would have to keep the time of a fixed location—usually [[Greenwich Mean Time]]—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock.&lt;ref name=marinechrono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nawcc.org/museum/nwcm/galleries/marine/marine.htm |title=Marine Chronometers Gallery |accessdate=20 May 2008 |publisher=[[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manitoba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html |title=Science News – The Marine Chronometer |accessdate=20 May 2008 |first=Jérôme |last=Marchildon |publisher=[[Manitoba Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919035618/http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html|archivedate=September 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longitudeprize&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |title=Chronometers, precision watches, and timekeepers |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |location=[[Greenwich]] |accessdate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029165741/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

[[Image:MIH-film12 color cerrected denoise.jpg|thumb|right|A twin-barrel box chronometer.]]
After the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]] where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large [[longitude prize|prize]] of £20,000, equivalent to millions of pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by [[Yorkshire]] carpenter [[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.

In 1735 Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.

The chronometer was trialled in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

[[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], a Scottish clock and instrument maker, was the first to invent and patent the [[electric clock]] in 1840.

Atomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in practical use today. Accurate to within a few seconds over many thousands of years, they are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DNwfG5hQ7-YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PA484,M1|title=Sky and Ocean Joined: The U.S. Naval Observatory, 1830–2000|last=Dick|first=Stephen|page=484|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81599-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clock and watch-making industry==
{{Main article|Clockmaking|Watchmaking}}
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|A [[pocket watch]]]]
The first professional clockmakers came from the [[guild]]s of [[locksmith]]s and [[jeweller]]s. Clockmaking developed from a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years.&lt;ref name="Davies435" /&gt;

[[Paris]] and [[Blois]] were the early centres of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as [[Julien Le Roy]], clockmaker of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], were leaders in case design and ornamental clocks.&lt;ref name="Davies435"&gt;Davies, Norman; p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy belonged to the fifth generation of a family of clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as "the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, a face that could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500&amp;nbsp;watches. The competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately.&lt;ref name="Leroy"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Getty Center]]|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=556 |title=Julien Le Roy |accessdate=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1794 and 1795, in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], the French government briefly mandated [[decimal time|decimal clocks]], with a day divided into 10&amp;nbsp;hours of 100&amp;nbsp;minutes each.&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;Alder, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer and mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; A clock in the [[Palais des Tuileries]] kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread.&lt;ref name="Alder162"&gt;Alder, pp. 150–162&lt;/ref&gt; Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the [[metric system]], and it was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Alder162"/&gt;

In Germany, [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]] were the early clockmaking centers, and the [[Black Forest]] came to specialize in wooden [[cuckoo clocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Antiques|last=Shull|first=Thelma|publisher=C. E. Tuttle Co.|year=1963|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pocketwatch movement.png|thumb|left|220px|An antique pocket watch movement, from an 1891 encyclopedia.]]
The English became the predominant clockmakers of the 17th and 18th centuries. The main centres of the British industry were in the [[City of London]], the [[West End of London]], [[Soho]] where many skilled French [[Huguenot]]s settled and later in [[Clerkenwell]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] was established in 1631 as one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the City of London.

[[Thomas Tompion]] was the first English clockmaker with an international reputation and many of his pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury [[pendulum]], and his pupil [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] who created the first [[lever escapement]]. Famous clockmakers of this period included [[Joseph Windmills]], Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and [[Christopher Pinchbeck]] who invented the alloy [[Pinchbeck (alloy)|pinchbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22169|title=Clock and Watch-Making|publisher=British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later famous horologists included [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] who made the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, [[Thomas Earnshaw]] who was the first to make these available to the public, [[Daniel Quare]], who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand.

Quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By the rise of [[consumerism]] in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England: Where watchmaking all began|url=http://www.watchpro.com/england-where-watchmaking-all-began/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following the influx of [[Huguenot]] craftsmen, and in the 19th century, the Swiss industry "gained worldwide supremacy in high-quality machine-made watches". The leading firm of the day was [[Patek Philippe]], founded by [[Antoni Patek]] of [[Warsaw]] and [[Adrien Philippe]] of [[Bern]].&lt;ref name="Davies435"/&gt;

The '''Hsinchu Science Park''' ({{zh|t=新竹科學工業園區|p=Xīnzhú Kēxué Gōngyè Yuánqū|poj=Sin-tek Kho-ha̍k Kang-gia̍p Hn̂g-khu}}) is an [[industrial park]] established by the government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] on December 15, 1980. It straddles [[Hsinchu City]] and [[Hsinchu County]] in Taiwan.

The idea of the establishment of the Hsinchu Science Park was first proposed by [[Shu Shien-Siu]], the former President of [[National Tsing Hua University]] and [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)|Minister of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=張|first1=仲瑋|title=淺談前校長徐賢修先生|url=http://my.nthu.edu.tw/~secretar2/pub/147/5/1.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Shu became the Minister of Science and Technology in 1973, he traveled to the United States, Europe, Japan, and South Korea to learn and study their conditions of the development of science and technology. In 1976, Shu came up with the idea of building a science and technology park like that of [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] proposed to build the park in [[Longtan District, Taoyuan|Longtan District]] because of the potential future benefits that could be drawn from [[National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology]] and the military. However, Shu argued that the technology and science park should not be close to the military as the primary goal of the founding of the park is to expand the size of [[private economy]] and creative vitality of Taiwan. Shu's idea was to build the park in [[Hsinchu]] next to the [[National Tsing Hua University]] and [[National Chiao Tung University]] like the Silicon Valley, which is adjacent to [[Stanford University]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Shu's idea was ultimately approved by Chiang and the park was built and opened in 1980 in [[Hsinchu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=志仁|first1=王|title=散播科技聚落的基因　徐賢修|url=http://www.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=5035700|website=天下雜誌|publisher=天下雜誌|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original idea of the establishment of the science park and the location of the park were settled, Chiang Ching-kuo assigned the task of constructing the Hsinchu Science Park. [[Kwoh-Ting Li]], former Finance Minister of the Republic of China, was among those who significantly contributed to the founding of the park, as ordered by Chiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipa.gov.tw/home.jsp?mserno=201001210113&amp;serno=201001210118&amp;serno3=201002250007&amp;menudata=ChineseMenu&amp;contlink=content/20years_10.jsp&amp;level3=Y|title=壹、科學園區的推手|first=|last=企劃組|date=16 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Silicon Valley, Li consulted [[Frederick Terman]] on how Taiwan could follow its example. From there, Li convinced talents who had gone abroad to build companies in this new Silicon Valley in Taiwan.  Among those who returned is [[Morris Chang]], who later led the [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]] (ITRI) and founded the [[TSMC]]. Li also introduced the concept of venture capital to the country to attract funds to finance high-tech startups in Taiwan.

==Overview==
The Hsinchu Science Park (HSP) is now one of the world's most significant centers for [[semiconductor manufacturing]], industrial and [[computer]] technology development. More than 400 high-tech companies, mainly involved in the semiconductor, computer, telecommunication, and optoelectronics industries, have been established in the park since the end of December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | last = Central News Agency | title = Hsinchu Science Park export value grows, large growth for optoelectronics
| work = Department of Investment Services (Taiwan)| publisher = MOEA| date = 2007-06-26 | url = http://investintaiwan.nat.gov.tw/en/news/200706/2007062601.html| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 400 technology companies accounted for 10% of Taiwan's gross domestic product in 2007. It is home to the world's top two [[foundry|semiconductor foundries]], Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ([[TSMC]]) and [[United Microelectronics Corporation]] (UMC), both of which were established at the nearby [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]]. Taiwan is the only country that possesses a professional division-of-labor system in the semiconductor industry and also has the highest density of 12-inch wafer-producing fabs, most of which are based in the park.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| last = National Science Council| title = Hsinchu Science Park| publisher = Government of Taiwan| year = 2005| url = http://web1.nsc.gov.tw/mp.aspx?mp=7| accessdate = 7/12/2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Next door to the science park are two of Taiwan's science and engineering powerhouses, [[National Chiao Tung University]] and [[National Tsing Hua University]], and the [[National Space Organization]], the Taiwanese space agency, is located in the park. There is also a science-themed [[amusement park]] nearby.

There were local residents' protests against water and air pollution. The Park's industrial wastewater treatment plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pavo.sipa.gov.tw/wastewater/|title=園區污水處理廠介紹|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to operate in 1986 and effectively treats wastewater for maximum safety while [[Taiwan]]'s National Environmental Protection Department monitors the air quality in the Park and surrounding areas to maintain clean air quality.

==Locations==
Currently, the Hsinchu Science Park covers six locations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipa.gov.tw/english/index.jsp|title=Hsinchu Science Park|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ip.access was founded in December 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ttp.com/corporate/about/ |title= About TTP |publisher= TTP Group |accessdate= June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of TTP Group PLC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttpgroup.com/about/TTP TTP Group PLC]&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at developing technologies that would allow multiple radio access technologies to communicate over the Internet. To accommodate its growing staff, in 2006 ip.access relocated to new offices in Cambourne Business Park, Cambridge, where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |url=http://www.ipaccess.com/content/news/press.php?id=20 |title=ip.access Moves to New Offices to Support Growth |publisher= ip.access| accessdate= June 3, 2011 | date=September 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, TTP Group spun off its communications division (TTP Communications, or TTPCom) in an [[initial public offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]], and ip.access joined the spin-off as a wholly owned subsidiary of the TTPCom group.

In March 2006, the company secured an £8.5 million round of funding from [[Intel Capital]], Scottish Equity Partners, and [[Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |url= http://www.ipaccess.com/content/news/press.php?id=27 |title=ip.access Secures £8.5 million Funding to Accelerate Growth in Cost-Effective Cellular Infrastructure for Homes and Businesses |publisher= ip.access| accessdate= June 3, 2011 | date=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its June 2006 acquisition of TTP Communications, [[Motorola]] also gained a stake in ip.access.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/07/motorola_buys_ttpcom/ Motorola gobbles up TTPcom], ''The Register'', June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, after signing an OEM agreement with ip.access, [[ADC Telecommunications|ADC]]&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Ken.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10261">The '''knowledge divide''' is the gap in standards of living between those who can find, create, manage, process, and disseminate information or knowledge, and those who are impaired in this process. According to a 2005 UNESCO World Report, the rise in the 21st century of a global information society has resulted in the emergence of knowledge as a valuable resource, increasingly determining who has access to power and profit.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Report: Toward Knowledge Societies (Paris: UNESCO, 2005), 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid dissemination of information on a potentially global scale as a result of new information media&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and the globally uneven ability to assimilate knowledge and information has resulted in potentially expanding gaps in knowledge between individuals and nations.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, "Knowledge as a Global Public Good," in Global Public Goods: International Cooperation in the 21st Century, ed. I. Kahl et al. (Oxford University Press, 1999), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

In the 21st century, the emergence of the [[knowledge society]] becomes pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]] World Report (2005) Towards Knowledge Societies; retrieved from http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001418/141843e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The transformations of world's economy and of each society have a fast pace. Together with information and communication technologies ([[Information technology|ICT]]) these new paradigms have the power to reshape the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Information Society Commission (2002). Building the Knowledge Society - Report to Government, December 2002 retrieved from http://www.isc.ie/downloads/know.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep pace with innovations, to come up with new ideas, people need to produce and manage knowledge. This is why knowledge has become essential for all societies.

==Between nations==

According to [[UNESCO]] and the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report: Knowledge for Development (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge gaps between nations may occur due to the varying degrees by which individual nations incorporate the following elements:

* ''Human rights and fundamental freedoms'': An absence of freedom within a society can diminish or delay the ability of its members to acquire, debate, and transmit knowledge.  Vital to the spread of knowledge and information between nations are such freedoms as [[freedom of expression]], an absence of censorship, free circulation of information, and [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Democracy]]''
* ''Plurality of knowledge and information'': This includes a diverse media&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the acceptance of diverse forms of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Quality infrastructure'': For instance, a poor electrical grid makes the existence of computer networks or of higher education institutions less attainable.
* ''Effective communication system'': This will affect the dissemination of knowledge or movement of ideas within and between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Effective education system'': Gaps in knowledge between nations can exist when individual countries invest too little in primary school education, which acts as the base for the entire education system.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[UNESCO]], in order for a nation to become a knowledge society, primary education must focus on basic literacy and must be universally accessible.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as others have pointed out, higher education may be equally important for closing knowledge gaps between nations, particularly between newly industrialized nations, such as the Republic of Korea, and more advanced industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the former, higher education can play an important role in bridging knowledge gaps, but must benefit more than a small elite portion of the population and must be taught at international standards.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The poor development of educational institutions from a society affects the creativity of people belonging to that society.
* ''Focus on Research and Innovation'': As the [[World Bank]] suggests, [[Research &amp; Development]] within a nation can enable it to follow current developments in global knowledge and also to understand how to adapt external knowledge and technology to meet its needs.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  In nations with low degrees of R&amp;D, government funding can provide a significant portion of support that can later be taken over by private investment.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Closely tied to effective education systems is the need for a nation to allow for academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because higher educational institutions are significant contributors to R&amp;D,&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; these institutions must be granted freedom to create and disseminate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  An environment supportive of research and innovation may also help stem the "[[brain drain]]" of educated individuals from knowledge-poor nations to knowledge-rich nations.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Intellectual Property Rights'': Closely connected to a focus on research and innovation are national and international Intellectual Property Rights. Within a nation, Intellectual Property Rights can spawn research and innovation by providing economic incentives for investing in new knowledge development.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as stated by the [[World Bank]], by protecting innovations, intellectual property rights may also inhibit knowledge-sharing and may prevent developing nations from benefitting from knowledge produced in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report 1999, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital divide==

The information and ICT systems that support knowledge are very important. This is why digitization is viewed closely related to knowledge. Scientists generally agree that there is a [[digital divide]], recently different reports also showed the existence of knowledge divide.&lt;ref&gt;Information Society Commission, 2002; UNESCO, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation and effective use of knowledge are increasingly related to the development of an ICT infrastructure. Without ICT, it is impossible to have an infrastructure able to process the huge flow of information required in an advanced economy. In particular, without adequate technical support, it is difficult to develop and use e-learning and electronic documents to overcome time and space constraints.

The digital divide is, however, but one important part of the larger knowledge divide.  As UNESCO states, "closing the digital divide will not suffice to close the knowledge divide, for access to useful, relevant knowledge is more than simply a matter of infrastructure—it depends on training, cognitive skills and regulatory frameworks geared towards access to contents."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

In the book Digital Dead End, Virginia Eubanks criticizes the way that the digital divide is generally thought of as a division between haves and have-nots, where the solution is distribution. This over simplistic depiction obscures the fact that often social and [[structural inequality]] is at the root of the divide. According to a study done by Eubanks with women of the YWCA, the women of the community "insisted that have-nots possess many different kinds of crucial information and skills." In other words, it is not simply knowledge of the technology itself that is the issue but the structural system based on perpetuating the status quo in which the haves "hoard" knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Eubanks, V. (2011). Digital dead end: fighting for social justice in the information age. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In gender, race, ethnicity and social class==

First, it was noticed that a great difference exists between the [[North-South divide|North and the South]] {{Where|date=July 2011}} (rich countries vs. poor countries). The development of knowledge depends on spreading Internet and computer technology and also on the development of education in these countries. If a country has attained a higher literacy level then this will result in having higher level of knowledge.
Indeed, UNESCO's report details many social issues in knowledge divide related to globalization. There was noticed a knowledge divide with respect to
* Gender: Socio-cultural inequalities between men and women, such as unequal access to education and technology, create the conditions for unequal access to knowledge.  This can cause significant knowledge gaps both within and between nations, the latter resulting from individual nations' underutilization of their full knowledge workforce.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Report 2005, 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Race
* Ethnicity
* Social class

==Media coverage==
[[TechCrunch]] identified that, compared to other markets, the fees charged by legal practitioners are traditionally non transparent, and considered Lexoo “a classic example of how markets can be made more efficient and transparent by moving them online”.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/16/lexoo/|title=Lexoo Scores $400K For Its Lawyer-Matching Service For Small Businesses|last1=O’Hear|first1=Steve|date=16 January 2015|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35068">This is a '''list of [[Technopole|technology centers]]''' throughout the world.  Governmental planners and business networks like to use the name "silicon" or "valley" to describe their own areas as a result of the success of [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]].  Nevertheless, there are a few qualitative differences between these places, and metrics may be applied to measure their dominance.

These metrics include:
* How much and to what extent public and/or private research and development funds are spent in the zones
* What percentage of local employment is technology related.
* If the zone is mainly government funded or is mainly corporate driven (or both)
* If mainly corporate, how much revenue and profit and which corporates have headquarters there.
* If mainly corporate, how much [[venture capital]] has been made available to companies in the zone.
* What supporting higher educational institutions are located in nearby.

== Globally Prominent clusters (with specific dominant markets listed) ==
&lt;!-- Note: this area should be a summary of major globally dominant in a particular field.  If there isnt a particular market to point out, it does not belong in this section, but the worldiwde list section below--&gt;
 {{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
*[[Silicon Valley]] - originating in Stanford University (Palo Alto and Menlo Park), and spreading south towards [[San Jose, California]] and suburbs. San Francisco and nearby areas including Berkeley and Oakland are technically not part of Silicon Valley but have seen growth in industries such as [[web development]] (2013-2016) and [[venture capital]].  Silicon Valley has maintained dominance for decades in core industries such as microprocessor development as well as software and web development.  
*[[Silicon Wadi]] - is an area with a high concentration of [[high-tech]] industries&lt;ref name="Viva Tel Aviv"/&gt; in the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|coastal plain]] in [[Israel]]. [[Israel]] as a whole country has strong innovation in Cyber Security, Agritech and more. The Silicon Wadi area covers much of the country, although especially high concentrations of hi-tech industry can be found in the area around [[Tel Aviv]], including small clusters around the cities of [[Ra'anana]], [[Petah Tikva]], [[Herzliya]], [[Netanya]], the academic city of [[Rehovot]] and its neighbour [[Rishon Le Zion]]. In addition, hi-tech clusters can be found in [[Haifa]] and [[Caesarea, Israel|Caesarea]]. More recent hi-tech establishments have been raised in [[Jerusalem]] ([[Jerusalem Technology Park|Technology Park, Malha]], [[Har Hotzvim]] and [[Jerusalem Venture Partners|JVP Media Quarter]] in [[Talpiot]]), and the [[Startup Village, Yokneam|Startup Village Ecosystem in the Yokneam area]].
*[[Silicon Fen]] - is the name given to the region around Cambridge, England, which is home to a large cluster of high-tech businesses focusing on software, electronics and biotechnology. Many of these businesses have connections with the University of Cambridge, and the area is now one of the most important technology centres in Europe.
*[[Shenzhen Hi-Tech Industrial Park]] - [[Shenzhen, Guangdong]], China Shenzhen municipality and surrounds, including [[Dongguan]]'s factories had been for a decade the world's dominant peripheral hardware suppliers.  More recently Shenzhen has become the dominant place worldwide for hardware startups (excluding microprocessors, chip memory, and [[pure-play semiconductor foundry]]).
*[[Suwon]], [[Korea]] or ''Samsung Digital City'' is the dominant place worldwide for [[Semiconductor memory|chip memory]] and integrated [[system on a chip]] with large components of microchip memory.
*[[Hsinchu Science Park]] - [[Hsinchu City]] and [[Hsinchu County]], [[Taiwan]] is the dominant place worldwide for [[pure-play semiconductor foundry]] market.
*[[India]] as a whole is globally dominant in software technology outsourcing, famous for Silicon City, [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]]. [[Technopark, Trivandrum]] is the Asia's largest IT Park situated at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[India]].
*[[Thailand]] as a whole is globally dominant in [[hard disk]] manufacturing.
*[[CERN]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] is globally dominant in [[particle physics]].
*[[Dulles Technology Corridor]] is globally dominant in telecom, satellite, and defense industries.
*[[Silicon Alley]] or NYC is globally dominant in [[fintech]] although Shenzhen is also coming up strong in this area.
*[[Tsukuba|Tsukuba Science City]], [[Japan]] has the largest budget of government-sponsored general research and development for any science park zone of its size.

The '''Ministry of Education, Culture and Science''' ({{lang-nl|Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschappen}}; OCW) is the [[Ministries of the Netherlands|Dutch Ministry]] responsible for [[Education in the Netherlands|education]], [[Culture of the Netherlands|culture]], [[science]], [[research]], [[gender equality]] and [[communication]]s. The Ministry was created in 1918 as the Ministry of Education, Arts and Sciences and had several name changes before it became the Education, Culture and Science in 1994. The Ministry is headed by the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, currently [[Ingrid van Engelshoven]].

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

==Responsibilities==
The mission of the ministry is to "work for a smart, able and creative Netherlands". The ministry is responsible for three fields of policy:
* The whole of [[education]], from [[kindergarten]], via [[primary education]] and [[secondary education]] to [[vocational training]] and [[higher education]];
* [[Culture]], [[arts]] and the [[public broadcasting]];
* [[Science]] and [[innovation]].

==Organisation==
The ministry is currently headed by one minister and one [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|State Secretary]]. The ministry's main office is located in the [[Hoftoren]], the tallest building of [[The Hague]]. The ministry has around 2500 civil servants. The civil service is headed by a secretary general and a deputy secretary general, who head a system of three directorates general:
* Primary and Secondary Education;
* Higher Education, Professional Training and Sciences;
* and Culture and Media.

It has several autonomous agencies:
* Central Financial Institution, which is responsible for the execution of financial policies:
* Institute Collection Netherlands;
* National Archive;
* Government Service for Archeology, Cultural Landscape and Monuments;
* Education Inspection;
* Cultural Conservation Inspection;
* Council for Science and Technology; Policy;
* Council for Education;
* and the Council for Culture.

==History==
The predecessor of the ministry, the Ministry of Education, Arts and Sciences was founded in 1918, as it became autonomous from the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]]. It was founded as a result of the resolution of the [[School struggle (Netherlands)|school struggle]], the conflict about the equalisation of the finance for religious and public schools. During the [[Netherlands in World War II|German occupation]] the ministry was renamed Department for Education, Sciences and Cultural Conservation and a separate Department for Propaganda and Arts. In 1965 the department for arts was integrated into the new Ministry of Culture, Recreation and Social Work. In 1982 this cultural department was integrated into the [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Ministry of Health]]. In 1996 cultural department returned to the Ministry of Education.

''The term '''mobile to mobile calling''' is used in many [[mobile phone]] plans to refer to making calls to other mobile phones using the same provider's network--which is often cheaper than other calls.''

'''Mobile to mobile convergence''' (MMC) is a term to describe a [[technology]] used in modern [[computing]] and [[telephony]].  The term is an offshoot of [[fixed mobile convergence]] (FMC) and uses dual mode ([[cellular network]] and [[WiFi]]) phones with a special [[software]] [[client (computing)|client]] and an [[application server]] to connect voice calls and business [[application software|applications]] via a [[VoWLAN]] and/or through a cellular service.  

Mobile to mobile convergence differs from conventional FMC in that the technology uses the [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] to route calls via the [[internet]] as a primary function, and uses the [[wireless carrier]] network if the WLAN is not present as a secondary function.  It is significant since it is viewed as a means to compete with carrier companies since the calls are routed around the cellular network.  This is viewed as a more efficient use of networking technology than standard FMC solutions that are available as well, since most of the latter use the carrier network as the primary means of communication and do not leverage the lower cost and controls of [[internet protocol]]-based networks that are generally installed at most modern businesses.  In theory, it also provides the capability of providing a greater voice coverage area than either carrier or WLAN technology alone since some areas do not have cellular service coverage and others do not have WiFi.

The first offering known in the market successfully deploying MMC is beCherry, which is delivered by Belgian company Mondial Telecom. They offer a MMC solution on [[Symbian]], [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Other smartphone OS's are also considered.

A '''Mobile Station Roaming Number''' ('''MSRN''') is an [[E.164]] defined telephone number used to route telephone calls in a mobile network from a GMSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Centre) to the target MSC (see [[Network Switching Subsystem]]). It can also be defined as a directory number temporarily assigned to a mobile for a mobile terminated call. A MSRN is assigned for every mobile terminated call, not only the calls where the terminating MS lives on a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] specification indicates that the MSC and VLR ([[Visitor Location Register]]) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message. In particular the MSRN is used into an MNP scenario (in this case it can be modified as 'RgN + MSISDN'

A '''mobile form ''' is an electronic or digital form application that functions on a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet device]]. Mobile forms enable users to collect [[data]] using [[mobile device]]s, and then to send the results back to the source. Mobile forms exist to replace paper forms as a more productive means of [[data collection]], eliminating the need to [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] or scan paper data results into a back office system.

Depending on the [[mobile form]] [[App (computing)|application]] provider, some mobile form solutions allow offices to dispatch data to mobile form applications. In addition, other mobile form applications can be connected with various [[cloud service]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], and [[social media platform]]s.

Depending on the business, the motivating factors to deploying mobile forms may vary. Some businesses implement mobile forms to speed up processes, while others institute mobile forms with field users to reduce [[cost]]s associated with transporting paper forms back and forth. Furthermore, [[Green business|green-minded businesses]] implement mobile forms in order to be more environmentally friendly, thus reducing their reliance on paper, ink printing, and subsequent waste.

Advanced mobile form features include [[signature]] capture, [[bar code]] capture, photo capture, [[GPS]] location form info, time form info, and skip logic.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Uses for mobile forms include:
* [[Safety inspection]]s 
* [[Work order]]s
* [[Expense report]]s
* [[Inventory]] reports
* [[Merchandise]] requisition
* [[Invoice|Invoicing]]

'''Mobile ticketing''' is the process whereby customers can order, pay for, obtain and/or validate [[electronic ticket|ticket]]s using [[mobile phone]]s.  Mobile tickets reduce the production and distribution costs connected with traditional paper-based ticketing channels and increase customer [[convenience]] by providing new and simple ways to purchase tickets.

Mobile tickets should not be confused with E-Tickets (electronic tickets) which are used by airlines since 1994, they can be sent by e-mail, printed and shown at the check-in desk at the airport to obtain a boarding pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IATA Press Release No.: 25, Date: 31 May 2008|URL=https://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2008-31-05-01.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many train and bus operators in Europe have created phone apps in which tickets can be bought and stored. These include but are not limited to  [[SJ AB|SJ]], [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], [[Norwegian State Railways|NSB]], [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] and selected local transit authorities.

== History ==

Philips and Sony developed near field communication (NFC) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia, Philips And Sony Establish The Near Field Communication (NFC) Forum|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628203003/http://www.nfc-forum.org/news/pr/view?item_key=d8968a33b4812e2509e5b74247d1366dc8ef91d8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is build on the same basis as common contactless smartcards. Philips published an early paper on NFC in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{
    cite web|title=Near Field Communication, Philips, 2004
    |url=http://www.sacg.com.tw/sacweb/marcom/epaper/images/NFC.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the NFC Forum was established.
NFC incorporated in a mobile phone allows all kind of novel contactless applications, mobile ticketing being an important one of them.
Mobile Tickets can be purchased via internet and will be downloaded in a few seconds to the mobile phone, be it in an sms with a 2-D barcode or to the connected NFC chip. In case of NFC at entrance the phone just has to be touched to the scanning device (in fact it makes contact within 10&amp;nbsp;cm). The GSM Association, GSMA, published a whitepaper on M-Ticketing in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GSMS M-Ticketing Whitepaper|URL=http://nfc-forum.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GSMA-Mobile-Ticketing-White-Paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It describes extensively the use and advantages of M-Ticketing, principally the use of NFC technology. They state that NFC is the best technology but "it is expected however that M-Ticketing services using SMS and Bar Code implementations will be prevalent until the point that a critical mass of NFC enabled handsets is available."

'''Nanosocialism''' refers generally to a set of [[economics|economic theories]] of [[social organization]] advocating [[State (polity)|state]] or [[collective ownership]] and administration of the [[research and development|research, development]] and use of [[nanotechnology]].

== Politics ==

{{further|Regulation of nanotechnology}}

Nanosocialism is a stance that favors [[participatory politics]] to guide [[state intervention]] in the effort to manage the transition to a [[society]] revolutionized by [[molecular nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Berube 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Berube, David|    title = Nanosocialism|    year = 1996 |   url = http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/nanosoc.htm| accessdate=2007-01-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061225060622/http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/nanosoc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[James Hughes (sociologist)|Hughes, James]]|    title = Politics of Transhumanism|    year = 2001 |   url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nanosocialism" is a term coined by [[David M. Berube]], the associate director of Nanoscience and Technology Studies at the USC NanoCenter, who argues that nanotechnological projections need to be tempered by [[technorealism]] about the [[implications of nanotechnology]] in a [[technocapitalist]] society, but that its [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications]] also offer enormous opportunities for [[abundance (economics)|economic abundance]] and [[social progress]].&lt;ref name="Berube 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
In the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Transhuman Space]]'', nanosocialism is described as a descendant of [[infosocialism]], in which [[intellectual property]] is [[nationalization|nationalized]] and freely distributed by the state. It is adopted by some developing nations to counter the hold corporations from wealthier nations have on [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s. This fictional version of nanosocialism was coined by [[David L. Pulver]], the game's creator, who was unaware that the term had already been used by Berube.

The '''Neolithic Revolution''', '''Neolithic Demographic Transition''', '''Agricultural Revolution''', or '''First Agricultural Revolution''' was the wide-scale transition of many [[human culture]]s during the [[Neolithic]] period from a lifestyle of [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to one of [[agriculture]] and [[sedentism|settlement]], making an increasingly larger population possible.&lt;ref name=SCNDR&gt;{{cite journal|title= When the World's Population Took Off: The Springboard of the Neolithic Demographic Transition|journal= Science|date= July 29, 2011|volume= 333|issue= 6042|pages= 560–561|doi= 10.1126/science.1208880|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/560.full|accessdate= June 10, 2012|author= Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|bibcode = 2011Sci...333..560B|pmid= 21798934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Worlds together, worlds apart concise edition vol.1 |last = Pollard, Rosenberg, and Tigor |publisher = W.W.

Archaeological data indicates that the [[domestication]] of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Holocene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.westfalen-blatt.de/nachricht/2012-11-25-klimaschutz-die-ziele-schmelzen-dahin/613/

The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a downturn in human nutrition.&lt;ref name=Armelagos2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Armelagos|first1= George J.|title= Brain Evolution, the Determinates of Food Choice, and the Omnivore's Dilemma|journal= Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume= 54|issue= 10|year= 2014|pages= 1330–1341|issn= 1040-8398|doi= 10.1080/10408398.2011.635817|pmid= 24564590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated [[human history|human pre-history]] into [[sedentism|sedentary]] (non-[[nomad]]ic) [[society|societies]] based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their [[natural environment]] by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as [[irrigation]] and [[deforestation]] which allowed the production of surplus food.  Other developments found very widely are the [[domestication of animals]],  [[pottery]], polished stone tools, and rectangular houses.

These developments, sometimes called the '''Neolithic package''', provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical [[ideology|ideologies]], depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. [[history of writing|writing]]), [[population density|densely populated]] settlements, specialization and [[division of labour]], more [[trade]], the development of non-portable [[art]] and [[architecture]], and [[property]] ownership.  The earliest known [[civilization]] developed in [[Sumer]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] ({{circa|6,500 [[Before Present|BP]]}}); its emergence also heralded the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.ancient.eu/Neolithic/|title= Neolithic|work= Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date= 2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and varies from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of [[social evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm "The Slow Birth of Agriculture"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101201656/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm |date=2011-01-01 }}, [[Heather Pringle]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |title=Wizard Chemi Shanidar |work=EMuseum |publisher=[[Minnesota State University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618214404/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |archive-date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Levant]] saw the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, followed by sites in the wider [[Fertile Crescent]].

[[File:Knapp of Howar 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Knap of Howar]] farmstead on a site occupied from 3,700 BC to 2,800 BC]]

The term ''Neolithic Revolution'' was coined in 1923 by [[V. Gordon Childe]] to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in [[Middle East]]ern history. The period is described as a "revolution" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.

The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BC in the [[Fertile Crescent]]&lt;ref name=Barker2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thissen2002&gt;Thissen, L. "Appendix I, The CANeW 14C databases, Anatolia 10,000-5000 cal. BC." in: F. Gérard and L. Thissen (eds.), '' The Neolithic of Central Anatolia. Internal developments and external relations during the 9th–6th millennia cal BC'', Proc. Int.  CANeW Round Table, Istanbul 23–24 November 2001, (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps 8000 BC in the [[Kuk Swamp|Kuk Early Agricultural Site]] of [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref name="Denham2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Denham|first = Tim P.|authorlink =|year = 2003|title = Origins of Agriculture at Kuk Swamp in the Highlands of New Guinea|journal = Science|volume = 301|issue = 5630|pages = 189–193|doi = 10.1126/science.1085255| pmid = 12817084 |author3 = and others|displayauthors = 2|last2 = Haberle|first2 = S.

Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kealhofer |first=Lisa |title=Looking into the gap: land use and the tropical forests of southern Thailand |journal=Asian Perspectives |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=1|pages=72–95 |doi=10.1353/asi.2003.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several competing (but not mutually exclusive) theories as to the factors that drove populations to take up agriculture. The most prominent of these are:
* The Oasis Theory, originally proposed by [[Raphael Pumpelly]] in 1908, popularized by [[V. Gordon Childe]] in 1928 and summarised in Childe's book ''Man Makes Himself''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man Makes Himself|author=Gordon Childe|year=1936|publisher=Oxford university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to [[oases]] where they were forced into close association with animals, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. However, today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Chris (2005). "The World Transformed: From Foragers and Farmers to States and Empires" in ''The Human Past: World Prehistory and the Development of Human Societies'' (Ed: Chris Scarre). London: Thames and Hudson. p. 188. {{ISBN|0500285314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hilly Flanks]] hypothesis, proposed by [[Robert Braidwood]] in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] and [[Zagros mountains]], where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed, and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of Civilization: From Early Hunters to Urban Society in the Ancient Near East |author=Charles E. Redman |year=1978 |publisher=Freeman |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Feasting model by Brian Hayden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Brian |chapter=Models of Domestication|title=Transitions to Agriculture in Prehistory |editor=Anne Birgitte Gebauer and T. Douglas Price |location=Madison |publisher=Prehistory Press |year=1992 |pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power, such as giving feasts, to exert dominance. This required assembling large quantities of food, which drove agricultural technology.
* The Demographic theories proposed by [[Carl Sauer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sauer |first=Carl O. |year=1952|title=Agricultural origins and dispersals|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted by [[Lewis Binford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Binford |first=Lewis R. |year=1968 |chapter=Post-Pleistocene Adaptations |title=New Perspectives in Archaeology |editor=Sally R. Binford and Lewis R. Binford |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |location=Chicago |pages=313–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kent Flannery]] posit an increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered. Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food.
* The evolutionary/intentionality theory, developed by [[David Rindos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Agriculture: An Evolutionary Perspective|first=David|last=Rindos|publisher=Academic Press|date=December 1987|isbn=978-0125892810}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, views agriculture as an evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans. Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants, it led to specialization of location and then full-fledged domestication.
* [[Peter Richerson]], [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]], and [[Robert Bettinger]]&lt;ref name="Richersonetal2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Richerson|first = Peter J.|authorlink =|year = 2001|title = Was Agriculture Impossible during the Pleistocene but Mandatory during the Holocene?|journal = American Antiquity|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 387–411|doi = 10.2307/2694241|displayauthors = etal |jstor = 2694241|last2 = Boyd|first2 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; make a case for the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. [[Ronald Wright]]'s book and Massey Lecture Series ''[[A Short History of Progress]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Progress|first=Ronald|last=Wright|publisher=Anansi|year=2004|isbn=978-0887847066}}&lt;/ref&gt; popularized this hypothesis.
* The postulated [[Younger Dryas event|Younger Dryas impact event]], claimed to be in part responsible for [[Quaternary extinction event|megafauna extinction]] and ending the last [[glacial period]], could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David G|author2=Albert C. Goodyear |author3=James Kennett |author4=Allen West |title=Multiple lines of evidence for possible Human population decline/settlement reorganization during the early Younger Dryas|journal=Quaternary International|date=2011|volume=242|issue=2|pages=570–583|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.04.020|bibcode=2011QuInt.242..570A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agrarian revolution itself is a reflection of typical overpopulation by certain species following initial events during extinction eras; this overpopulation itself ultimately propagates the extinction event.
* [[Leonid Grinin]] argues that whatever plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always took place in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East: in the hills of Palestine or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals' bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L.E.

Volume 6, Number 2 / September 2007 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129510/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrew M. T. Moore|Andrew Moore]] suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the [[Levant]], possibly beginning during the [[Epipaleolithic]]. In ''"A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution"'', [[Frank Hole]] further expanded the relationship between plant and [[animal domestication]]. He suggested the events could have occurred independently over different periods of time, in as yet unexplored locations. He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems. He noted that the full range of domesticated animals ([[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]] and [[pigs]]) were not found until the sixth millennium at [[Tell Ramad]]. Hole concluded that ''"close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the [[Euphrates]] basin, perhaps as far south as the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially where [[wadi]]s carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1984_num_10_2_939 Hole, Frank., A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution, Paléorient, Volume 10, Issue 10-2, pp. 49-60, 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once agriculture started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, human activity resulted in the [[selective breeding]] of cereal grasses (beginning with [[emmer]], [[einkorn]] and [[barley]]), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would have been seen as undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.

Several plant species, the "pioneer crops" or [[Neolithic founder crops]], were identified by [[Daniel Zohary]], who highlighted the importance of the three [[cereal]]s, and suggested that domestication of [[flax]], [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]] and [[lentil]]s came a little later. Based on analysis of the [[gene]]s of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each [[taxon]] that spread in an arc from the [[Levantine corridor]] around the [[Fertile Crescent]] and later into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRi1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;dq=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jSDLeRcJNI&amp;sig=V8u7my28ypj_bN_lBNIYmGc_HX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cvUqUIbjFOmf0QXxp4GgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y Zohary, D., The mode of domestication of the founder crops of Southwest Asian agriculture. pp. 142-158 in D.

Selectively propagated [[ficus|figs]], wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of [[Gilgal I]], where in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060602074522.htm|title=Tamed 11,400 Years Ago, Figs Were Likely First Domesticated Crop}}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by [[intensive gathering]], at strata datable to c. 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.

Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation, their crops would [[Crop yield|yield]] surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually [[granary|granaries]] were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.

The process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.

===In the Fertile Crescent===

Early agriculture is believed to have originated and become widespread in Southwest [[Asia]] around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The [[Fertile Crescent]] region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea), and flax. Domestication was a slow process involving multiple sites for each crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Brown | first1=T. A. | last2=Jones | first2=M.

===In Africa===
[[File:Nile-River1.ogv|thumb|right|Nile River Valley, Egypt]]

On the African continent, three areas have been identified as independently developing agriculture: the [[Ethiopian Highlands|Ethiopian highlands]], the [[Sahel]] and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond|first= Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond| year=1999|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|publisher= New York: Norton Press|isbn= 978-0393317558|title-link= Guns, Germs, and Steel}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast,   [[Agriculture in Egypt|Agriculture in the Nile River Valley]] is thought to have developed from the original Neolithic Revolution in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 
Many grinding stones are found with the early Egyptian [[Sebilian]] and [[Mechian]] cultures and evidence has been found of a neolithic domesticated crop-based economy dating around 7,000 BP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JAca1F3qG34C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Africa,+neolithic&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wWVGAvbwDC&amp;sig=oLsfZADAq2fplcionxe5hXjBgXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V8GKSaSbO9eitge6-eibBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 The Cambridge History of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Philip E.L., Stone Age Man on the Nile, Scientific American Vol. 235 No. 2, August 1976: "With the benefit of hindsight we can now see that many Late Paleolithic peoples in the Old World were poised on the brink of plant cultivation and animal husbandry as an alternative to the hunter-gatherer's way of life".&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the Middle East, this evidence appears as a "false dawn" to agriculture, as the sites were later abandoned, and permanent farming then was delayed until 6,500 BP with the [[Tasian]] and [[Badarian]] cultures and the arrival of crops and animals from the Near East.

[[Bananas]] and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], which were first domesticated in [[Southeast Asia]], most likely [[Papua New Guinea]], were re-domesticated in Africa possibly as early as 5,000 years ago. Asian yams and [[taro]] were also cultivated in Africa.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

The most famous crop domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands is [[coffee]]. In addition, [[khat]], [[ensete]], [[noog]], [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include [[sorghum]] and [[pearl millet]]. The [[kola nut]] was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include [[African rice]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and the [[oil palm]].&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

Agriculture spread to Central and Southern Africa in the [[Bantu expansion]] during the 1st millennium BC to 1st millennium AD.

===In the Americas===
{{further|New World Crops|Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Oasisamerica|Proto-Uto-Aztecan}}

[[Maize]] (corn), [[beans]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] were among the earliest crops domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]], with maize beginning about 4000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Johannessen, S. |editor2=Hastorf, C. A. |title=Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World |publisher=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; squash as early as 6000 BC, and beans by no later than 4000 BC. [[Potatoes]] and [[manioc]] were domesticated in [[South America]]. In what is now the eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated [[sunflower]], [[sumpweed]] and [[goosefoot]] around 2500 BC. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.&lt;ref name="Barker2009p252"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Barker|title=The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory: Why Did Foragers Become Farmers?|page=  252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkifXu2gx4YC|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199559954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New Guinea===
Evidence of drainage ditches at [[Kuk Swamp]] on the borders of the [[Western Highlands Province|Western]] and [[Southern Highlands Province|Southern Highlands]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] shows evidence of the cultivation of [[taro]] and a variety of other crops, dating back to 11,000 BP. Two potentially significant economic species, taro (''[[Colocasia esculenta]]'') and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] (''[[Dioscorea]]'' sp.), have been identified dating at least to 10,200 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Further evidence of [[banana]]s and [[sugarcane]] dates to 6,950 to 6,440 BP. This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops, and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier. [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] has found evidence that taro was introduced into the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]] for human use, from 28,000 years ago, making taro cultivation the earliest crop in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Denham, Tim et al. (received July 2005) "Early and mid Holocene tool-use and processing of taro (''Colocasia esculenta''), yam (''Dioscorea'' sp.) and other plants at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New Guinea" (Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 33, Issue 5, May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Thomas &amp; Matthew Springs (1992), " Direct evidence for human use of plants 28,000 years ago: starch residues on stone artefacts from the northern Solomon Islands" (Antiquity  Volume: 66,  Number: 253, pp. 898–912)&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems to have resulted in the spread of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and west into [[Timor]] and adjacent areas of [[Indonesia]]. This seems to confirm the theories of [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] who, in "Agricultural Origins and Dispersals", suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture.

==Domestication of animals==
{{Further|Domestication of animals}}
When hunter-gathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|work=Genographic Project|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en-US|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|archivedate=2016-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs ([[East Asia]], about 15,000 years ago),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Domestication of animals in the Middle East===
[[File:Menare.jpg|Dromedary caravan in Algeria|thumb|right]]

The Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area was also the first region to [[domesticate]] the [[dromedary]]. [[Henri Fleisch]] discovered and termed the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] [[flint]] industry from the [[Bekaa Valley]] in [[Lebanon]] and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s. He dated this industry to the [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] as it is evidently not [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] or even [[Pottery]] [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Préhistoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of [[Afroeurasia]]. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like [[Jared Diamond]], have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of [[Africa]] to reach the Mediterranean climates of [[South Africa]], where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies''. [[Jared Diamond]] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the African [[Zebu]] of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each other's region.

==Consequences==

===Social change===
[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|left|320px|World population (estimated) did not rise for a few millennia after the Neolithic revolution.]]

Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects,
mostly diseases and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Scott]],''Against the Grain: a Deep History of the Earliest States'', NJ:Yale UP, (2017), "The world's population in 10 000 BC, according to a careful estimate was roughly 4 million. A full five thousand years later it has risen only to 5 million...One likely explanation for this apparent human progress in subsistance techniques together with a long period of demographic stagnation is that epidemologically this was perhaps the most lethal period in human history".&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increase in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth.&lt;ref name="SandsMorris2009"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377–389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 |  type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeefeCordain2004"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=O'Keefe JH, Cordain L| title=Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our Paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer. | journal=Mayo Clin Proc | year= 2004 | volume= 79 | issue= 1 | pages= 101–108 | pmid=14708953 | doi=10.4065/79.1.101 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shermer, Michael 2001 p.250"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shermer, Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |year=2001 |title=The Borderlands of Science |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average height went down from 5'10" (178&amp;nbsp;cm) for men and 5'6" (168&amp;nbsp;cm) for women to 5'5" (165&amp;nbsp;cm) and 5'1" (155&amp;nbsp;cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hermanussen | first=Michael | last2=Poustka | first2=Fritz | title=Stature of early Europeans | journal=Hormones (Athens) | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=175–178 |date=July–September 2003 | pmid=17003019 | doi=10.1159/000079404 | url=http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making.&lt;ref name="Eagly99"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eagly, Alice H. |author2=Wood, Wendy |title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behavior: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=June 1999 |pages=408–423 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] (in [[The World Until Yesterday]]) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently.

Spike Peterson]], points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged [[gender inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diamond, Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race  |title=The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race |journal=Discover Magazine |date=May 1987 |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=V.

===Subsequent revolutions===
[[File:Egyptian Domesticated Animals.jpg|thumb|Domesticated cow being milked in [[Ancient Egypt]]]]

[[Andrew Sherratt]] has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the [[secondary products revolution]]. Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"&gt;Sherratt 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:
* [[History of hide materials|hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)]]
* [[manure]] for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)
* [[wool]] (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and [[Angora goat]]s)
* [[milk]] (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses and camels)
* [[Working animal|traction]] (from oxen, [[onagers]], donkeys, horses, camels and dogs)
* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)

Sherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible [[nomadic pastoralism]] in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel]].&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"/&gt; Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.

Living in one spot would have more easily permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once [[trade]] and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] in which the first cities were built.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Disease===

Throughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of [[infectious diseases]] spread from animals to humans are [[influenza]], [[smallpox]], and [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Furuse | first1=Y. | last2=Suzuki | first2=A. | last3=Oshitani | first3=H. | title=Origin of measles virus: Divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-7-52 | journal=Virology Journal | volume=7 | page=52 | year=2010 | pmc=2838858 | pmid=20202190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In concordance with a process of [[natural selection]], the humans who first domesticated the big [[mammals]] quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''.  [[Jared Diamond]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the population of most [[Caribbean]] and several [[Pacific Islands]] have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|wiped out by European and African diseases]] before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the [[Inca Empire]] did have a large domestic mammal, the [[llama]], but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halcrow |first=S. |author2=E., Harris, N.

===Technology===

In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] argues that Europeans and East Asians benefited from an advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution. Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings, both were near a number of easily [[domestication|domesticable]] plant and animal species, and both were safer from attacks of other people than civilizations in the middle part of the Eurasian continent. Being among the first to adopt agriculture and sedentary lifestyles, and neighboring other early agricultural societies with whom they could compete and trade, both Europeans and East Asians were also among the first to benefit from technologies such as [[firearm]]s and steel [[sword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/overview_british_prehistory_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Ancient History in depth: Overview: From Neolithic to Bronze Age, 8000–800 BC|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--During and after the [[Age of Discovery]], European explorers, such as the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, encountered other groups of people who had never or only recently adopted agriculture. (SO WHAT?)--&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The dispersal of Neolithic culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the distribution of human genetic markers. In Europe, the spread of the Neolithic culture has been associated with distribution of the [[E1b1b]] lineages and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]] that are thought to have arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Near East respectively.&lt;ref name="semino2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semino|year=2004|title=Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J: Inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and Later Migratory Events in the Mediterranean Area|pmid=15069642|first1=O|last2=Magri|first2=C|last3=Benuzzi|first3=G|last4=Lin|first4=AA|last5=Al-Zahery|first5=N|last6=Battaglia|first6=V|last7=MacCioni|first7=L|last8=Triantaphyllidis|first8=C|last9=Shen|first9=P|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1023–34|doi=10.1086/386295|pmc=1181965|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=Andrew|year=2009|url=http://www.jogg.info/51/files/Lancaster.pdf|journal=Journal of Genetic Genealogy|volume=5|issue=1|title=Y Haplogroups, Archaeological Cultures and Language Families: a Review of the Multidisciplinary Comparisons using the case of E-M35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, the spread of farming, and notably the [[Bantu expansion]], is associated with the dispersal of Y-chromosome haplogroup [[E1b1a]] from West Africa.&lt;ref name="semino2004"/&gt;

'''Peter Assheton Sturgeon''' (November 22, 1916 &amp;ndash; July 22, 2005) was founder of the American branch of [[Mensa International|Mensa]] and the older brother of noted American science fiction writer [[Theodore Sturgeon]]. 

The two brothers were the sons of Edward Molineaux Waldo, a Staten Island paint manufacturer, and Christine Hamilton Dicker, a British writer and political activist. Their parents divorced when they were children and in 1927 their mother married William Dickie Sturgeon, an emigrant Scottish college professor. Christine and her children relocated to Philadelphia where Peter and his brother Ted were educated in public schools.

After high school Peter joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]].  After working for a time as a party activist in a steel industry organizing campaign in Baltimore, he went to Spain and fought on the Republican side in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as a volunteer with the [[British Battalion]] of the [[International Brigades]]. The writer [[William Tenn]] has stated that Sturgeon became involved with [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] while in Spain and fell into disfavor with his superiors. After returning to the United States Sturgeon resigned from the Communist Party and associated with the Trotskyist [[Socialist Workers Party (United States) | Socialist Workers Party]]. In 1941, he was drafted into the [[U.S. Army|Army]], serving as a combat paratrooper in the [[517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team]] until his discharge in November 1945. After the war he earned a BS degree at [[New York University]]. He settled in Brooklyn with his wife Ines, working as a medical writer and writing technical material for the pharmaceutical industry. He founded the first American chapter of Mensa in New York in 1960, holding early meetings at his Brooklyn apartment. In 1965 he left the United States, taking a job with the [[World Health Organization]] in Switzerland. In 1968 he relocated to Vienna, Austria where he worked for the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]. He died in Vienna in 2005.

[[Artificial intelligence]] has close connections with [[philosophy]] because both share several concepts and these include intelligence, action, [[consciousness]], [[epistemology]], and even [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/aiphil2.html|title=The Philosophy of AI and the AI of Philosophy|last=McCarthy|first=John|website=jmc.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people (or, at least, artificial creatures) so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{Citation|last=Bringsjord|first=Selmer|title=Artificial Intelligence|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/artificial-intelligence/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-09-18|last2=Govindarajulu|first2=Naveen Sundar}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors contributed to the emergence of the '''philosophy of artificial intelligence.''' Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental.

The philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} define the philosophy of AI as consisting of the first two questions, and the additional question of the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]. {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=55}} writes "In the current literature, philosophy has two chief roles: to determine whether or not such machines would be conscious, and, second, to predict whether or not such machines are possible." The last question bears on the first two.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Can a machine act intelligently? Can it solve ''any'' problem that a person would solve by thinking?
* Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same?  Is the [[human brain]] essentially a computer?
* Can a machine have a [[philosophy of mind|mind]], mental states, and [[consciousness]] in the same way that a human being can? Can it ''feel how things are''?
These three questions reflect the divergent interests of [[artificial intelligence|AI researchers]], [[Linguistics|linguists]], [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]]s respectively. The scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of "intelligence" and "consciousness" and exactly which "machines" are under discussion.

Important [[proposition]]s in the philosophy of AI include:

*[[Turing test|Turing's "polite convention"]]: ''If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.''&lt;ref name=T&gt;This is a paraphrase of the essential point of the [[Turing test]]. {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|pp=6–9}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=24}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=2–3 and 948}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dartmouth Workshop#Planning the Summer Research Project: The Proposal |Dartmouth proposal]]: ''"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."''&lt;ref name=MMRS&gt;{{Harvnb|McCarthy|Minsky|Rochester|Shannon|1955}}. This assertion was printed in the program for the [[Dartmouth Conferences|Dartmouth Conference]] of 1956, widely considered the "birth of AI."also {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis: ''"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."''&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Searle|Searle]]'s [[strong AI hypothesis]]: ''"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."''&lt;ref name=SWAI&gt;This version is from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}, and is also quoted in {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=435}}. Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."  {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=1}}.  Strong AI is defined similarly by {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' mechanism: ''"For 'reason' ... is nothing but 'reckoning,' that is adding and subtracting, of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the 'marking' and 'signifying' of our thoughts..."''&lt;ref name=H&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobbes|1651|loc=chpt. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Can a machine display general intelligence?==
Is it possible to create a machine that can solve ''all'' the problems humans solve using their intelligence? This question defines the scope of what machines will be able to do in the future and guides the direction of AI research. It only concerns the ''behavior'' of machines and ignores the issues of interest to [[psychology|psychologists]], cognitive scientists and [[philosophy|philosophers]]; to answer this question, it does not matter whether a machine is ''really'' thinking (as a person thinks) or is just ''acting like'' it is thinking.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=3}}, where they make the distinction between ''acting'' rationally and ''being'' rational, and define AI as the study of the former.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic position of most AI researchers is summed up in this statement, which appeared in the proposal for the [[Dartmouth workshop]] of 1956:
* ''Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.''&lt;ref name=MMRS/&gt;
Arguments against the basic premise must show that building a working AI system is impossible, because there is some practical limit to the abilities of computers or that there is some special quality of the human mind that is necessary for thinking and yet cannot be duplicated by a machine (or by the methods of current AI research).  Arguments in favor of the basic premise must show that such a system is possible.

The first step to answering the question is to clearly define "intelligence".

===Intelligence===
[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The "standard interpretation" of the Turing test.{{sfn|Saygin|2000}}]]

====Turing test====
{{Main|Turing test}}

[[Alan Turing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} and see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=948}}, where they call his paper "famous" and write "Turing examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared."&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the problem of defining intelligence to a simple question about conversation. He suggests that: if a machine can answer ''any'' question put to it, using the same words that an ordinary person would, then we may call that machine intelligent. A modern version of his experimental design would use an online [[chat room]], where one of the participants is a real person and one of the participants is a computer program. The program passes the test if no one can tell which of the two participants is human.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; Turing notes that no one (except philosophers) ever asks the question "can people think?" He writes "instead of arguing continually over this point, it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "The Argument from Consciousness"&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's test extends this polite convention to machines:
* ''If a machine acts as intelligently as human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.''
One criticism of the [[Turing test]] is that it is explicitly [[anthropomorphic]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. If our ultimate goal is to create machines that are ''more'' intelligent than people, why should we insist that our machines must closely ''resemble'' people?{{Cite quote|date=April 2017}} [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] write that "aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as 'making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intelligent agent definition====
[[File:IntelligentAgent-SimpleReflex.png|thumb|left|Simple reflex agent]]
Recent A.I. research defines intelligence in terms of [[intelligent agent]]s. An "agent" is something which perceives and acts in an environment. A "performance measure" defines what counts as success for the agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=4–5, 32, 35, 36 and 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''If an agent acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge then it is intelligent.''&lt;ref&gt;Russell and Norvig would prefer the word "[[rational agent|rational]]" to "intelligent".&lt;/ref&gt;
Definitions like this one try to capture the essence of intelligence. They have the advantage that, unlike the Turing test, they do not also test for human traits that we {{Who|date=April 2017}} may not want to consider intelligent, like the ability to be insulted or the temptation to lie {{Dubious|date=April 2017}}. They have the disadvantage that they fail to make the commonsense{{Definition|date=April 2017}} differentiation between "things that think" and "things that do not". By this definition, even a thermostat has a rudimentary intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=48–52}} consider a thermostat a simple form of [[intelligent agent]], known as a [[Intelligent agent#Classes of intelligent agents|reflex agent]]. For an in-depth treatment of the role of the thermostat in philosophy see {{harvtxt|Chalmers|1996|pp=293–301}} "4. Is Experience Ubiquitous?" subsections ''What is it like to be a thermostat?'', ''Whither panpsychism?'', and ''Constraining the double-aspect principle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments that a machine can display general intelligence===

====The brain can be simulated====
{{Main|Artificial brain}}

[[File:MRI.ogg|thumbtime=2|thumb|240px|An [[MRI]] scan of a normal adult human brain]]
[[Hubert Dreyfus]] describes this argument as claiming that "if the nervous system obeys the laws of physics and chemistry, which we have every reason to suppose it does, then .... we ... ought to be able to reproduce the behavior of the nervous system with some physical device".&lt;ref name="Dreyfus 1972 p=106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument, first introduced as early as 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pitts|McCullough|1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vividly described by [[Hans Moravec]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now associated with futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]], who estimates that computer power will be sufficient for a complete brain simulation by the year 2029.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=262}}. Also see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|p=957}} and {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=271 and 279}}. The most extreme form of this argument (the brain replacement scenario) was put forward by [[Clark Glymour]] in the mid-1970s and was touched on by [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] and John Searle in 1980&lt;/ref&gt; A non-real-time simulation of a thalamocortical model that has the size of the human brain (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) was performed in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eugene Izhikevich |url=http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm |title=Eugene M. Izhikevich, Large-Scale Simulation of the Human Brain |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501041325/http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it took 50 days to simulate 1 second of brain dynamics on a cluster of 27 processors.

Few{{Quantify|date=April 2017}} disagree that a brain simulation is possible in theory,{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} even critics of AI such as Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus writes: "In general, by accepting the fundamental assumptions that the nervous system is part of the physical world and that all physical processes can be described in a mathematical formalism which can, in turn, be manipulated by a digital computer, one can arrive at the strong claim that the behavior which results from human 'information processing,' whether directly formalizable or not, can always be indirectly reproduced on a digital machine." {{Harv|Dreyfus|1972|pp=194–5}}. [[John Searle]] writes: "Could a man made machine think? Assuming it possible produce artificially a machine with a nervous system, ... the answer to the question seems to be obviously, yes ... Could a digital computer think? If by 'digital computer' you mean anything at all that has a level of description where it can be correctly described as the instantiation of a computer program, then again the answer is, of course, yes, since we are the instantiations of any number of computer programs, and we can think." {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Searle points out that, in principle, ''anything'' can be simulated by a computer; thus, bringing the definition to its breaking point leads to the conclusion that any process at all can technically be considered "computation". "What we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers," he writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, merely mimicking the functioning of a brain would in itself be an admission of ignorance regarding intelligence and the nature of the mind {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.
&lt;!--ARENT THERE SOME MORE DIRECT REFUTATIONS OF KURZWEIL?? --&gt;

====Human thinking is symbol processing====
{{Main|Physical symbol system}}

In 1963, [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] proposed that "symbol manipulation" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence. They wrote: 
* ''A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.''&lt;ref name=NS/&gt;
This claim is very strong: it implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is ''necessary'' for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is ''sufficient'' for intelligence).&lt;ref&gt;Searle writes "I like the straight forwardness of the claim." {{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of this position was described by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who called it "the psychological assumption":
* ''The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A distinction is usually made {{By whom|date=April 2017}} between the kind of high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tail&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the more complex "symbols" that are present in a machine like a [[neural network]]. Early research into AI, called "good old fashioned artificial intelligence" ([[GOFAI]]) by [[John Haugeland]], focused on these kind&lt;!--change to "kinds" or "types"?--&gt; of high level symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against symbol processing====
These arguments show that human thinking does not consist (solely) of high level symbol manipulation. They do ''not'' show that artificial intelligence is impossible, only that more than symbol processing is required.

=====Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments=====
{{Main article|Mechanism (philosophy)#G.C3.B6delian arguments|l1=Mechanism (philosophy): Gödelian arguments}}
In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved with an [[incompleteness theorem]] that it is always possible to construct a "Gödel [[statement (logic)|statement]]" that a given consistent [[formal system]] of logic (such as a high-level symbol manipulation program) could not prove. Despite being a true statement, the constructed Gödel statement is unprovable in the given system. (The truth of the constructed Gödel statement is contingent on the consistency of the given system; applying the same process to a subtly inconsistent system will appear to succeed, but will actually yield a false "Gödel statement" instead.){{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} More speculatively, Gödel conjectured that the human mind can correctly eventually determine the truth or falsity of any well-grounded mathematical statement (including any possible Gödel statement), and that therefore the human mind's power is not reducible to a ''[[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23. - In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] (since 1961) and [[Roger Penrose]] (since 1989) have championed this philosophical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref name=L&gt;{{Harvnb|Lucas|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=949–950}}, {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=471–473,476–477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments tend to rely on the innocuous-seeming claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent (completely free of error) and believes fully in its own consistency (and can make all logical inferences that follow from its own consistency, including belief in its Gödel statement) {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. This is provably impossible for a Turing machine {{Clarify|date=April 2017}} (and, by an informal extension, any known type of mechanical computer) to do; therefore, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning is too powerful to be captured in a machine {{Dubious|date=April 2017}}.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument that humans have mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond what a machine could ever duplicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

More pragmatically, Russell and Norvig note that Gödel's argument only applies to what can theoretically be proved, given an infinite amount of memory and time. In practice, real machines (including humans) have finite resources and will have difficulty proving many theorems. It is not necessary to prove everything in order to be intelligent {{Definition|date=April 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950}}  They point out that real machines with finite memory can be modeled using [[propositional logic]], which is formally [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], and Gödel's argument does not apply to them at all.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less formally, [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his [[Pulitzer prize]] winning book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]],'' states that these "Gödel-statements" always refer to the system itself, drawing an analogy to the way the [[Epimenides paradox]] uses statements that refer to themselves, such as "this statement is false" or "I am lying".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, of course, the [[Epimenides paradox]] applies to anything that makes statements, whether they are machines ''or'' humans, even Lucas himself. Consider:
* ''Lucas can't assert the truth of this statement.''&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=476–477}}, this statement was first proposed by [[C. H. Whiteley]]&lt;/ref&gt;
This statement is true but cannot be asserted by Lucas. This shows that Lucas himself is subject to the same limits that he describes for machines, as are all people, and so [[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas]]'s argument is pointless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=476–477}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950}}, {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "The Argument from Mathematics" where he writes "although it is established that there are limitations to the powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect."&lt;/ref&gt;

After concluding that human reasoning is non-computable, Penrose went on to controversially speculate that some kind of hypothetical non-computable processes involving the collapse of [[quantum mechanical]] states give humans a special advantage over existing computers. Existing quantum computers are only capable of reducing the complexity of Turing computable tasks and are still restricted to tasks within the scope of Turing machines. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} {{Clarify|date=April 2017}}. By Penrose and Lucas's arguments, existing quantum computers are not sufficient {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}{{Why|date=April 2017}}, so Penrose seeks for some other process involving new physics, for instance quantum gravity which might manifest new physics at the scale of the [[Planck mass]] via spontaneous quantum collapse of the wave function. These states, he suggested, occur both within neurons and also spanning more than one neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scientists point out that there is no plausible organic mechanism in the brain for harnessing any sort of quantum computation, and furthermore that the timescale of quantum decoherence seems too fast to influence neuron firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Litt|first1=Abninder|last2=Eliasmith|first2=Chris|last3=Kroon|first3=Frederick W.|last4=Weinstein|first4=Steven|last5=Thagard|first5=Paul|title=Is the Brain a Quantum Computer?|journal=Cognitive Science|date=6 May 2006|volume=30|issue=3|pages=593–603|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0000_59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dreyfus: the primacy of implicit skills=====
{{Main|Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence}}

Hubert Dreyfus [[argued that human intelligence|Hubert Dreyfus's views on artificial intelligence]] and expertise depended primarily on implicit skill  rather than explicit symbolic manipulation, and argued that these skills would never be captured in formal rules.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}. See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950–952}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|120-132}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]]'s argument had been anticipated by Turing in his 1950 paper [[Computing machinery and intelligence]], where he had classified this as the "argument from the informality of behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing argued in response that, just because we do not know the rules that govern a complex behavior, this does not mean that no such rules exist. He wrote: "we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(8) The Argument from the Informality of Behavior"&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] point out that, in the years since Dreyfus published his critique, progress has been made towards discovering the "rules" that govern unconscious reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[situated]] movement in [[robotics]] research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Brooks|1990}} and {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computational intelligence]] paradigms, such as [[neural net]]s, [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning and learning. [[Artificial intelligence#Statistical|Statistical approaches to AI]] can make predictions which approach the accuracy of human intuitive guesses. Research into [[commonsense knowledge]] has focused on reproducing the "background" or context of knowledge. In fact, AI research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation or "[[GOFAI]]", towards new models that are intended to capture more of our ''unconscious'' reasoning {{According to whom|date=April 2017}}. Historian and AI researcher [[Daniel Crevier]] wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."&lt;ref name="Crevier 1993 p=125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a philosophical question, related to the [[problem of other minds]] and the [[hard problem of consciousness]]. The question revolves around a position defined by [[John Searle]] as "strong AI":
* ''A physical symbol system can have a mind and mental states.''&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;
Searle distinguished this position from what he called "weak AI":
* ''A physical symbol system can act intelligently.''&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;
Searle introduced the terms to isolate strong AI from weak AI so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue. He argued that ''even if we assume'' that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind, there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered.&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;

Neither of Searle's two positions are of great concern to AI research, since they do not directly answer the question "can a machine display general intelligence?" (unless it can also be shown that consciousness is ''necessary'' for intelligence). Turing wrote "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness… [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think]."&lt;ref name=T4&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(4) The Argument from Consciousness". See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|pp=952–3}}, where they identify Searle's argument with Turing's "Argument from Consciousness."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and Norvig agree: "Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence, such as [[Igor Aleksander]], [[Stan Franklin]], [[Ron Sun]], and [[Artificial consciousness#Haikonen's cognitive architecture|Pentti Haikonen]], although their definition of "consciousness" strays very close to "intelligence." (See [[artificial consciousness]].)

Before we can answer this question, we must be clear what we mean by "minds", "mental states" and "consciousness".

===Consciousness, minds, mental states, meaning===

The words "[[mind]]" and "[[consciousness]]" are used by different communities in different ways. Some [[new age]] thinkers, for example, use the word "consciousness" to describe something similar to [[Bergson]]'s "[[élan vital]]": an invisible, energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind. [[Science fiction]] writers use the word to describe some [[essentialism|essential]] property that makes us human: a machine or alien that is "conscious" will be presented as a fully human character, with intelligence, desires, will, insight, pride and so on. (Science fiction writers also use the words "sentience", "sapience," "self-awareness" or "ghost" - as in the ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' manga and anime series - to describe this essential human property). For others {{Who|date=April 2017}}, the words "mind" or "consciousness" are used as a kind of secular synonym for the [[soul]].

For [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane: they refer to the familiar, everyday experience of having a "thought in your head", like a perception, a dream, an intention or a plan, and to the way we ''know'' something, or ''mean'' something or ''understand'' something {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. "It's not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness" observes philosopher John Searle.&lt;ref&gt;"[P]eople always tell me it was very hard to define consciousness, but I think if you're just looking for the kind of commonsense definition that you get at the beginning of the investigation, and not at the hard nosed scientific definition that comes at the end, it's not hard to give commonsense definition of consciousness." [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1639491.htm The Philosopher's Zone: The question of consciousness]. Also see {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is mysterious and fascinating is not so much ''what'' it is but ''how'' it is: how does a lump of fatty tissue and electricity give rise to this (familiar) experience of perceiving, meaning or thinking?

[[Philosopher]]s call this the [[hard problem of consciousness]]. It is the latest version of a classic problem in the [[philosophy of mind]] called the "[[mind-body problem]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackmore|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related problem is the problem of ''meaning'' or ''understanding'' (which philosophers call "[[intentionality]]"): what is the connection between our ''thoughts'' and ''what we are thinking about'' (i.e. objects and situations out in the world)? A third issue is the problem of ''experience'' (or "[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]"): If two people see the same thing, do they have the same experience? Or are there things "inside their head" (called "[[qualia]]") that can be different from person to person?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=954–956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neurobiologist]]s believe all these problems will be solved as we begin to identify the [[neural correlates of consciousness]]: the actual relationship between the machinery in our heads and its collective properties; such as the mind, experience and understanding. Some of the harshest critics of [[artificial intelligence]] agree that the brain is just a machine, and that consciousness and intelligence are the result of physical processes in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;For example, John Searle writes: "Can a machine think? The answer is, obvious, yes. We are precisely such machines." {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficult philosophical question is this: can a computer program, running on a digital machine that shuffles the binary digits of zero and one, duplicate the ability of the [[neural correlates of consciousness|neurons]] to create minds, with mental states (like understanding or perceiving), and ultimately, the experience of [[consciousness]]?

===Arguments that a computer cannot have a mind and mental states===

====Searle's Chinese room====
{{Main|Chinese room}}
[[John Searle]] asks us to consider a [[thought experiment]]: suppose we have written a computer program that passes the Turing test and demonstrates "general intelligent action." Suppose, specifically that the program can converse in fluent Chinese. Write the program on 3x5 cards and give them to an ordinary person who does not speak Chinese. Lock the person into a room and have him follow the instructions on the cards. He will copy out Chinese characters and pass them in and out of the room through a slot. From the outside, it will appear that the Chinese room contains a fully intelligent person who speaks Chinese. The question is this: is there anyone (or anything) in the room that understands Chinese? That is, is there anything that has the mental state of [[understanding]], or which has [[consciousness|conscious]] [[awareness]] of what is being discussed in Chinese? The man is clearly not aware. The room cannot be aware. The ''cards'' certainly aren't aware. Searle concludes that the [[Chinese room]], or ''any'' other physical symbol system, cannot have a mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}. See also {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=958–960}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269–272}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=43–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle goes on to argue that actual mental states and [[consciousness]] require (yet to be described) "actual physical-chemical properties of actual human brains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues there are special "causal properties" of [[brain]]s and [[neuron]]s that gives rise to [[mind]]s: in his words "brains cause minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Related arguments: Leibniz' mill, Davis's telephone exchange, Block's Chinese nation and Blockhead====

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] made essentially the same argument as Searle in 1714, using the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a [[mill (factory)|mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.1}}, {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1714|loc=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Lawrence Davis]] imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 [[Ned Block]] envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called "the Chinese Nation" or "the Chinese Gym".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ned Block also proposed his [[Blockhead argument]], which is a version of the [[Chinese room]] in which the program has been [[code refactoring|re-factored]] into a simple set of rules of the form "see this, do that", removing all mystery from the program.

==== Responses to the Chinese room ====

Responses to the Chinese room emphasize several different points. 
* '''The systems reply''' and the '''virtual mind reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "1. The Systems Reply (Berkeley)", {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=269}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=959}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.1}}. Among those who hold to the "system" position (according to Cole) are Ned Block, [[Jack Copeland]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Georges Rey]]. Those who have defended the "virtual mind" reply include [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Alan Perlis]], [[David Chalmers]], Ned Block and J. Cole (again, according to {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}})&lt;/ref&gt; This reply argues that ''the system'', including the man, the program, the room, and the cards, is what understands Chinese. Searle claims that the man in the room is the only thing which could possibly "have a mind" or "understand", but others disagree, arguing that it is possible for there to be ''two'' minds in the same physical place, similar to the way a computer can simultaneously "be" two machines at once: one physical (like a [[Macintosh]]) and one "[[virtual machine|virtual]]" (like a [[word processor]]).
*'''Speed, power and complexity replies''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.2}} ascribes this position to [[Ned Block]], Daniel Dennett, [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and others.&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require "filing cabinets" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.
*'''Robot reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "2. The Robot Reply (Yale)". {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.3}} ascribes this position to [[Margaret Boden]], [[Tim Crane]], Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, [[Stevan Harnad]], Hans Moravec and [[Georges Rey]]&lt;/ref&gt; To truly understand, some believe the Chinese Room needs eyes and hands. Hans Moravec writes: 'If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Brain simulator reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "3. The Brain Simulator Reply (Berkeley and M.I.T.)" {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}} ascribes this position to [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]]&lt;/ref&gt; What if the program simulates the sequence of nerve firings at the synapses of an actual brain of an actual Chinese speaker? The man in the room would be simulating an actual brain. This is a variation on the "systems reply" that appears more plausible because "the system" now clearly operates like a human brain, which strengthens the intuition that there is something besides the man in the room that could understand Chinese.
*'''Other minds reply''' and the '''epiphenomena reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "5. The Other Minds Reply", {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.4}}. {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} makes this reply under "(4) The Argument from Consciousness." Cole ascribes this position to Daniel Dennett and Hans Moravec.&lt;/ref&gt; Several people have noted that Searle's argument is just a version of the [[problem of other minds]], applied to machines. Since it is difficult to decide if people are "actually" thinking, we should not be surprised that it is difficult to answer the same question about machines.

:A related question is whether "consciousness" (as Searle understands it) exists. Searle argues that the experience of consciousness can't be detected by examining the behavior of a machine, a human being or any other animal. [[Daniel Dennett]] points out that natural selection cannot preserve a feature of an animal that has no effect on the behavior of the animal, and thus consciousness (as Searle understands it) can't be produced by natural selection. Therefore either natural selection did not produce consciousness, or "strong AI" is correct in that consciousness can be detected by suitably designed Turing test.

==Is thinking a kind of computation?==
{{Main|computational theory of mind}}

The [[computational theory of mind]] or "[[computationalism]]" claims that the relationship between mind and brain is similar (if not identical) to the relationship between a ''running program'' and a computer. The idea has philosophical roots in [[Hobbes]] (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas), [[David Hume|Hume]] (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|pp=15–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version is associated with philosophers [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horst|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This question bears on our earlier questions: if the human brain is a kind of computer then computers can be both intelligent and conscious, answering both the practical and philosophical questions of AI. In terms of the practical question of AI ("Can a machine display general intelligence?"), some versions of computationalism make the claim that (as [[Hobbes]] wrote):
* ''Reasoning is nothing but reckoning''&lt;ref name=H/&gt;
In other words, our intelligence derives from a form of ''calculation'', similar to [[arithmetic]]. This is the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis discussed above, and it implies that artificial intelligence is possible. In terms of the philosophical question of AI ("Can a machine have mind, mental states and consciousness?"), most versions of [[computationalism]] claim that (as [[Stevan Harnad]] characterizes it):
* ''Mental states are just implementations of (the right) computer programs''&lt;ref name=HARNAD&gt;{{Harvnb|Harnad|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is John Searle's "strong AI" discussed above, and it is the real target of the [[Chinese room]] argument (according to [[Stevan Harnad|Harnad]]).&lt;ref name=HARNAD/&gt;

==Other related questions==

Alan Turing noted that there are many arguments of the form "a machine will never do X", where X can be many things, such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humor, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.&lt;ref name=T5&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(5) Arguments from Various Disabilities"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Turing argues that these objections are often based on naive assumptions about the versatility of machines or are "disguised forms of the argument from consciousness". Writing a program that exhibits one of these behaviors "will not make much of an impression."&lt;ref name=T5/&gt; All of these arguments are tangential to the basic premise of AI, unless it can be shown that one of these traits is essential for general intelligence.

===Can a machine have emotions?===

If "emotions" are defined only in terms of their effect on [[behaviorism|behavior]] or on how they [[function (biology)|function]] inside an organism, then emotions can be viewed as a mechanism that an [[intelligent agent]] uses to maximize the [[utility (economics)|utility]] of its actions. Given this definition of emotion, [[Hans Moravec]] believes that "robots in general will be quite emotional about being nice people".&lt;ref name=CQ266&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear is a source of urgency. Empathy is a necessary component of good [[human computer interaction]]. He says robots "will try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement. You can interpret this as a kind of love."&lt;ref name=CQ266/&gt; [[Daniel Crevier]] writes "Moravec's point is that emotions are just devices for channeling behavior in a direction beneficial to the survival of one's species."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, emotions can also be defined in terms of their [[Subjectivity|subjective]] quality, of what it ''feels like'' to have an emotion. The question of whether the machine ''actually feels'' an emotion, or whether it merely ''acts as if'' it is feeling an emotion is the philosophical question, "can a machine be conscious?" in another form.&lt;ref name=T4/&gt;

===Can a machine be self-aware?===

"Self awareness", as noted above, is sometimes used by [[science fiction]] writers as a name for the [[essentialism|essential]] human property that makes a character fully human. [[Alan Turing|Turing]] strips away all other properties of human beings and reduces the question to "can a machine be the subject of its own thought?" Can it ''think about itself''? Viewed in this way, a program can be written that can report on its own internal states, such as a [[debugger]].&lt;ref name=T5/&gt;  Though arguably self-awareness often presumes a bit more capability; a machine that can ascribe meaning in some way to not only its own state but in general postulating questions without solid answers: the contextual nature of its existence now; how it compares to past states or plans for the future, the limits and value of its work product, how it perceives its performance to be valued-by or compared to others.

===Can a machine be original or creative?===

Turing reduces this to the question of whether a machine can "take us by surprise" and argues that this is obviously true, as any programmer can attest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(6) Lady Lovelace's Objection"&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(5) Argument from Various Disabilities"&lt;/ref&gt; It must be possible, even trivial, for a computer that can represent ideas to combine them in new ways. ([[Douglas Lenat]]'s [[Automated Mathematician]], as one example, combined ideas to discover new mathematical truths.) [[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein suggest that machines can display scientific creativity, while it seems likely that humans will have the upper hand where artistic creativity is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas; Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land? On the Interpretations, Illustrations and Implications of Artificial Intelligence, Business Horizons, 62(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Leslie |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10211175-1.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0 |title=Robo-scientist makes gene discovery-on its own &amp;#124; Crave - CNET |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, researchers at [[Cornell]] developed [[Eureqa]], a computer program that extrapolates formulas to fit the data inputted, such as finding the laws of motion from a pendulum's motion.

===Can a machine be benevolent or hostile?===
{{Main|ethics of artificial intelligence}}

This question (like many others in the philosophy of artificial intelligence) can be presented in two forms. "Hostility" can be defined in terms [[functionalism (philosophy)|function]] or [[behaviorism|behavior]], in which case "hostile" becomes synonymous with "dangerous". Or it can be defined in terms of intent: can a machine "deliberately" set out to do harm? The latter is the question "can a machine have conscious states?" (such as [[intention]]s) in another form.&lt;ref name=T4/&gt;

The question of whether highly intelligent and completely autonomous machines would be dangerous has been examined in detail by futurists (such as the [[Singularity Institute]]). (The obvious element of drama has also made the subject popular in [[science fiction]], which has considered many differently possible scenarios where intelligent machines pose a threat to mankind.)

One issue is that machines may acquire the autonomy and intelligence required to be dangerous very quickly. [[Vernor Vinge]] has suggested that over just a few years, computers will suddenly become thousands or millions of times more intelligent than humans. He calls this "[[Technological singularity|the Singularity]]."&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"/&gt;  He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070101133646/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era], by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge.&lt;/ref&gt; This is discussed by a philosophy called [[Singularitarianism]].

In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm Call for debate on killer robots], By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm Science New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going "Terminator"], by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/navy-report-warns-of-robot-uprising-suggests-a-strong-moral-com/ Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass], by Joseph L. Flatley  engadget.com, Feb 18th 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] has commissioned a study to look at this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008-2009 Study], Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09.&lt;/ref&gt; They point to programs like the [[Language Acquisition Device (computer)|Language Acquisition Device]] which can emulate human interaction.

Some have suggested a need to build "[[Friendly AI]]", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovlaws.com/articles/archives/2004/07/why_we_need_fri_1.html Article at Asimovlaws.com], July 2004, accessed 7/27/09. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630002221/http://www.asimovlaws.com/articles/archives/2004/07/why_we_need_fri_1.html |date=June 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Can a machine have a soul?===

Finally, those who believe in the existence of a soul may argue that "Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul." Alan Turing called this "the theological objection". He writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;In attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(1) The Theological Objection", although it should be noted that he also writes "I am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views on the role of philosophy==
Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental. In the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', some philosophers argue that  the role of philosophy in AI is underappreciated.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Physicist [[David Deutsch]] argues that without an understanding of philosophy or its concepts, AI development would suffer from a lack of progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/03/philosophy-artificial-intelligence|title=Philosophy will be the key that unlocks artificial intelligence {{!}} David Deutsch|last=Deutsch|first=David|date=2012-10-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postmodern philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that arose in the second half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as a critical response to assumptions allegedly present in [[modern philosophy|modernist philosophical ideas]] regarding culture, identity, history, or language that were developed during the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duignan|first1=Brian|title=postmodernism (philosophy) (Encyclopædia Britannica)|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postmodern|title=Definition of POSTMODERN|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Postmodernist thinkers developed concepts like [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]], repetition, [[Trace (deconstruction)|trace]], and [[hyperreality]] to subvert "[[grand narratives]]," [[univocity of being]], and epistemic certainty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/postmodernism/|chapter=Postmodernism|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Aylesworth|first=Gary|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern philosophy questions the importance of power relationships, personalization, and [[discourse]] in the "construction" of truth and world views. Many postmodernists appear to deny that an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] reality exists, and appear to deny that there are objective moral values.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined philosophical postmodernism in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'', writing "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge|last=Lyotard|first=J.-F.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where what he means by [[metanarrative]] is something like a unified, complete, universal, and epistemically certain story about everything that is. Postmodernists reject metanarratives because they reject the concept of truth that metanarratives presuppose. Postmodernist philosophers in general argue that truth is always contingent on historical and social context rather than being absolute and universal and that truth is always partial and "at issue" rather than being complete and certain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Postmodern philosophy is often particularly skeptical about simple binary oppositions characteristic of [[structuralism]], emphasizing the problem of the philosopher cleanly distinguishing knowledge from ignorance, social progress from reversion, dominance from submission, good from bad, and presence from absence.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Stuart. ''Routledge Companion to Postmodernism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Victor and Charles Winquist. ''Encyclopedia of Postmodernism'' "Binary Opposition"&lt;/ref&gt; But, for the same reasons, postmodern philosophy should often be particularly skeptical about the complex spectral characteristics of things, emphasizing the problem of the philosopher again cleanly distinguishing concepts, for a concept must be understood in the context of its opposite, such as existence and nothingness, normality and abnormality, speech and writing, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques; Bass, Alan (2001). "7 :Freud and the Scene of Writing". Writing and Difference (New ed.). London: Routledge. p. 276. {{ISBN|0203991788}}. Retrieved 8 September 2017. The model of hieroglyphic writing assembles more strikingly—though we find it in every form of writing—the diversity of the modes and functions of signs in dreams. Every sign—verbal or otherwise—may be used at different levels, in configurations and functions which are never prescribed by its "essence," but emerge from a play of differences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern philosophy also has strong relations with the substantial literature of [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society. Vol. 23 (2-3). Sage, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristic claims ==
Many postmodern claims are a deliberate repudiation of certain 18th-century Enlightenment values. Such a postmodernist believes that there is no objective natural reality, and that logic and reason are mere conceptual constructs that are not universally valid. Two other characteristic postmodern practices are a denial that [[human nature]] exists, and a (sometimes moderate) skepticism toward claims that science and technology will change society for the better. Postmodernists also believe there are no objective moral values. Thus, postmodern philosophy suggests equality for all things. One's concept of good and another's concept of evil are to be equally correct, since good and evil are subjective. Since both good and evil are equally correct, a postmodernist then [[tolerate]]s both concepts, even if he or she disagrees with them subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, Maria and Carter, J. Adam, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/relativism/ Relativism]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Simon|title=[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|entry=Postmodernism|isbn=9780198610137|language=en|quote=In its poststructuralist aspects it includes a denial of... any fixed reality or truth or fact to be the object of enquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern writings often focus on [[deconstruction|deconstructing]] the role that power and ideology play in shaping discourse and belief. Postmodern philosophy shares [[ontology|ontological]] similarities with classical [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical]] and [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] belief systems, and shares political similarities with modern [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;

The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' states that "The assumption that there is no common denominator in 'nature' or 'truth' ... that guarantees the possibility of neutral or objective thought" is a key assumption of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Ermarth, Elizabeth Deeds. Postmodernism, 1998, doi:10.4324/9780415249126-N044-1. Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Taylor and Francis, https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/postmodernism/v-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] has characterized the belief that "social science research can never generate objective or trustworthy knowledge" as an example of a postmodernist belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council|first1=National Research|last2=Education|first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last3=Education|first3=Center for|last4=Research|first4=Committee on Scientific Principles for Education|title=Scientific Research in Education|date=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=9780309082914|pages=20, 25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s seminal 1979 ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' stated that its hypotheses "should not be accorded predictive value in relation to reality, but strategic value in relation to the questions raised". Lyotard's statement in 1984 that "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives" extends to incredulity toward science. [[Jacques Derrida]], who is generally identified as a postmodernist, stated that "every referent, all reality has the structure of a differential trace".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; [[Paul Feyerabend]], one of the most famous twentieth-century philosophers of science, is often classified as a postmodernist; Feyerabend held that modern science is no more justified than witchcraft, and has denounced the "tyranny" of "abstract concepts such as 'truth', 'reality', or 'objectivity', which narrow people's vision and ways of being in the world".&lt;ref name="sep feyerabend"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preston|first1=John|title=Paul Feyerabend|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/feyerabend/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 April 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Denis Charles|last2=Burbules|first2=Nicholas C.|title=Postpositivism and Educational Research|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847691227|page=1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidd|first1=Ian James|title=Was Feyerabend a Postmodernist?|journal=International Studies in the Philosophy of Science|date=21 December 2016|volume=30|issue=1|pages=55–68|doi=10.1080/02698595.2016.1240463|quote=This article asks whether the philosophy of Paul K. Feyerabend can be reasonably classified as postmodernist, a label applied to him by friends and foes alike.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend also defended astrology, adopted alternative medicine, and sympathized with creationism. Defenders of postmodernism state that many descriptions of postmodernism exaggerate its antipathy to science; for example, Feyerabend denied that he was "anti-science", accepted that some scientific ''theories'' are superior to other theories (even if science itself isn't superior to other modes of inquiry), and attempted conventional medical treatments during his fight against cancer.&lt;ref name="sep feyerabend"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horgan|first1=John|authorlink1=John Horgan|title=Was Philosopher Paul Feyerabend Really Science's "Worst Enemy"?|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/was-philosopher-paul-feyerabend-really-science-s-worst-enemy/|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=[[Scientific American]] Cross-check (blog)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierre|first1=Elizabeth Adams St|title=Comment: “Science” Rejects Postmodernism|journal=Educational Researcher|date=July 2016|volume=31|issue=8|pages=25–27|doi=10.3102/0013189X031008025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitional issues ==
Philosopher [[John Deely]] has argued for the contentious claim that the label "postmodern" for thinkers such as [[Derrida]] ''et al.'' is ''premature''.  Insofar as the "so-called" postmoderns follow the thoroughly ''modern'' trend of [[idealism]], it is more an ''ultra''modernism than anything else. A postmodernism that lives up to its name, therefore, must no longer confine itself to the premodern preoccupation with "things" nor with the modern confinement to "ideas," but must come to terms with the way of signs embodied in the semiotic doctrines of such thinkers as the Portuguese philosopher [[John Poinsot]] and the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;John Deely, ''Four Ages of Understanding: The First Postmodern Survey of Philosophy from Ancient Times to the Turn of the Twenty-First Century'' (Toronto: U. of Toronto, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Writes Deely,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The epoch of Greek and Latin philosophy was based on ''being'' in a quite precise sense: the existence exercised by things independently of human apprehension and attitude. The much briefer epoch of modern philosophy based itself rather on the instruments of human knowing, but in a way that unnecessarily compromised being. As the 20th century ends, there is reason to believe that a new philosophical epoch is dawning along with the new century, promising to be the richest epoch yet for human understanding. The postmodern era is positioned to synthesize at a higher level—the level of experience, where the being of things and the activity of the finite knower compenetrate one another and provide the materials whence can be derived knowledge of nature and knowledge of culture in their full symbiosis—the achievements of the ancients and the moderns in a way that gives full credit to the preoccupations of the two. The postmodern era has for its distinctive task in philosophy the exploration of a new path, no longer the ancient way of things nor the modern way of ideas, but the way of signs, whereby the peaks and valleys of ancient and modern thought alike can be surveyed and cultivated by a generation which has yet further peaks to climb and valleys to find.&lt;ref&gt;John Deely, "Philosophy and Experience," ''American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly'' LXVI.4 (Winter 1992), 299–319, esp. 314–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
===Precursors===
Postmodern philosophy originated primarily in France during the mid-20th century. However, several philosophical antecedents inform many of postmodern philosophy's concerns.

It was greatly influenced by the writings of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in the 19th century and other early-to-mid 20th-century philosophers, including [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[Roland Barthes]], [[Georges Bataille]], and the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Postmodern philosophy also drew from the world of the arts and architecture, particularly [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[John Cage]] and artists who practiced [[collage]], and the architecture of [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] and the [[Pompidou Centre]].

===Early postmodern philosophers===
The most influential early postmodern philosophers were [[Jean Baudrillard]],  [[Jean-François Lyotard]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].  [[Michel Foucault]] is also often cited as an early postmodernist although he personally rejected that label. Following Nietzsche, Foucault argued that knowledge is produced through the operations of ''power'', and changes fundamentally in different historical periods.

The writings of Lyotard were largely concerned with the role of narrative in human culture, and particularly how that role has changed as we have left modernity and entered a "postindustrial" or [[postmodernity|postmodern condition]].  He argued that modern philosophies legitimized their truth-claims not (as they themselves claimed) on logical or empirical grounds, but rather on the grounds of accepted stories (or "[[metanarratives]]") about knowledge and the world—comparing these with Wittgenstein's concept of [[language-game]]s.  He further argued that in our postmodern condition, these metanarratives no longer work to legitimize truth-claims.  He suggested that in the wake of the collapse of modern metanarratives, people are developing a new "language-game"—one that does not make claims to absolute truth but rather celebrates a world of ever-changing relationships (among people and between people and the world).

Derrida, the father of [[deconstruction]], practiced philosophy as a form of textual criticism.  He criticized Western philosophy as privileging the concept of presence and ''logos'', as opposed to absence and markings or writings.

In the United States, the most famous pragmatist and self-proclaimed postmodernist was [[Richard Rorty]].  An analytic philosopher, Rorty believed that combining [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction with [[Wilfrid Sellars]]'s critique of the "[[Myth of the Given]]" allowed for an abandonment of the view of the thought or language as a mirror of a reality or external world.  Further, drawing upon [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s criticism of the dualism between conceptual scheme and empirical content, he challenges the sense of questioning whether our particular concepts are related to the world in an appropriate way, whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways.  He argued that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of a social practice and language was what served our purposes in a particular time; ancient languages are sometimes untranslatable into modern ones because they possess a different vocabulary and are unuseful today.  Donald Davidson is not usually considered a postmodernist, although he and Rorty have both acknowledged that there are few differences between their philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~knobe/rorty.html|title=An interview with Rorty|author=|date=|website=unc.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, D., 1986, "A Coherence Theory of Truth and Knowledge," Truth And Interpretation, Perspectives on the Philosophy of Donald Davidson, ed. Ernest LePore, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, afterwords.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Remote service software''' is used by equipment manufacturers to remotely monitor, access and repair products in use at customer sites. It’s a secure, auditable gateway for service teams to troubleshoot problems, perform proactive maintenance, assist with user operations and monitor performance.  This technology is typically implemented in mission-critical environments like hospitals or IT data centers – where equipment downtime is intolerable.

==Benefits==
Remote service software helps to:
* Increase uptime, improve performance and extend the life of a device
* Control service costs by deploying patches and upgrades remotely, and ensure a first-time fix when an onsite visit is required
* Streamline administration of pay-per-use models, with automated usage monitoring
* Focus highly trained service teams on preventative maintenance, by diagnosing and repairing issues before they cause system failure
* Increase customer satisfaction and loyalty

Manufacturers are using aftermarket service a competitive differentiator.  Remote service software provides a platform for manufacturers to offer and meet stringent [[service level agreement]]s (SLAs) without increasing the size of their service team.

== Key characteristics of remote service software==
* '''Proactive:''' Remote monitoring of devices in use allows service teams to detect potential issues before they escalate, degrade performance or cause a system failure. This early warning system is a key component to issue avoidance and ability to meet more stringent [[key performance indicators|key performance indicator]] (KPIs) in SLAs. Once an issue is detected, service professionals can also use remote service technology gateways to push patches or resolve issues.
* '''Secure:''' Secure access is a core consideration of remote service.  Solutions should adhere to compliance guidelines and protect the remote connection between the manufacturer and the customer – ensuring that no data has been stolen and no outsiders have been granted access.
* '''Auditable:''' [ [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[PCI DSS|PCI]] ] compliance regulations require businesses to keep track of who does what on their network.  Auditors require forensic logs to trace the steps of every interaction a remote service technician has with every device.

[[File:Husqvarna Automower 308 with track marks in lawn.jpg|thumb|A robotic lawn mower with visible track marks in a lawn indicating the random way it cuts the grass.]]
A '''robotic lawn mower''' is an [[autonomous robot]] used to cut [[lawn]] grass.  A typical [[robotic]] lawn mower (in particular earlier generation models) requires the user to set up a border wire around the lawn that defines the area to be mowed. The robot uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed and in some cases to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to {{convert|30000|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} of grass.

Robotic lawn mowers are increasingly sophisticated, are self-docking and some contain [[rain sensor]]s if necessary, nearly eliminating human interaction.  Robotic [[lawn mower]]s represented the second largest category of [[domestic robot]]s used by the end of 2005.

Possibly the first commercial robotic lawn mower was the MowBot, introduced and patented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-propelled random motion lawnmower |url=http://www.google.ca/patents?id=tEA0AAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1969-10-20|accessdate=2013-06-08}} {{US Patent|3698523}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 and already showing many features of today's most popular products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MowBot (Jan, 1969) |url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/mowbot/|date=2011-10-14|accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the growth of robotic lawn mower sales was 15 times that of the traditional styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rise of the Lawn-Cutting Machines |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-25/rise-of-the-lawn-cutting-machines|date=2012-10-25|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the emergence of smart phones some robotic mowers have integrated features within custom apps to adjust settings or scheduled mowing times and frequency, as well as manually control the mower with a digital joystick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Best Robot Lawn Mower On The Market |url=http://www.beststuff.com/gadgets/robomow-rs630-review-best-robot-lawn-mower/28881/|date=2014-05-09|accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
In 1995, the first fully [[solar power]]ed robotic mower became available.

The mower can find its [[charging station]] via [[radio frequency]] emissions, by following a boundary wire, or by following an optional guide wire.  This can eliminate wear patterns in the lawn caused by the mower only being able to follow one wire back to the station.

To get to remote areas or areas only accessible through narrow passages the mower can follow a guide wire or a boundary wire out of the station.

Batteries used include [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|nickel–metal hydride]] (NiMH), [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] and [[Lead–acid battery|lead-acid]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53997">The [[Session Initiation Protocol]] ('''SIP''') is the signaling protocol selected by the [[3GPP|3rd Generation Partnership Project]] (3GPP)&lt;ref name=RFC4083 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Camarillo /&gt; to create and control multimedia sessions with two or more participants in the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS), and therefore is a key element in the IMS framework.

SIP was developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)]] as a standard for controlling multimedia communication sessions in [[Internet Protocol|Internet Protocol (IP)]] networks, working in the [[application layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. Several '''SIP extensions''' have been added to the basic protocol specification in order to extend its functionality.&lt;ref name=TheIMS /&gt;&lt;ref name=RedHat /&gt;&lt;ref name=SNT /&gt; These extensions are based on [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) protocol recommendations by the IETF.

The 3GPP, which is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations aimed at developing and maintaining the IMS, stated a series of requirements for SIP&lt;ref name=RFC4083 /&gt; to be successfully used in the IMS. Some of them could be addressed by using existing capabilities and extensions in SIP while, in other cases, the 3GPP had to collaborate with the IETF to standardize new SIP extensions&lt;ref name=RFC7315 /&gt;  to meet the new requirements. In any case, the IETF evolves SIP in a generic basis, so that the use of its extensions is not restricted to the IMS framework.

== 3GPP requirements for SIP ==
The 3GPP has stated several general requirements stated for operation of the IMS. These include an efficient use of the [[Cellular network|radio interface]] by minimizing the exchange of signaling messages between the mobile terminal and the network, a minimum session setup time by performing tasks prior to session establishment instead of during session establishment, a minimum support required in the terminal, the support for [[roaming]] and non-roaming scenarios with terminal mobility management (supported by the access network, not SIP), and support for [[IPv6]] addressing.

Other requirements involve protocol extensions, such as SIP [[Header (computing)|header fields]] to exchange user or server information, and SIP [[List of SIP request methods|methods]] to support new network functionality: requirement for registration, re-registration, de-registration, event notifications, [[instant messaging]] or call control primitives with additional capabilities such as call transference.

Other specific requirements are:&lt;ref name=RFC4083 /&gt;
*[[Quality of service]] support with policy and charging control, as well as resource negotiation and allocation before alerting the destination user.
*Identification of users for [[Diameter protocol|authentication, authorization and accounting]] purposes. [[Computer security|Security]] between users and the network and among network nodes is a major issue to be addressed by using mutual [[authentication]] mechanisms such as [[Public-key cryptography|private and public keys]] and [[Cryptographic hash function|digests]], as well as media [[authorization]] extensions. It must be also possible to present both the caller and the called party the identities of their counterparts, with the ability to hide this information if required. [[Anonymity]] in session establishment and [[information privacy|privacy]] are also important.
*Protection of SIP signaling with integrity and confidentiality support based on initial authentication and [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric cryptographic keys]]; error recovery and verification are also needed.
*Session release initiated by the network (e.g. in case the user terminal leaves coverage or runs out of credit).
*[[Source routing|Source-routing mechanisms]]. The [[routing]] of SIP messages has its own requirements in the IMS as all terminal originated session setup attempts must transit both the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#CSCF – Call Session Control Function|P-CSCF and the S-CSCF]] so that these call session control functions (CSCFs) servers can properly provide their services. There can be special path requirements for certain messages as well.
*Interoperation between IMS and the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

Finally, it is also necessary that other protocols and network services such as [[DHCP]] or [[DNS]]&lt;ref name=RFC3263 /&gt; are adapted to work with SIP, for instance for outbound proxy (P-CSCF) location and SIP [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]] to [[IP address]] resolution, respectively.

== Extension negotiation mechanism ==
There is a mechanism&lt;ref name=Camarillo /&gt; in SIP for extension negotiation between user agents (UA) or servers, consisting of three [[Header (computing)|header]] fields: ''supported'', ''require'' and ''unsupported'', which UAs or servers (i.e. user terminals or [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#CSCF – Call Session Control Function|call session control function (CSCF)]] in IMS) may use to specify the extensions they understand. When a client initiates a SIP dialog with a server, it states the extensions it ''requires'' to be used and also other extensions that are understood (''supported''), and the server will then send a response with a list of extensions that it ''requires''. If these extensions are not listed in the client's message, the response from the server will be an error response. Likewise, if the server does not support any of the client's required extensions, it will send an error response with a list of its ''unsupported'' extensions. This kind of extensions are called ''option tags'', but SIP can also be extended with new [[List of SIP request methods|''methods'']]. In that case, user agents or servers use the ''Allow'' header to state which methods they support. To ''require'' the use of a particular method in a particular dialog, they must use an ''option tag'' associated to that method.

== SIP extensions  ==
=== Caller preferences and user agent capabilities ===
These two extensions allow users to specify their preferences about the service the IMS provides.

With the caller preferences extension,&lt;ref name=RFC3841 /&gt; the calling party is able to indicate the kind of user agent they want to reach (e.g. whether it is fixed or mobile, a voicemail or a human, personal or for business, which services it is capable to provide, or which methods it supports) and how to search for it, with three header fields: ''Accept-Contact'' to describe the desired destination user agents, ''Reject-Contact'' to state the user agents to avoid, and ''Request-Disposition'' to specify how the request should be handled by servers in the network (i.e. whether or not to redirect and how to search for the user: sequentially or in parallel).

By using the user agent capabilities extension,&lt;ref name=RFC3840 /&gt; user agents (terminals) can describe themselves when they register so that others can search for them according to their caller preferences extension headers. For this purpose, they list their capabilities in the ''Contact'' header field of the REGISTER message.

=== Event notification ===
The aim of event notification is to obtain the status of a given resource (e.g. a user, one's [[voicemail]] service) and to receive updates of that status when it changes.

Event notification is necessary in the IMS framework to inform about the ''presence'' of a user (i.e. "online" or "offline") to others that may be waiting to contact them, or to notify a user and its P-CSCF of its own ''registration'' state, so that they know if they are reachable and what public identities they have registered. Moreover, event notification can be used to provide additional services such as [[voicemail]] (i.e. to notify that they have new voice messages in their [[inbox]]).

To this end, the specific event notification extension&lt;ref name=RFC3265 /&gt; defines a framework for event notification in SIP, with two new methods: SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY, new header fields and response codes and two roles: the ''subscriber'' and the ''notifier''. The entity interested in the state information of a resource (the ''subscriber'') sends a SUBSCRIBE message with the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the resource in the request initial line, and the type of event in the ''Event header''. Then the entity in charge of keeping track of the state of the resource (the ''notifier''), receives the SUBSCRIBE request and sends back a NOTIFY message with a ''subscription-state header'' as well as the information about the status of the resource in the message body. Whenever the resource state changes, the ''notifier'' sends a new NOTIFY message to the ''subscriber''. Each kind of event a subscriber can subscribe to is defined in a new ''event package''. An ''event package'' describes a new value for the SUBSCRIBE ''Event header'', as well as a [[MIME]] type to carry the event state information in the NOTIFY message.

There is also an ''allow-events'' header to indicate event notification capabilities, and the ''202 accepted'' and ''489 bad event'' response codes to indicate if a subscription request has been preliminary accepted or has been turned down because the ''notifier'' does not understand the kind of event requested.

In order to make an efficient use of the signaling messages, it is also possible to establish a limited notification rate (not real-time notifications) through a mechanism called ''event throttling''. Moreover, there is also a mechanism for ''conditional event notification'' that allows the ''notifier'' to decide whether or not to send the complete NOTIFY message depending on if there is something new to notify since last subscription or there is not.

==== State publication ====
The event notification framework defines how a user agent can subscribe to events about the state of a resource, but it does not specify how that state can be published. The SIP extension for event state publication&lt;ref name=RFC3903 /&gt; was defined to allow user agents to publish the state of an event to the entity (''notifier'') that is responsible for composing the event state and distributing it to the ''subscribers''.

The state publication framework defines a new method: PUBLISH, which is used to request the publication of the state of the resource specified in the request-URI, with reference to the event stated in the ''Event header'', and with the information carried in the message body.

=== Instant messaging ===
The functionality of sending instant messages to provide a service similar to [[text messaging]] is defined in the instant messaging extension.&lt;ref name=RFC3428 /&gt; These messages are unrelated to each other (i.e. they do not originate a SIP dialog) and sent through the SIP signaling network, sharing resources with control messages.

This functionality is supported by the new MESSAGE method, that can be used to send an instant message to the resource stated in the request-URI, with the content carried in the message body. This content is defined as a [[MIME]] type, being ''text/plain'' the most common one.

In order to have an instant messaging session with related messages, the [[Message Session Relay Protocol]] (MSRP)&lt;ref name=RFC4975 /&gt; should be used.

=== Call transfer ===
The REFER method extension&lt;ref name=RFC3515 /&gt; defines a mechanism to request a user agent to contact a resource which is identified by a URI in the ''Refer-To'' header field of the request message. A typical use of this mechanism is call transfer: during a call, the participant who sends the REFER message tells the recipient to contact to the user agent identified by the URI in the corresponding header field. The REFER message also implies an [[#event notification|event subscription]] to the result of the operation, so that the sender will know whether or not the recipient could contact the third person.

However, this mechanism is not restricted to call transfer, since the ''Refer-To'' header field can be any kind of URI, for instance, an [[HTTP]] URI, to require the recipient to visit a [[web page]].

=== Reliability of provisional responses ===
In the basic SIP specification,&lt;ref name=RFC3261 /&gt; only requests and final responses (i.e. 2XX [[List of SIP response codes|response codes]]) are transmitted reliably, this is, they are retransmitted by the sender until the [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledge]] message arrives (i.e. the corresponding response code to a request, or the ACK request corresponding to a 2XX response code). This mechanism is necessary since SIP can run not only over reliable transport protocols ([[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]) that assure that the message is delivered, but also over unreliable ones ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) that offer no delivery guarantees, and it is even possible that both kinds of protocols are present in different parts of the transport network.

However, in such an scenario as the IMS framework, it is necessary to extend this reliability to provisional responses to INVITE requests (for session establishment, this is, to start a call). The reliability of provisional responses extension&lt;ref name=RFC3262 /&gt; provides a mechanism to confirm that provisional responses such as the ''180 Ringing'' [[List of SIP response codes|response code]], that lets the caller know that the callee is being alerted, are successfully received. To do so, this extension defines a new method: PRACK, which is the request message used to tell the sender of a provisional response that his or her message has been received. This message includes a ''RACK'' header field which is a [[sequence number]] that matches the ''RSeq'' header field of the provisional response that is being acknowledged, and also contains the ''CSeq'' number that identifies the corresponding INVITE request. To indicate that the user agent requests or supports reliable provisional responses, the ''100rel'' [[#Extension negotiation mechanism|option tag]] will be used.

=== Session description updating ===
The aim of the UPDATE method extension&lt;ref name=RFC3311 /&gt; is to allow user agents to provide updated session description information within a dialog, before the final response to the initial INVITE request is generated. This can be used to negotiate and allocate the call resources before the called party is alerted.

=== Preconditions ===
In the IMS framework, it is required that once the callee is alerted, the chances of a session failure are minimum. An important source of failure is the inability to reserve network resources to support the session, so these resources should be [[Resource allocation|allocated]] before the phone rings. However, in the IMS, to reserve resources the network needs to know the callee's IP address, port and session parameters and therefore it is necessary that the initial offer/answer exchange to establish a session has started (INVITE request). In basic SIP, this exchange eventually causes the callee to be alerted. To solve this problem, the concept of preconditions&lt;ref name=RFC3312 /&gt; was introduced. In this concept the [[calling party|caller]] states a set of constraints about the session (i.e. [[codecs]] and [[Quality of service|QoS]] requirements) in the offer, and the [[called party|callee]] responds to the offer without establishing the session or alerting the user. This establishment will occur if and only if both the caller and the callee agree that the preconditions are met.

The preconditions SIP extension affects both SIP, with a new [[#Extension negotiation mechanism|option tag]] (''precondition'') and defined offer/answer exchanges, and [[Session Description Protocol]] (SDP), which is a format used to describe [[streaming media]] initialization parameters, carried in the body of SIP messages. The new SDP attributes are meant to describe the ''current status'' of the resource reservation, the ''desired status'' of the reservation to proceed with session establishment, and the ''confirmation status'', to indicate when the reservation status should be confirmed.

==== The SDP offer/answer model using PRACK and UPDATE requests ====
In the IMS, the initial session parameter negotiation can be done by using the [[#Reliability of provisional responses|provisional responses]] and [[#Session description updating|session description updating]] extensions, along with SDP in the body of the messages.
The first offer, described by means of SDP, can be carried by the INVITE request and will deal with the caller's supported [[codec]]s. This request will be answered by the provisional reliable response code [[List of SIP response codes|183 Session Progress]], that will carry the SDP list of supported codecs by both the caller and the callee. The corresponding PRACK to this provisional answer will be used to select a codec and initiate the [[Quality of service|QoS]] negotiation.

The QoS negotiation is supported by the PRACK request, that starts resource reservation in the calling party network, and it is answered by a 2XX response code. Once this response has been sent, the called party has selected the codec too, and starts resource reservation on its side. Subsequent UPDATE requests are sent to inform about the reservation progress, and they are answered by 2XX response codes. In a typical offer/answer exchange,&lt;ref name=IMSCALL /&gt; one UPDATE will be sent by the calling party when its reservation is completed, then the called party will respond and eventually finish allocating the resources. It is then, when all the resources for the call are in place, when the caller is alerted.

=== Identification and charging ===
In the IMS framework it is fundamental to handle user identities for authentication, authorization and accounting purposes. The IMS is meant to provide multimedia services over IP networks, but also needs a mechanism to charge users for it. All this functionality is supported by new special header fields.

==== P-headers ====
The Private Header Extensions to SIP,&lt;ref name=RFC7315 /&gt; also known as P-Headers, are special header fields whose applicability is limited to private networks with a certain topology and characteristics of lower [[Abstraction layer|layers]]' protocols. They were designed specifically to meet the 3GPP requirements because a more general solution was not available.

These header fields are used for a variety of purposes including charging and information about the networks a call traverses:

*''P-Charging-Vector'': A collection of charging information, such as the IMS Charging Identity (ICID) value, the address of the SIP proxy that creates the ICID value, and the Inter Operator Identifier (IOI). It may be filled during the establishment of a session or as a standalone transaction outside a dialog.
*''P-Charging-Function-Address'': The addresses of the charging functions (functional entities that receive the charging records or events) in the user's home network. It also may be filled during the establishment of a dialog or as a standalone transaction, and informs each proxy involved in a transaction.
*''P-Visited-Network-ID'': Identification string of the visited network. It is used during registrations, to indicate to the user's home network which network is providing services to a [[roaming]] user, so that the home network is able to accept the registration according to their roaming agreements.
*''P-Access-Network-Info'': Information about the access technology (the network providing the connectivity), such as the [[Radio access network|radio access technology]] and [[Cell site|cell]] identity. It is used to inform service proxies and the home network, so that they can optimize services or simply so that they can locate the user in a [[wireless]] network
*''P-Called-Party-ID'': The URI originally indicated in the request-URI of a request generated by the calling user agent. When the request reaches the registrar (S-CSCF) of the called user, the registrar re-writes the request-URI on the first line of the request with the registered contact address (i.e. IP address) of the called user, and stores the replaced request-URI in this header field. In the IMS, a user may be identified by several SIP URIs (address-of-record), for instance, a SIP URI for work and another SIP URI for personal use, and when the registrar replaces the request-URI with the effective contact address, the original request-URI must be stored so that the called party knows to which address-of-record was the invitation sent.
*''P-Associated-URI'': Additional URIs that are associated with a user that is registering. It is included in the 200 OK response to a REGISTER request to inform a user which other URIs the service provider has associated with an address-of-record (AOR) URI.

More private headers have been defined for user database accessing:

*''P-User-Database'':&lt;ref name=RFC4457 /&gt; The address of the user [[database]], this is, the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#HSS – Home Subscriber Server|Home Subscriber Server (HSS)]], that contains the profile of the user that generated a particular request. Although the HSS is a unique master database, it can be distributed into different nodes for [[Reliability (computer networking)|reliability]] and [[scalability]] reasons. In this case, a [[Subscriber location function]] (SLF) is needed to find the HSS that handles a particular user. When a user request reaches the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#CSCF – Call Session Control Function|I-CSCF]] at the edge of the administrative domain, this entity queries the SLF for the corresponding HSS and then, to prevent the S-CSCF from having to query the SLF again, sends the HSS address to the S-CSCF in the '''P-User-Database''' header. Then the S-CSCF will be able to directly query the HSS to get information about the user (e.g. authentication information during a registration).&lt;ref name=IMSREG /&gt; 
*''P-Profile-Key'':&lt;ref name=RFC5002 /&gt; The [[database index|key]] to be used to query the user database (HSS) for a profile corresponding to the destination SIP URI of a particular SIP request. It is transmitted among proxies to perform faster database queries: the first proxy finds the key and the others query the database by directly using the key. This is useful when Wildcarded Service Identities are used, this is, Public Service Identities that match a [[regular expression]], because the first query has to resolve the regular expression to find the key.

==== Asserted identity ====
The private extensions for asserted identity within [[computational trust|trusted]] networks&lt;ref name=RFC3325 /&gt; are designed to enable a network of trusted SIP servers to assert the identity of [[Authentication|authenticated]] users, only within an administrative domain with previously agreed policies for generation, transport and usage of this identification information. These extensions also allow users to request privacy so that their identities are not spread outside the ''trust domain''. To indicate so, they must insert the privacy token ''id'' into the Privacy header field.&lt;ref name=RFC3323 /&gt;

The main functionality is supported by the ''P-Asserted-Identity'' extension header. When a proxy server receives a request from an untrusted entity and authenticates the user (i.e. verifies that the user is who he or she says that he or she is), it then inserts this header with the identity that has been authenticated, and then forwards the request as usual. This way, other proxy servers that receive this SIP request within the ''Trust Domain'' (i.e. the network of trusted entities with previously agreed security policies) can safely rely on the identity information carried in the P-Asserted-Identity header without the necessity of re-authenticating the user.

The ''P-Preferred-Identity'' extension header is also defined, so that a user with several public identities is able to tell the proxy which public identity should be included in the P-Asserted-Identity header when the user is authenticated.

Finally, when privacy is requested, proxies must withhold asserted identity information outside the trusted domain by removing P-Asserted-Identity headers before forwarding user requests to untrusted identities (outside the ''Trust Domain'').

There exist analogous extension headers for handling the identification of services of users,&lt;ref name=RFC6050 /&gt; instead of the users themselves. In this case, [[Uniform Resource Name]]s are used to identify a service (e.g. a voice call, an instant messaging session, an [[IPTV|IPTV streaming]])&lt;ref name=RFC5897 /&gt;

=== Security mechanisms ===
{{See also|IMS security}}
Access security in the IMS consists of first authenticating and authorizing the user, which is done by the S-CSCF, and then establishing secure connections between the P-CSCF and the user. There are several mechanisms to achieve this, such as:

*''[[HTTP]] [[digest access authentication]]'', which is part of the basic SIP specification &lt;ref name=RFC3261 /&gt; and leads to a [[Transport Layer Security]] connection between the user and the proxy.
*''HTTP digest access authentication using [[AKA (security)|AKA]]'',&lt;ref name=RFC3310 /&gt; a more secure version of the previous mechanism for [[cellular network]]s that uses the information from the user's [[smart card]] and commonly creates two [[IPsec]] security associations between the P-CSCF and the terminal.

The security mechanisms agreement extension for SIP&lt;ref name=RFC3329 /&gt; was then introduced to provide a secure mechanism for negotiating the security algorithms and parameters to be used by the P-CSCF and the terminal. This extension uses three new header fields to support the negotiation process:

*First, the terminal adds a ''security–client'' header field containing the mechanisms, authentication and encryption algorithms it supports to the REGISTER request.
*Then, the P-CSCF adds a ''security-server'' header field to the response that contains the same information as the client's but with reference to the P-CSCF. In case there are more than one mechanism, they are associated with a priority value.
*Finally, the user agent sends a new REGISTER request over the just created secure connection with the negotiated parameters, including a '''security-verify''' header field that carries the same contents as the previously received ''security-server'' header field. This procedure protects the negotiation mechanism from [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]s: if an attacker removed the strongest security mechanisms from the ''Security-Server'' header field in order to force the terminal to choose weaker security algorithms, then the ''Security-Verify'' and ''Security-Server'' header fields would not match. The contents of the ''Security-Verify'' header field cannot be altered as they are sent through the new established secure association, as long as this association is no breakable by the attacker in real time (i.e. before the P-CSCF discovers the [[Man-in-the-middle attack]] in progress.

==== Media authorization ====
The necessity in the IMS of reserving resources to provide [[quality of service]] (QoS) leads to another security issue: admission control and protection against [[denial-of-service attack]]s. To obtain transmission resources, the user agent must present an authorization token to the network (i.e. the policy enforcement point, or PEP) . This token will be obtained from its P-CSCF, which may be in charge of QoS policy control or have an interface with the policy control entity in the network (i.e. the policy decision function, or PDF) which originally provides the authorization token.

The private extensions for media authorization&lt;ref name=RFC3313 /&gt; link session signaling to the QoS mechanisms applied to media in the network, by defining the mechanisms for obtaining authorization tokens and the ''P-Media-Authorization'' header field to carry these tokens from the P-CSCF to the user agent. This extension is only applicable within administrative domains with [[Computational trust|trust]] relationships. It was particularly designed for specialized SIP networks like the IMS, and not for the general [[Internet]].

=== Source-routing mechanisms ===
[[Source routing]] is the mechanism that allows the sender of a message to specify partially or completely the route the message traverses. In SIP, the ''route'' header field, filled by the sender, supports this functionality by listing a set of proxies the message will visit. In the IMS context, there are certain network entities (i.e. certain [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#CSCF – Call Session Control Function|CSCFs]]) that must be traversed by requests from or to a user, so they are to be listed in the ''Route'' header field. To allow the sender to discover such entities and populate the ''route'' header field, there are mainly two extension header fields: ''path'' and ''service-route''.

==== Path ====
The extension header field for registering non-adjacent contacts&lt;ref name=RFC3327 /&gt; provides a ''Path'' header field which accumulates and transmits the SIP URIs of the proxies that are situated between a user agent and its registrar as the REGISTER message traverses then. This way, the registrar is able to discover and record the sequence of proxies that must be transited to get back to the user agent.

In the IMS every user agent is served by its P-CSCF, which is discovered by using the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] or an equivalent mechanism when the user enters the IMS network, and all requests and responses from or to the user agent must traverse this proxy. When the user registers to the home registrar (S-CSCF), the P-CSCF adds its own SIP URI in a ''Path'' header field in the REGISTER message, so that the S-CSCF receives and stores this information associated with the contact information of the user. This way, the S-CSCF will forward every request addressed to that user through the corresponding P-CSCF by listing its URI in the ''route'' header field.

==== Service route ====
The extension for service route discovery during registration&lt;ref name=RFC3608 /&gt; consists of a ''Service-Route'' header field that is used by the registrar in a 2XX response to a REGISTER request to inform the registering user of the entity that must forward every request originated by him or her.

In the IMS, the registrar is the home network's S-CSCF and it is also required that all requests are handled by this entity, so it will include its own SIP URI in the ''service-route'' header field. The user will then include this SIP URI in the ''Route'' header field of all his or her requests, so that they are forwarded through the home S-CSCF.

=== Globally routable user agent URIs ===
In the IMS it is possible for a user to have multiple terminals (e.g. a [[mobile phone]], a [[computer]]) or application instances (e.g. [[video telephony]], [[instant messaging]], [[voice mail]]) that are identified with the same public identity (i.e. SIP URI). Therefore, a mechanism is needed in order to route requests to the desired device or application. That is what a ''Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRU)''&lt;ref name=RFC5627 /&gt; is: a URI that identifies a specific user agent instance (i.e. terminal or application instance) and it does it globally (i.e. it is valid to route messages to that user agent from any other user agent on the Internet).

These URIs are constructed by adding the ''gr'' parameter to a SIP URI, either to the public SIP URI with a value that identifies the user agent instance, or to a specially created URI that does not reveal the relationship between the GRUU and the user's identity, for privacy purposes. They are commonly obtained during the registration process: the registering user agent sends a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) that uniquely identifies that SIP instance, and the registrar (i.e. S-CSCF) builds the GRUU, associates it to the registered identity and SIP instance and sends it back to the user agent in the response. When the S-CSCF receives a request for that GRUU, it will be able to route the request to the registered SIP instance.

=== Signaling compression ===
The efficient use of network resources, which may include a [[Cellular network|radio interface]] or other low-bandwidth access, is essential in the IMS in order to provide the user with an acceptable experience in terms of [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]. To achieve this goal, SIP messages can be [[Data compression|compressed]] using the mechanism known as ''SigComp''&lt;ref name=RFC3320 /&gt; (signaling compression).

Compression algorithms perform this operation by substituting repeated words in the message by its position in a [[Dictionary coder|dictionary]] where all these words only appear once. In a first approach, this dictionary may be built for each message by the compressor and sent to the decompressor along with the message itself. However, as many words are repeated in different messages, the extended operations for ''SigComp''&lt;ref name=RFC3321 /&gt; define a way to use a shared dictionary among subsequent messages. Moreover, in order to speed up the process of building a dictionary along subsequent messages and provide high [[Data compression ratio|compression ratios]] since the first INVITE message, SIP provides a static SIP/SDP dictionary &lt;ref name=RFC3485 /&gt; which is already built with common SIP and SDP terms.

There is a mechanism&lt;ref name=RFC3486 /&gt; to indicate that a SIP message is desired to be compressed. This mechanism defines the ''comp=sigcomp'' parameter for SIP URIs, which signals that the SIP entity identified by the URI supports ''SigComp'' and is willing to receive compressed messages. When used in request-URIs, it indicates that the request is to be compressed, while in Via header fields it signals that the subsequent response is to be compressed.

==== Content Indirection ====
In order to obtain even shorter SIP messages and make a very efficient use of the resources, the content indirection extension&lt;ref name=RFC4483 /&gt; makes it possible to replace a [[MIME]] body part of the message with an external reference, typically an [[HTTP]] URI. This way the recipient of the message can decide whether or not to follow the reference to fetch the resource, depending on the bandwidth available.

=== NAT traversal ===
[[Network address translation]] (NAT) makes it impossible for a terminal to be reached from outside its [[private network]], since it uses a private address that is mapped to a public one when packets originated by the terminal cross the NAT. Therefore, [[NAT traversal]] mechanisms are needed for both the [[signaling plane]] and the [[media plane]].

[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]'s [[Request for Comments|RFC 6314]]&lt;ref name=RFC6314 /&gt; summarizes and unifies different methods to achieve this, such as symmetric response routing and client-initiated connections for SIP signaling, and the use of [[STUN]], [[TURN]] and [[Interactive Connectivity Establishment|ICE]], which combines both previous ones, for [[Streaming media|media stream]]s

=== Internet Protocol version 6 compatibility ===
[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]'s [[Request for Comments|RFC 6157]]&lt;ref name=RFC6157 /&gt; describes the necessary mechanisms to guarantee that SIP works successfully between both [[Internet Protocol]] versions during the [[IPv6 deployment|transition]] to [[IPv6]]. While SIP signaling messages can be transmitted through heterogeneous [[IPv4]]/[[IPv6]] networks as long as proxy servers and [[DNS]] entries are properly configured to relay messages across both networks according to these recommendations, user agents will need to implement extensions so that they can directly exchange [[Streaming media|media streams]]. These extensions are related to the [[Session Description Protocol]] offer/answer initial exchange, that will be used to gather the IPv4 and IPv6 [[IP address|addresses]] of both ends so that they can establish a direct communication.

=== Interworking with other technologies ===
Apart from all the explained extensions to SIP that make it possible for the IMS to work successfully, it is also necessary that the IMS framework interworks and exchanges services with existing network infrastructures, mainly the [[Public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

There are several standards that address this requirements, such as the following two for services interworking between the PSTN and the [[Internet]] (i.e. the IMS network):
*''[[PSTN Interworking Service Protocol]] (PINT)'',&lt;ref name=RFC2848 /&gt; that extends SIP and SDP for accessing classic telephone call services in the PSTN (e.g. basic telephone calls, fax service, receiving content over the telephone).
*''[[Services in PSTN requesting Internet Services]] (SPIRITS)'',&lt;ref name=RFC3910 /&gt; that provides the opposite functionality to PINT, this is, supporting the access to Internet services from the PSTN.

And also for PSTN-SIP gateways to support calls with one end in each network:
*''Session Initiation Protocol for Telephones (SIP-T)'',&lt;ref name=RFC3372 /&gt; that describes the practices and uses of these gateways.
*''ISDN User Part (ISUP) to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Mapping'',&lt;ref name=RFC3398 /&gt; which makes it possible to translate SIP signaling messages into [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]] messages of the [[Signaling System No. 7]] (SS7) which is used in the PSTN, and vice versa.

Moreover, the SIP INFO method extension is designed to carry user information between terminals without affecting the signaling dialog and can be used to transport the [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling]] to provide [[telephone keypad]] function for users.&lt;ref name=RFC6086 /&gt;

'''[[Social network service|Social networking]]''' is one of the most active [[World Wide Web|web]]-based activities in the '''[[Philippines]]''', with Filipinos being declared as the most active [[User (computing)|users]] on a number of web-based social network sites such as [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Snapchat]] and [[Twitter]]. The use of social networking website has become so extensive in the Philippines that the country has been tagged as "The Social Networking Capital of the World," and has also become part of Filipino [[cyberculture]]. Social networking is also used in the Philippines as a form of election campaign material, as well as tools to aid criminal investigation.

==History==
Friendster is one of the first social networking websites in the World Wide Web when it was introduced in 2002. However, its popularity in the [[United States of America|United States]] plummeted quickly in 2004 due to massive technical problems and server delays.&lt;ref name=Wall&gt;{{cite news| first=Gary| last=Rivlin| title=Wallflower at the Web Party| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html?ei=5090&amp;en=3e9438ed349f7ce7&amp;ex=1318564800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all| publisher=New York Times| date=October 15, 2006| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as it was losing its American audience, Friendster slowly gained users from [[Southeast Asia]] starting in the Philippines. Friendster director of engineering Chris Lunt wondered why its web traffic was spiking in the middle of the night, and noticed that the traffic was coming from the Philippines. He then traced the trail to a [[Filipino-American]] marketing consultant and hypnotist named Carmen Leilani de Jesus as the first user to have introduced Friendster to the Philippines, where a number of her friends live.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;

==Statistics==
A study released by Universal McCann entitled "Power To The People - Wave3" declared the Philippines as "the social networking capital of the world," with 83 percent of Filipinos surveyed are members of a social network. They are also regarded as the top [[photograph|photo]] [[uploader]]s and [[web video]] viewers, while they are second when it comes to the number of [[blog]] readers and video uploaders.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universalmccann.com/Assets/wave_3_20080403093750.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921002044/http://www.universalmccann.com/Assets/wave_3_20080403093750.pdf| title=Power To The People: Social Media Tracker, Wave3| accessdate=2013-05-11|archivedate=2008-09-21| date=March 2008| publisher=Universal McCann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Capital&gt;{{cite news| first=Jerry| last=Liao| title=The Philippines - Social Networking Capital of the World| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/20/TECH20080520124703.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011094639/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/20/TECH20080520124703.html|archivedate=2008-10-11| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=May 20, 2008| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With over 7.9 million Filipinos using the [[Internet]], 6.9 million of them visit a social networking site at least once a month.&lt;ref name=Higher&gt;{{cite news| first=Giovanni Paolo| last=Yazon | title=Social networking to the higher level| url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife6_mar31_2007| publisher=Manila Standard Today| date=March 31, 2007| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Friendster has been the most visited [[website]] in the Philippines, as well as in [[Indonesia]], according to web tracking site [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].&lt;ref name=Asia&gt;{{cite news| first=Woo Liu| last=Ling| title=Friendster Moves to Asia| url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1707760,00.html| publisher=Time.com| date=January 29, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Jones, vice president for global marketing of Friendster, said that "the biggest percentage of (their site's) users is from the Philippines, clocking in with 39 percent of the site's traffic." He further added that in March 2008 alone, Friendster recorded 39 million unique visitors, with 13.2 million of whom were from the Philippines.&lt;ref name=Prolific&gt;{{cite news| first=Tessa| last=Salazar| title=Filipinos are prolific, go and Multiply| url=http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&amp;story_id=144061| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| pages=A1, A10| date=June 22, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Multiply president and founder Peter Pezaris said that the Filipino users of their site comprised the largest and most active group in terms of number of subscribers and of photographs being uploaded daily. About 2.2 million out of more than nine million registered users of Multiply are Filipinos, outnumbering even nationalities with a bigger population base like the United States, Indonesia, and [[Brazil]]. Also, one million photographs are uploaded by Filipinos to Multiply every day, which is half of their total number worldwide.&lt;ref name=Prolific /&gt;

Sixty percent of Filipino users of Multiply are female, while 70 percent are under the age of 25. In comparison, Filipino Friendster users are between the ages 16 to 30, with 55 percent of them female.&lt;ref name=Prolific /&gt;

==Application in Filipino culture and society==
The popularity of social networking in the Philippines can be traced in the Filipinos' culture of "friends helping friends." For Filipinos, their friends and who they know can become more valuable than money, especially when what they need can be achieved through [[nepotism]], favoritism, and friendship among others.&lt;ref name=Second&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/06/try_try_againorkut_friendster.html| title=Orkut, Friendster Get Second Chance Overseas| accessdate=2008-06-22| date=June 15, 2007| publisher=PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networking has extensive uses in the Philippines. It was used to promote television programs like [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus]] with its two profiles on Multiply. A [[call center]] company posted job openings on its Multiply community site and was able to attract recruits.&lt;ref name=Top&gt;{{cite news| first=David| last=Dizon| title=Filipinos are top Multiply users| url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/06/19/08/filipinos-are-top-multiply-users| publisher=ABS-CBNNews.com| date=June 19, 2005| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of social networking was tested in the country's [[Philippine general election, 2007|2007 general elections]] when senatorial candidate [[Francis Escudero]] created his own Friendster profile to bolster support from Filipino users.&lt;ref name=Chiz&gt;{{cite news| title=Chiz Escudero campaigns in cyberspace| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/02/26/INFO2007022688089.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924005703/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/02/26/INFO2007022688089.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=February 26, 2007|archive-date=2008-09-24| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually won a seat in the Senate.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; Local celebrities and politicians have since created their own profiles on Friendster as their medium to communicate with their fans and constituents.&lt;ref name=Stars&gt;{{cite news| first=Manny B.| last=Marinay| title=Stars use Friendster's Fan Profiles to reach out to fans| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/01/31/ENTR20080131115775.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924012738/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/01/31/ENTR20080131115775.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=January 31, 2009 |archive-date=2008-09-24| accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friendster was also used as a tool for police investigations. Local police in [[Cebu City]] were able to track down the suspects for the [[robbery]] and [[murder]] of a female [[nursing]] student on March 2008. After receiving information and tips from the public and other police operatives, the local police searched through the suspects' profiles in order to get a closer look at their faces. The police printed the pictures of the suspects and launched a series of police operations, which led to their arrest.&lt;ref name=Arrest&gt;{{cite news| first=Mars Jr. W| last=Mosqueda| title=Internet used to identify killers of nursing student| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/03/11/PROV20080311119134.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212001504/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/03/11/PROV20080311119134.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=March 11, 2008| archive-date=2009-02-12| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Manila]] Police District arrested a suspect for the murder of two guest relations officers in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] on January 2007 after they were able to find the suspect's whereabouts through his Friendster profile.&lt;ref name=Gro&gt;{{cite news| first=Natalie Jane M| last=Malayo| title=Suspect in killing of two GROs arrested| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/01/16/MTNN2007011684762.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929075156/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/01/16/MTNN2007011684762.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=January 16, 2007 |archive-date=2008-09-29| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networks also became a source of high-profile [[cyberwar]]s, notably between actors Ynez Veneracion and Mon Confiado against Juliana Palermo. The two accused Palermo of creating a fake Friendster profile of her ex-boyfriend Confiado, which is uploaded with photos of Confiado and his girlfriend Veneracion but laden with profanities in each caption.&lt;ref name=Hatester&gt;{{cite news| first=Walden| last=Sadiri| title=Ynez-Juliana feud turns Friendster to "Hatester?"| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/06/03/SPRT2007060395116.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212002039/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/06/03/SPRT2007060395116.html| publisher=Manila Bulletin| date=June 3, 2007 |archive-date=2009-02-12| |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his bid for the Philippine Presidency in May 2010, then Secretary of National Defense, [[Gilberto Teodoro]] launched an aggressive campaign via the social media. He capitalized on networks such as [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]]. He reportedly spent nearly a quarter of his campaign budget on the social media in the Philippines; in comparison to the current president’s [[Benigno Simeon Aquino III]] – 9%.&lt;ref name=Elections&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pulyetos.com/social-media-marketing-and-philippine-politics/ |title = Using Social Media Marketing to Win Elections in the Philippines |last = Manglaus |first = Roni |date = December 10, 2010 |website = Pulyetos |accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Filipino-American Internet personality [[Christine Gambito]], also known as HappySlip, criticized Friendster for displaying what she described as "inappropriate advertisements" that appear on her profile. She posted a message on the site's bulletin board addressing her fans that she contemplated deleting her account. Gambito had earlier deleted her [[MySpace]] account because she objected to the [[Google]]-powered online advertisements that she said "were in direct conflict with the HappySlip brand and especially misrepresentative of Filipino women." She particularly criticized the posting of advertisements of international [[Online dating service|dating websites]] that supposedly target Filipinas.&lt;ref name=Happy&gt;{{cite news| first=Erwin| last=Oliva| title=Happy Slip unhappy with "inappropriate" ads on Friendster| url=http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20080613-142434/Happy-Slip-unhappy-with-inappropriate-ads-on-Friendster| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=June 13, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Philippine National Police]] Director General Avelino Razon ordered the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group to find out who created a fake account on Friendster using his identity. The profile was laden with false information about him, saying that he "wants to meet traitors, corrupts, criminals so he could crush them."&lt;ref name=Razon&gt;{{cite news| first=Thea| last=Alberto| title=Razon not amused by "Friendster account"| url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view/20080117-113057/Razon-not-amused-by-Friendster-account| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=January 17, 2008| accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2008, there have been cases of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] comments in Friendster profiles, most of which are in the form of a [[JPEG]] image masquerading as an embedded [[YouTube]] video, with a thumbnail of a sexually explicit video clip, such as a girl undressing herself or something similar. Clicking on the image usually results in a redirect to a dubious or disreputable website, or worse, a [[drive-by download]] of [[malware]], such as the [[Koobface]] worm. Because some of the users, especially teenagers, who usually log on to the site in an [[Internet cafe]], have only limited knowledge about malware and/or computers in general, such social engineering attacks can be a significant risk. The site had received considerable criticism due to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://friendstertips.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/how-to-stop-friendster-spam/ How to stop Friendster spam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bukaspalad.com/board/showthread.php?t=4844 YouTube Virus?

==New Campaign==
On July 2011, [[GMA Network]] creates the new campaign ''Think Before You Click'' - a campaign by GMA News to promote responsible use of social media.
On August 2016, Rappler initiates the campaign "[http://www.rappler.com/views/143975-no-place-for-hate-change-comes-to-rappler-comments-thread #NoPlaceForHate]" - a campaign that encourages civility when engaging online.

The '''social positioning method''' (SPM) studies space-time behaviour by analysing the location coordinates of [[mobile phones]] and the social characteristics of the people carrying them. The SPM methods and experiments were developed in [[Estonia]] by Positium and Institute of Geography [[University of Tartu]] during 2003-2006 (''Ahas, R. &amp; Mark, Ü. (2005). Location based services - new challenges for planning and public administration? [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4750/is_200508/ai_n17323894] Futures 37, 547-561'').

The biggest advantage of mobile positioning-based methods is that mobile phones are widespread, positioning works inside buildings, and collection of movement data is done by a third party at regular intervals. Positioning data is digital; it is easy to trace many people at the same time and it is possible to analyse movements in real time. The disadvantage of mobile positioning today is relatively low preciseness, the boom in the generation of phones with a [[GPS]] will raise positioning accuracy.

The most important problems of SPM are related to data security, as well as concerns about non-authorized personal surveillance. These problems can be solved with further development of [[location-based service]]s (LBS) and relevant legal and organisational regulation. Today mobile positioning can be applied only by obtaining participants’ personal acceptance.

The initial model was introduced in 1982 as the FD-210, which had a grayscale five [[centimeter]] display. The device weighed around 650 [[gram]]s, with a measurement of 87 x 198 x 33 [[millimeter]]s. The device was sold in Japan with a price of 54,800 [[yen]]. Roughly two years later, in 1984, the device was introduced to [[Europe]] and [[North America]].

==Later releases==
[[File:Sony watchman models.jpg|thumb|Various models of Sony Watchmen]]
Sony manufactured more than 65 models of the Watchman before its discontinuation in 2000. Upon the release of further models after the FD-210, the display size increased, and new features were introduced. The FD-3, introduced in 1987, had a built-in digital clock. The FD-30, introduced in 1984 had a built-in AM/FM Stereo radio. The FD-40/42/44/45 were among the largest Watchmen, utilizing a 4" CRT display. The FD-40 introduced a single composite A/V input. The FD-45, introduced in 1986, was water-resistant. In 1988/1989, the FDL 330S color Watchman TV/Monitor with LCD display was introduced. In 1990, the FDL-310, a Watchman with a color [[Liquid crystal display|LCD display]] was introduced. The FD-280/285, made from 1990 to 1994, was the last Watchman to use a black and white CRT display. One of the last Watchmen was the FDL-22 introduced in 1998, which featured an ergonomic body which made it easier to hold, and introduced Sony's ''Straptenna'', where the wrist strap served as the antenna.

==Legacy==
Due to the switch of television broadcasts to digital, most models of the Sony Watchman have lost their usefulness, because they now require to be connected to a digital converter box.

==Marketing and media==
A model of the Sony Watchman is seen multiple times in the film [[Rain Man]].

The '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. The model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:
* '''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) – This was defined by Fred Davis as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]".
* '''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) – Davis defined this as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}).
The TAM has been continuously studied and expanded—the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} &amp; {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).

==History==

TAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989)
is the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology
(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747–768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}&lt;/ref&gt;). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&amp;mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).

Bagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:

:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})

Earlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms "task fit" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.

==Usage==
Several researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.

Segars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.

Mark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2×2 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).
The TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604–634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Venkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).

In an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.&lt;ref name=hf2010&gt;{{Cite journal

==Alternative models==
# The '''MPT model''': Independent of TAM, Scherer ({{harvnb|Scherer|1986}}) developed the [[matching person and technology model]] in 1986 as part of her National Science Foundation-funded dissertation research. The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), "Living in the State of Stuck", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.
# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.
# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments
|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238–247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
TAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a "theory" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM "has diverted researchers' attention away from other 
important research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the 
independent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29–47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).

Legris et al.&lt;ref&gt;Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.

Perceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}).

A study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. &amp; Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.

'''Technology dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[science and technology studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from "internal factors" as well as from "external factors". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the "inherent progress" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.

Conversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not "self-evident" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct "internal" and "external" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a "thick description" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.

Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==
*[[Social construction of technology]]
*[[Actor–network theory]]
*[[Systems theory]]
*[[Normalization process theory]]
*Quasi-evolutionary theories
*[[Innovation system]]
*[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

*[[Technology assessment]]
*[[Backcasting]]
*Strategic niche management 
*[[Transition management (governance)]]

'''Technology fusion''' involves a transformation of core technologies through a combination process facilitated by technological advances such as the phone and the Internet, which ensure that labs are no longer isolated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Market-Oriented Technology Management: Innovating for Profit in Entrepreneurial Times|last=Phillips|first=Fred|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9783642074561|location=Berlin|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in profitable advances that can be made cheaply by combining knowledge from different fields, companies, industries, and geographies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The technological fusion is distinguished from the so-called breakthrough approach, which is the linear technological development that replaces an older generation of technology through its focus on combining existing technologies into hybrid products that can revolutionize markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1992/07/technology-fusion-and-the-new-rd|title=Technology Fusion and the New R&amp;D|last=Kodama|first=Fumio|date=1992-07-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Fusion==
The fusion of technologies goes beyond mere combination. Fusion is more than complementarism, because it creates a new market and new growth opportunities for each participant in the innovation. It blends [[Incrementalism|incremental]] improvements from several (often previously separate) fields to create a product.&lt;ref name="Kodama1991"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kodama|first=Fumio|title=Analyzing Japanese High Technologies: The Techno-Paradigm Shift|publisher=Thomson Learning|date=September 1991|isbn=978-0-86187-835-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the fusion of mechanical and electronic engineering to create [[mechatronics]]. There is also the case of fusing chemical and electronics technology to produce the [[Liquid-crystal display|Liquid Crystal display]] (LCD) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=R&amp;D and Economy in Korea: With Selected Multinational Cases &amp; Theories|last=Kim|first=Junmo|publisher=iUniverse|year=2005|isbn=9780595375257|location=Lincoln, NE|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7742">A '''tectonic weapon''' is a hypothetical device or system which could create [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano]]es, or other seismic events in specified locations by interfering with the Earth's natural geological processes. It was defined in 1992 by Aleksey Vsevolovidich Nikolayev, corresponding member [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]: "A tectonic or seismic weapon would be the use of the accumulated tectonic energy of the Earth's deeper layers to induce a destructive earthquake".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA335648&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf 927N0104A Moscow ZNANIYE-Sila (in Russian) No. 1, Jan 92 p2-13, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology,  October 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; He added "to set oneself the objective of inducing an earthquake is extremely doubtful".

== Concept ==
Theoretically, the tectonic weapon functions by creating a powerful charge of [[elastic energy]] in the form of deformed volume of the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] in a region of tectonic activity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Disasters - Volume I|last=Kotlyakov|first=Valdimir|publisher=UNESCO/EOLSS Publishers|year=2010|isbn=9781848267596|location=Singapore|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This then becomes an earthquake once triggered by a nuclear explosion in the epicenter or a vast electric pulse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As to the question of whether a nuclear explosion can trigger an earthquake, there was the analysis of local seismic recordings within a couple of miles of nuclear tests in the 1960s at Nevada that showed nuclear explosions caused some tectonic stress.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-nuclear-explosions-cause-earthquakes?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products|title=Can nuclear explosions cause earthquakes?|website=www.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account provided by a member of the Nevada Commission on Nuclear Projects, also claimed that a 1968 underground nuclear test called Faultless successfully induced an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weather Warfare|last=Smith|first=Jerry|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|year=2006|isbn=9781931882606|location=Kempton, IL|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Geological Survey]] stated that it produced fresh fault rupture some 1200 meters long.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also a theory that 1998 earthquake in Afghanistan was triggered by thermonuclear tests conducted in Indian and Pakistani test sites 2-20 days prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Remote Sensing Technology for Tsunami Modelling and Forecasting|last=Marghany|first=Maged|publisher=CRC Press|year=2018|isbn=9780815386391|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=4-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Reports==
Roger Clark, lecturer in [[geophysics]] at [[Leeds University]] said in the respected journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 1996, responding to a newspaper report that there had been two secret Soviet programs, "Mercury" and "Volcano", aimed at developing a "tectonic weapon" that could set off earthquakes from great distance by manipulating electromagnetism, said "We don't think it is impossible, or wrong, but past experience suggests it is very unlikely". According to Nature these programs had been "unofficially known to Western geophysicists for several years". According to the story the Mercury program began in 1987, three tests were conducted in Kyrgyzstan, and Volcano's last test occurred in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=1zWNmzxDII&amp;dq=%22tectonic%20weapon%22%20-haiti&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tectonic%20weapon%22%20-haiti&amp;f=false R Clark, Nature, 10 October 1996, quoted in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Jan 1997, In Brief section]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such weapons, whether or not they exist or are feasible, are a source of concern in official circles. For example, US [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen|William S. Cohen]], said on 28 April 1997 at the Conference on Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy, [[University of Georgia]], while discussing the dangers of false threats, "Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/news/usa/1997/04/bmd970429d.htm  Federation of American Scientists]: Address by US Secretary of State at 1997 conference on terrorism&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's unsuccessful [[Project Seal]] programme during [[World War II]] attempted to create [[tsunami]] waves as a weapon. It was reported in 1999 that such a weapon might be viable.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_14884"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=14884 |title=Devastating tsunami bomb viable, say experts |author=Bingham, Eugene |date=28 September 1999 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Tesla]] claimed a small steam-powered [[Tesla's oscillator|mechanical oscillator]] he was experimenting with in 1898 produced earthquake-like effects, but this has never been replicated. The television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' in [[MythBusters (2006 season)#Episode 60 .E2.80.93 .22Earthquake Machine.22|Episode 60 .E2.80.93]] made a small machine based on the same principle but powered by electricity rather than steam; it produced vibrations in a large structure detectable 100&amp;nbsp;feet away, but no significant shaking, and they judged the effect to be a busted myth.

==International treaties==
The 1978 [[Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques]] is an international treaty ratified by 75 states, and signed by a further 17, that prohibits use of environmental modification techniques to cause earthquakes and [[tsunami]]s, amongst other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/t/isn/4783.htm US State Department: Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
After natural tectonic phenomena such as the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], [[conspiracy theories]], usually relating to the [[armed forces]] of the [[United States]] and formerly the [[Soviet Union]], often arise, though no [[evidence]] is advanced. After the Haiti earthquake it was widely reported that president [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]] made unsupported allegations that it had been caused by testing of a US tectonic weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/hugo-chavez-haiti-earthquake-tetonic-weapon-100129.html LiveScience: Chavez: US 'Tectonic Weapon' Caused Haiti Quake, 29 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] of [[Moscow]] reported on page 1 on 30 May 1992 that "a geophysical or tectonic weapon was actually developed in the [[USSR]] despite the UN Convention", but  that Chief Seismologist Major-General V Bochrov of the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|USSR Ministry of Defence]] categorically rejected any hints on the existence of tectonic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Komsomolskaya Pravda, 30 May 1992, p1, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology, 10 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
=="Earthquake bombs"==

While the British [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] and [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]] bombs of [[World War II]] were called ''[[earthquake bomb]]s'', the name came from their way of destroying very hardened targets by shaking their foundations as an earthquake would; they were never intended to cause an actual earthquake.

'''Zhongguancun''' ({{zh|first=s|s=中关村|t=中關村|p=Zhōngguāncūn}}), or '''Zhong Guan Cun''', is a technology hub in [[Haidian District]], [[Beijing]], [[China]].

It is geographically situated in the northwestern part of Beijing city, in a band between the northwestern [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|Third Ring Road]] and the northwestern [[4th Ring Road (Beijing)|Fourth Ring Road]].  Zhongguancun is very well known in China, and is often referred to as "China's [[Silicon Valley]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/51023.htm |title=Zhongguancun, China's Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:中关村广场西南景致.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The southwest landscape of Zhongguan plaza.]]
{{details|topic=the early history of the area|Haidian District}}

Zhongguancun has only existed since the 1950s and only became a household name in the early 1980s. The first person who envisioned the future for Zhongguancun was [[Chen Chunxian]], a member of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS), who came up with the idea for a [[Silicon Valley]] in China after he visited the U.S. as part of a government-sponsored trip. The location of the Chinese Academy of Sciences within Zhongguancun reinforced, and perhaps was in part responsible for the technological growth in this area.

Throughout the 1980s and still today, Zhongguancun was known as "electronics avenue," because of its connections to information technology and the preponderance of stores along a central, crowded street.

Zhongguancun was officially recognized by the central government of China in 1988. It was given the wordy name "Beijing High-Technology Industry Development Experimental Zone."

The current designation Zhongguancun refers commonly to the original site. However, officially (as of 1999) Zhongguancun has become the "Zhongguancun Science &amp; Technology Zone." It is a zone with seven parks, including Haidian Park, Fengtai Park, Changping Park, Electronics City (in Chaoyang), Yizhuang Park, Desheng Park, and Jianxiang Park.

The original Zhongguancun is now known as the Haidian Park of the Zhongguancun Zone. The area and environs, however, remain the same.

==Notable areas==
[[File:中关村科技园全景图.jpg|thumb|Panorama of tech hub.]]
[[File:20030511021028 - 中关村.jpg|thumb|Inside the Hailong market building.]]
[[Hailong Market]], [[Guigu Market]], [[Taipingyang Market]], [[Dinghao Market]] and [[Kemao Market]] are the five prominent IT and electronics markets. They are technology bazaars, famous for their "shops with a shop", where prices are easily but grudgingly bargained. Zhongguancun shops mainly deal in [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]-compatible hardware, peripherals and software. AppleCentre and Apple Experience Centre are also close by.

A very particular sight to visit is the [[Haidian Christian Church]], designed by Hamburg-based architects [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch-times.com/2010/05/22/zhongguancun-christian-church-gmp-architekten/ Zhongguancun Christian Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable education and research centres==
Due to the proximity and participation of China's two most prestigious universities, [[Peking University]] and [[Tsinghua University]], along with the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], many analysts elsewhere are optimistic about Zhongguancun's future prospects.

Notable high schools in Zhongguancun include [[Affiliated High School of Peking University]] and [[High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China]].

==Government and infrastructure==
The [[State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs]] (SAFEA) has its headquarters in Zhongguancun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safea.gov.cn/ Home]. [[State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs]]. Retrieved on July 12, 2017. "邮编：100873 地址：北京中关村南大街一号5号楼 "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable companies==
The most famous companies that grew up in Zhongguancun are [[Stone Group]], [[Founder Group]], and [[Lenovo Group]]. They were all founded in 1984-85. Stone was the first successful technology company to be operated by private individuals outside the government of China. Founder is a technology company that spun off [[Peking University]]. Lenovo Group spun off from [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] with [[Liu Chuanzhi]], a hero of Zhongguancun and current Chairmain, eventually taking the helm. Lenovo purchased IBM's PC division with $1.75 billion in 2005, making it the world's third-largest PC maker. Both Founder and Lenovo Group maintain strong connections to their academic backers, who are significant shareholders.

According to the 2004 Beijing Statistical Yearbook, there are over 12,000 high-tech enterprises throughout Zhongguancun's seven parks, with 489,000 technicians employed.
