[[File:40 Window world map.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|The nations in the 10/40 Window]]
The '''10/40 Window''' is a term coined by [[mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]] strategist and Partners International CEO [[Luis Bush]] in 1990&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030630/map/ |title=The 10/40 Window |work=Time |date=June 30, 2003| accessdate= March 1, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428234833/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030630/map/| archivedate= April 28, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}.

At the time, the authoritative source for socioeconomic and political metrics for every nation. Extreme poverty was denoted as under US$500 per capita GNP (in 1990 dollars).

What is least controversial is those areas with least access throughout history, as all metrics for such areas are zero or close to zero. Examples of metrics used include the presence of (Christian) work and workers (of any kind, whether community development, health, business, child care, house servants, etc), media in an appropriate language (print, TV, radio, web, etc.),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ow&gt;[[Operation World]] provides a concise well-researched/cited data summary for each nation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wce&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=David B.|author2=Kurian, George T.|author3=Johnson, Todd M.

The concept behind the ''10/40 Window'' highlights these three elements (as of data available in 1990): an area of the world with great poverty and low quality of life, combined with lack of access to Christian resources. The Window forms a band encompassing [[Sahara]]n and Northern Africa, as well as almost all of Asia (West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia and much of Southeast Asia). Roughly two-thirds of the world population lived in the 10/40 Window, and it is predominantly [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[animist]], [[Jewish]], or [[atheist]]. Many governments in the 10/40 Window are officially or unofficially opposed to Christian work of any kind within their borders.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wce/&gt;

==Origin==
This region of the world was previously known to Christians as the "resistant belt", as noted by [[Luis Bush]] at the 1989 [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne II Conference in Manila]]. In 1990, Bush's research led to a meeting with Pete Holzmann, a leader of the team developing the first PC-based [[GIS]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas GIS, produced by Strategic Mapping Inc., was the first PC Geographic Information System.{{cite news|url=http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php |title=ESRI Retires ArcCAD and Atlas GIS| accessdate= September 21, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070925180632/http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php| archivedate= September 25, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed the region using a box between 10 and 40 degrees north latitude and called it the ''10/40 box''. A few weeks later, Bush and his wife Doris were inspired to rename it the ''10/40 Window'', stating that this region ought to be seen as a "window of opportunity".{{citation needed |date= September 2007}} The analysis and concept was a generalization that focuses on a region, not a sharp boundary defining what is a priority, and what is not. For this reason, many missiologists prefer to use the phrase ''10/40 Window region''.

Before being called the "resistant belt", the Islamic portions of this region, as well as selected unreached Buddhist and Hindu areas, were referred to as the "unoccupied fields" by [[Samuel Marinus Zwemer|Samuel Zwemer]], in his book by that same title, published in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zwemer|first=Samuel M. |title=The Unoccupied Mission Fields of Africa and Asia|location=New York|publisher=Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions|page=260|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Some&lt;ref&gt;Verbal and online discussions, no documentation available outside of Wikipedia itself.&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to such a broad-brush term which seems to imply a unifying characteristic of the 10/40 Window when in fact no large area of the planet is completely homogenous in cultural attributes.

The 1990 research data states:
* this part of the world was home to the largest populations living in deep poverty and lowest [[quality of life]];&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mappoor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mapqual/&gt;
* this part of the world did have least access to Christian resources. Note the emphasis on ''access'' not ''percent Christian''. The West has ubiquitous access to such resources; this area of the world did and does not.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wce/&gt;

This research deals in overall population characteristics. The ''10/40 Window'' is a term that helps people visualize the general area of the analysis, where the above characteristics are generally true, but with exceptions proving it is only a generalization. Some examples of the exceptions:
* The 10/40 Window article refers to the "poorest of the poor" living in that region (based on late-1980s per-capita [[GNP]] under US$500).&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; Of the three billion people living in such poverty-stricken nations, 82% lived in the 10/40 Window. Yet the 10/40 Window also includes nations such as [[South Korea]] and Japan. In the late 20th century, Japan boasted the world's third largest economy, and South Korea the eleventh. Such nations were strong throughout the late 20th century.
* Geographically, the 10/40 Window includes the [[Philippines]] and [[Portugal]], which both have a Roman Catholic Christian majority; [[Greece]], where almost 98% of the population belonged to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]; and South Korea, which is home to the largest single congregation church in the world&lt;ref&gt;The largest congregation is in Seoul ([[Yoido Full Gospel Church]]) {{cite news |url=http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html |title=The Top 10 Churches in the World (by size)| accessdate= August 20, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162953/http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html| archivedate= September 27, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the second largest missionary-sending nation in the world.&lt;ref name=misinc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html |title=Missions Incredible|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107083606/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html|archivedate=November 7, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10/40 Window does not encompass [[Indonesia]] or Sri Lanka, nations that had very little access to Christian resources.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;

==Gaining widespread use==
Over the years, the 10/40 Window has evolved from a specialist term used by Christian [[Missiology|missiologists]] to assumed vocabulary for Christians in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=792 |title=Becoming Global Christians in the 21st Century By Justin Long – Charisma Magazine, (2001) |publisher=Charismamag.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=1575 |title=Islam and China's Christmas By David Aikman – Charisma Magazine, (2002) |publisher=Charismamag.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/tcw/2003/001/11.12.html |title=Marli Spieker &amp;#124; Today's Christian Woman &amp;#124; Your Life.

==Analysis==
The original 1990 GIS 10/40 Window analysis produced several insights, among them showing that the nations of the 10/40 Window represented (as of the research date):
*82% of the poorest of the world's poor (per capita GNP less than US$500 per year),&lt;ref name=mappoor&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poorest Countries &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*84% of those with lowest quality of life (life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy),&lt;ref name=mapqual&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Quality of Life &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the hub of the world's major non-Christian religions (Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.,)&lt;ref name=maprel&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Three Religious Blocks &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mapislam&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Islam &amp;  &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*close to 100% of those who were both most-poor ''and'' had least-access to Christian resources (two-dimensional analysis)&lt;ref name=mapprun&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poor, The Unevangelized, &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The least Christian resource investment&lt;ref&gt;Well below 10 percent in any of the study populations. Each of the cited maps provides side data on population, Christian involvement, etc in the various study populations (poor, low quality of life, non-Christian, etc)&lt;/ref&gt; and least sharing of the Christian message&lt;ref name=mapleast&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The 55 Least Evangelized Countries &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GIS analysis utilized country-level data from the Operation World&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; almanac, the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]],&lt;ref name=wce/&gt; and the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;

===Non-Christians in the 10/40 Window by religion===
The first edition GIS analysis maps highlighted the three major religious blocks in the 10/40 Window, specifically the majority Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist nations. Population estimates at the time for the year 2000 (from Operation World) were given as:
* 28 Muslim countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 2 Hindu countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 8 Buddhist countries, 237 million population est. (2000)

[http://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/1040.htm Later updates] have been based more on census data and other estimates rather than forward-looking population estimates. The cited reference provides the following estimate of "[[unreached]]" non-Christian populations in the 10/40 Window:
*865 million Muslims
*550 million Hindus
*275 million Buddhists
*140 million in 2550 tribal groups (mainly animist)
*17 million Jews&lt;ref&gt;Note that this number is higher than the census-based world total of 14 million. However, even authoritative [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html Jewish sources] state that many Jews do not identify themselves in population censuses.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nations in the 10/40 Window===
The 10/40 Window originally encompassed the following 57 countries. An expanded list including some important nearby nations is offered by the [[Joshua Project]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/resources/articles/10_40_window |title=What is the 10/40 Window? |publisher=joshuaproject.net |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect-multi|3|After death|Life after death|Hereafter}}
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |expanded=religion}}
'''Afterlife''' (also referred to as '''life after death''') is the concept that an [[essence|essential part]] of an individual's [[Personal identity|identity]] or the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] continues to manifest after the [[death]] of the physical body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire [[soul]] or [[spirit]], of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian [[nirvana]]. Belief in an afterlife, which may be [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[supernatural]], is in contrast to the belief in [[eternal oblivion|oblivion after death]].

In some views, this continued existence often takes place in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be [[#Reincarnation|reborn]] into [[World (theology)|this world]] and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or [[Otherworld]]. Major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]].

Some belief systems, such as those in the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic tradition]], hold that the dead go to a specific [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] after death, as determined by [[God]], or other [[divine judgment]], based on their [[orthopraxy|actions]] or [[orthodoxy|beliefs]] during life. In contrast, in systems of [[#Reincarnation|reincarnation]], such as those in the [[Indian religions]], the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life, rather than through the decision of a different being.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Different metaphysical models==
[[Theists]] generally believe some type of afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions tend to believe in an afterlife, but without reference to a deity. The [[Sadducees]] were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.

Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.

===Reincarnation===
{{main|Reincarnation}}
Reincarnation is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=24-29, 171}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}} It is a central tenet of all major [[Indian religions]], namely [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita M.

McClelland|2010|pp=102–103}} and a belief in rebirth/[[metempsychosis]] was held by Greek historic figures, such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates]], and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;see Charles Taliaferro, Paul Draper, Philip L. Quinn, ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''. John Wiley and Sons, 2010, page 640, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA640 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]], and [[Eckankar]] and is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as [[Australia]], [[East Asia]], [[Siberia]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere, ''Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth''. University of California Press, 2002, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of denominations within the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Kabbalah]], the [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924]. ''Origins of the Druze People and Religion, with Extracts from their Sacred Writings (New Edition)''. Columbia University Oriental Studies. '''28'''. London: Saqi. pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-86356-690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rosicrucians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]] (1985) [1939, 1908] ''The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures (Collected Works)'': [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcl/rcleng01.htm#lecture1 The Riddle of Life and Death]. Oceanside, California. 4th edition. {{ISBN|0-911274-84-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of [[Neoplatonism]], [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Manicheanism]], and [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Roman era]] as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;An important recent work discussing the mutual influence of ancient Greek and Indian philosophy regarding these matters is ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' by [[Thomas McEvilley]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity Church]] and its founder [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]] teach reincarnation.

===Heaven and hell===
{{Main|Heaven|Hell}}
[[Heaven]], the heavens, [[seven heavens]], [[pure land]]s, [[Tian]], [[Jannah]], [[Valhalla]], or [[the Summerland]], is a common [[Religious cosmology|religious, cosmological]], or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] place where beings such as [[Deity|gods]], [[angel]]s, [[jinn]], [[saint]]s, or [[Veneration of the dead|venerated ancestors]] are said to originate, be [[throne|enthroned]], or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or [[Incarnation|incarnate]], and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases [[Entering Heaven alive|enter heaven alive]].

Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the [[Sacred|holiest]] place, a [[paradise]], in contrast to [[hell]] or the [[underworld]] or the "low places", and [[Universal reconciliation|universally]] or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of [[divinity]], [[good and evil|goodness]], [[piety]], [[faith]] or other [[virtue]]s or [[orthodoxy|right beliefs]] or simply the [[will of God]]. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a [[world to come]].

In [[Indian religions]], heaven is considered as ''[[Svarga|Svarga loka]]''. There are seven positive regions the soul can go to after death and seven negative regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/afterlife/life-after-death/|title=Life after death - Where do we go after we die?|work=SSRF English|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing its stay in the respective region, the soul is subjected to [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in different living forms according to its ''[[karma]]''. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves ''[[Moksha]]'' or ''[[Nirvana]]''. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as [[otherworld]].

[[Hell]], in many religious and [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions, is a place of [[torture|torment]] and [[punishment]] in the afterlife. [[Religion]]s with a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[Divinity|divine]] history often depict hell as an [[eternal damnation|eternal destination]],&lt;!--(for example, see [[Christian views on hell]])--&gt; while religions with a [[reincarnation|cyclic history]] often depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s.&lt;!--(for example, see Chinese [[Diyu]])--&gt; Typically, these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the [[earth]]'s surface and often include entrances to hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include [[purgatory]] and [[limbo]].

Traditions that do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward merely describe hell as an [[Bosom of Abraham|abode of the dead]], the [[grave]], a neutral place (for example, [[sheol]] or [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) located under the surface of earth.

==Ancient religions==

===Ancient Egyptian religion===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife}}
The afterlife played an important role in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], and its belief system is one of the earliest known in recorded history. When the body died, parts of its soul known as ''ka'' (body double) and the ''ba'' (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the [[Aaru|Fields of Aaru]], [[Osiris]] demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Taylor, ''Death and the afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87436-939-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at one's reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords and formulae of the [[Book of the Dead]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart was weighed against the ''Shu'' feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard| first = Katheryn | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon [[Ammit]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Demeritt, ''Ptah's Travels: Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt'', 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian "coffin" carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in a [[mastaba]], could the [[Resurrection of the Dead|dead live again]] in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewellery, and 'curses'. They also used the "opening of the mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman, ''Encyclopedia of death and dying'', 2001, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Lunis, ''Tut's Deadly Tomb'', 2010, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through [[mummification]], and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the ''ka'', the ''ba'', and the ''akh''. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Fleming, Alan Lothian, ''Ancient Egypt's Myths and Beliefs'', 2011, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by [[User (ancient Egyptian official)|User]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb|title=Door to Afterlife found in Egyptian tomb |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2008-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110016/http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb |archivedate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a powerful adviser to the [[18th dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a 'door to the Afterlife'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in [[Roman Egypt]].

===Ancient Greek and Roman religions===
{{main|Greek underworld}}
The Greek god [[Hades]] is known in [[Greek mythology]] as the king of the [[underworld]], a place where souls live after death.&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Retief and L. Cilliers, "Burial customs, the afterlife and the pollution of death in ancient Greece", ''Acta Theologica'' '''26'''(2), 2006, p. 45 ([http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52560/41166 PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek god [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River [[Styx]], the river between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies School Service, ''Ancient Greece'', 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased's tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by [[Aeacus]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and King [[Minos]]. The soul would be sent to [[Elysium]], [[Tartarus]], [[Asphodel Fields]], or the Fields of Punishment. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil.&lt;ref&gt;Perry L. Westmoreland, ''Ancient Greek Beliefs'', 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks. Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. In the ancient Greek myth about the [[Labours of Heracles]], the hero [[Heracles]] had to travel to the underworld to capture [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.

In ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', [[Cicero]] describes what seems to be an [[out of body experience]], of the [[soul]] traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.&lt;ref&gt;N. Sabir, ''Heaven Hell Or'', 2010, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book VI of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the hero, [[Aeneas]], travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas' former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, [[Lethe]], which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.

===Norse religion===
{{main|Norse religion#Afterlife|Death in Norse paganism}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The [[Poetic Edda|Poetic]] and [[Prose Edda]]s, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:
* [[Valhalla]]: (lit. "Hall of the Slain" i.e. "the Chosen Ones") Half the warriors who die in battle join the god [[Odin]] who rules over a majestic hall called Valhalla in [[Asgard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.viking-mythology.com/theNineWorlds.php|title=Norse Mythology {{!}} The Nine Worlds|website=www.viking-mythology.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fólkvangr]]: (lit. "Field of the Host") The other half join the goddess [[Freyja]] in a great meadow known as Fólkvangr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spangenhelm.com/folkvangr-freyjas-field-warriors/|title=Fólkvangr, Freyja welcomes you to the Field of the Host|date=2016-05-20|work=Spangenhelm|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hel (realm)|Hel]]: (lit. "The Covered Hall") This abode is somewhat like [[Hades]] from Ancient Greek religion: there, something not unlike the [[Asphodel Meadows]] can be found, and people who have neither excelled in that which is good nor excelled in that which is bad can expect to go there after they die and be reunited with their loved ones.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* [[Niflhel]]: (lit. "The Dark" or "Misty Hel") This realm is roughly analogous to Greek [[Tartarus]]. It is the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths and commit other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===
{{main|Jewish eschatology}}

====She'ol====
[[She'ol]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]], is a place of darkness to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillness and darkness cut off from life and from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rainwater|1996|p=819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=June 2017}}

The inhabitants of Sheol are the "shades" (''[[rephaim]]''), entities without personality or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under some circumstances they are thought to be able to be contacted by the living, as the [[Witch of Endor]] contacts the shade of [[Samuel]] for [[Saul]], but such practices are forbidden (Deuteronomy 18:10).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knobel|2011|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the [[Second Temple period]] (roughly 500 BC–70 AD) a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone.&lt;ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"&gt;{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into [[Septuagint|Greek]] in ancient [[Alexandria]] around 200 BC, the word "[[Hades]]" (the [[Greek underworld]]) was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the [[New Testament]] where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the [[evil]] it represents.&lt;ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"/&gt;

====World to Come====
The [[Talmud]] offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the ''Olam Haba'' or [[world to come]]. Most do not enter the world to come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a "re-schooling", with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of "eternal [[damnation]]", so prevalent in other religions, is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm |title=Tractate Sanhedrin: Interpolated Section: Those Who have no Share in the World to Come |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html |title=Jehoiakim |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] describes the ''Olam Haba'' in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the [[Messianic era]]. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was "housed" during its earthly existence.

The [[Zohar]] describes [[Gehenna]] not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-9.html |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Jewish Thought (6/12)Section - Question 12.8: What do Jews say happens when a person dies? Do Jews believe in reincarnation? In hell or heaven? Purgato |publisher=Faqs.org |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reincarnation in Jewish tradition====
Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings,&lt;ref&gt;Saadia Gaon in Emunoth ve-Deoth Section vi&lt;/ref&gt; according to rabbis such as Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism,&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{YouTube|mM8dn68vgD8|Reincarnation in the Jewish Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

[[Shraga Simmons]] commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5-10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_reincarnation.htm |title=Ask the Rabbi - Reincarnation |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an "ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism". The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. [[Onkelos]], a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, "Let Reuben live and not die&amp;nbsp;..." (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, [[Nachmanides]] (Ramban 1195–1270), attributed Job's suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job's saying "God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to&amp;nbsp;... the light of the living' (Job 33:29,30)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yirmiyahu |first=Rabbi |url=http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/1077 |title=Reincarnation « Ask! « Ohr Somayach |publisher=Ohr.edu |date=2003-07-12 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reincarnation, called ''[[gilgul]]'', became popular in [[folk belief]], and is found in much [[Yiddish]] literature among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. [[Martin Buber]]'s early collection of stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Buber, "Legende des Baalschem" in ''Die Chassidischen Bücher'', Hellerau 1928, especially ''Die niedergestiegene Seele''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. Saadia Gaon, in [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (Hebrew: "beliefs and opinions") concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]] (reincarnation). While rebutting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.

Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716181413/http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=Reincarnation and the Holocaust FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.

Among the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'', "The Gates of Reincarnation", is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.

Rabbi Naftali Silberberg of The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] notes that "Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where does the soul go?

===Christianity===

{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[Mainstream Christianity]] professes belief in the [[Nicene Creed]], and [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use]] include the phrase: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come." Although punishments are made part of certain Christian conceptions of the afterlife, the prevalent concept of "eternal damnation" is a tenet of the Christian afterlife.

When questioned by the [[Sadducees]] about the [[resurrection of the dead]] (in a context relating to who one's spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), [[Jesus]] said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the [[angels]] in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2022:23-33;&amp;version=47; |title=Matthew 22:23-33 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the [[Son of God]], and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXD.HTM |title=The New American Bible - IntraText |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Enoch]] describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in [[Paradise]], the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Fosdick, Harry Emerson]]. A guide to understanding the Bible. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1956. page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.

The book of [[2 Maccabees]] gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.

[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 056.jpg|right|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]'s ''Inferno'': a Christian vision of hell]]
The author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] recounts the story of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] writes about God and the angels versus [[Satan]] and [[demons]] in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged. There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]].

The non-canonical [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]] speak of the efficacy of [[prayer for the dead]], so that they might be "translated to a state of happiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html Acts of Paul and Thecla] 8:5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] pictures the [[underworld]] ([[Hades]]) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the [[bosom of Abraham]] their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the "[[Lake of fire|lake of unquenchable fire]]" into which they are destined to be cast.

Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote that a person "may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, ''after his departure out of the body'', he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been ''purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire''" (emphasis added)—Sermon on the Dead, AD 382, quoted in [http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp The Roots of Purgatory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527235028/http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp |date=May 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of "purgatorial flames".

The noun [[Purgatory|"purgatorium"]] (Latin: place of cleansing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/purgatory "purgatory"]. The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003. Answers.com 06 Jun. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after life. The same word in adjectival form (''purgatorius -a -um'', cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2339625 |title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, '&amp;#39;A Latin Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and [[Pope Gregory I]] to refer to an after-death cleansing.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]''.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/heaven-and-hell-dole/contents/10|title=Swedenborg, E. '&amp;#39;Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg Foundation, 2000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as [[marriage]] in heaven (where all [[angels]] are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), [[time]] and [[space]] in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the [[eternity]] of [[Hell]] (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"/&gt;

====The Catholic Church====
The "Spiritual Combat", a written work by [[Lorenzo Scupoli]], states that four assaults are attempted by the “evil one” at the hour of death.&lt;ref&gt;http://stjudetheapostleparish.org/pdf/books/spiritual_combat.pdf#page35&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that [[Particular judgment|after the body dies, the soul is judged]], the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented [[mortal sin]] go to hell. In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry [[venial sin]] go to a place called [[Purgatory]] where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

=====Limbo=====
{{main|Limbo}}
Despite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a [[dogma]] of the [[Catholic Church]], yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, [[Virtue#Christianity|virtuous]] individuals who lived before [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus Christ was born on earth]], or those that die before [[baptism]] exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the [[beatific vision]], nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal [[sin]] although they have not received baptism, so still bear [[original sin]]. So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.

In other [[Christian denominations]] it has been described as an [[intermediate state|intermediate place]] or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/limbo |title=limbo - definition of limbo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Purgatory=====
{{main|Purgatory}}
The notion of [[purgatory]] is associated particularly with the [[Catholic Church]]. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a "cleansing fire" although it is not always called purgatory.

[[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the [[resurrection of the dead]] and in the possibility of "continuing to grow in holiness there", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of [[Prayer for the dead|helping by prayer]] any who may be in that state.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials (Abingdon 1999), quoted in [http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 Feature article by ''United Methodist Reporter'' Managing Editor Robin Russell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154244/http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 |date=2011-07-22 }} and in [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=4746355&amp;content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&amp;notoc=1 FAQ Belief: What happens immediately after a person dies?]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred.  Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner.  Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that "the 'location' of one’s final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative."&lt;ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"&gt;[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=19 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud &amp; Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2011), 245.]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. "The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience."&lt;ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"/&gt; For instance, [[St. Isaac the Syrian]] observes that "those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners . . . [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability."&lt;ref&gt;St. Isaac the Syrian, "Homily 28," In ''The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian,'' trans. Dana Miller (Brookline, MA: Holy Transfiguration Monastery Press, 1984), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.  Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19-21 as their model: "19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God." As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. [[Thomas Hopko]] writes, "[I]t is precisely the presence of God’s mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives. . . . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be "all and in all," with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God's gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain."&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Thomas Hopko, "Foreword," in ''The Orthodox Church'', Sergius Bulgakov (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1988), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of ''[[apokatastasis]]'', or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by [[Origen]], but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including [[Gregory of Nyssa]]. The [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553 C.E.) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen's brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn't teach.  It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as [[Olivier Clément]], Metropolitan [[Kallistos Ware]], and Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=25 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud &amp; Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2011), 251.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a [[wikt:theologoumenon#English|theologoumena]], it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection.  As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, "It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,"&lt;ref&gt;Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church (New York: Penguin, 1997), 262.&lt;/ref&gt; as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints====
{{main|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}
[[File:000 preach-my-gospel 1207575 tmb.jpg|framed|Plan of Salvation in LDS Religion]]

[[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or "hell" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20?lang=eng (1 Peter 3:18-20)] and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned "permanently" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived– Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.(1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where we can live eternally with our families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to "True to the Faith" (a handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith), "The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have "received the testimony of Jesus" and been "made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood" (D&amp;C 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/kingdoms-of-glory.p1?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] occasionally use terms such as "afterlife"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|title=Is Gehenna a Place of Fiery Torment?|date=April 1, 2011|page=31|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011252}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand [[Ecclesiastes]] 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reasoning From the Scriptures|pages=168–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the [[Great Flood]] or at [[Armageddon]], are given no hope of an afterlife. However, they believe that after Armageddon there will be a bodily resurrection of "both righteous and unrighteous" dead (but not the "wicked"). Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insight on the Scriptures|volume=2|pages=574–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death (non-existence).

====Seventh-day Adventists====
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, teaches that the first death, or death brought about by living on a planet with sinful conditions (sickness, old age, accident, etc.) is a sleep of the soul. Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul. Like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten." (Eccl. 9:5 KJV). Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is [[immortality|immortal]]. Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus' second coming. Until then, all those who have died are "asleep". When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever. (Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10; Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19; 2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.)&lt;ref&gt;White, E.G.

===Islam===
[[File:Mohammed´s Paradise.jpg|thumb|An artists representation of "Muhammed's Paradise". A [[Persian miniature]] from ''The History of Mohammed'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris.]]
[[File:Idris the prophet.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] is shown the afterlife places by an [[Angels in Islam|angel]]. In hell, the inmates are tormented by a [[Shaitan|demon]].]]
{{Main|Islamic view of death|Barzakh|Akhirah}}
The Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the [[Quran]] is descriptive. The [[Arabic]] word for Paradise is ''[[Jannah]]'' and Hell is ''[[Jahannam]]''. Their level of comfort while in the grave (according to some commentators) depends wholly on their level of ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being ([[God]] or [[Allah]]). In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy ''iman'' one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of ''iman'' chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice [[Islam]] long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire ''[[tasbih]]'' and recite the names of Allah in such manner as ''Subahann Allah'' or "[[Glory (religion)|Glory]] be to Allah" over and over again to acquire good deeds.

In the Quran, God gives warning about grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife (''[[Akhirah]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|17|10|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admonishes mankind that Hell is prepared for those who deny the meeting with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|18|103|e=106|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship Allah alone, which includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode, be it punishment or ''Jannat'' in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.

''Jannah'' and ''Jahannam'' both have different levels. ''Jannah'' has eight gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. ''Jahannam'' possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during [[Judgment Day]], which commences after the Angel [[Israfil]] blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.

In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e61?_hi=2&amp;_pos=1 |title=Afterlife - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |doi=10.1093/0195156498.001.0001 |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central doctrine of the Quran is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.

Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.

The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: "Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them?").

On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge (as thin as human hair and sharper than a razor) in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever.

====Ahmadiyya====
[[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an "embryonic soul" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own rights over that of others becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iU1Yn4sSXEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=elementary+study+of+islam&amp;q=elementary%20study%20of%20islam | title=An Elementary Study of Islam | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad| page=50 |publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-562-5| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sufi====
The Sufi scholar [[Ibn 'Arabi]] defined [[Barzakh#Sufism|Barzakh]] as the intermediate realm or "isthmus." It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, "is anything that separates two things". It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.&lt;ref name="Ibn Al-Arabi 2006 29n,50n, 59,64–8, 73,75–8, 82, 102"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Al-Arabi|first=Muhyiddin|title=The Universal Tree and The Four Birds|year=2006|publisher=Anqa Publishing|pages=29n,50n, 59, 64–8, 73, 75–8, 82, 102|editor=Angela Jaffray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith on life after death}}
The teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] state that the nature of the afterlife is beyond the understanding of those living, just as an unborn fetus cannot understand the nature of the world outside of the [[womb]]. The [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] state that the soul is immortal and after death it will continue to progress until it attains [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God's presence]]. In Bahá'í belief, souls in the afterlife will continue to retain their individuality and consciousness and will be able to recognize and communicate spiritually with other souls whom they have made deep profound friendships with, such as their [[Marriage|spouses]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Smith|first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|title= burial, "death and afterlife", evil, evil spirits, sin |year= 2000|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1|pages= 96–97, 118–119, 135–136, 322–323| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í scriptures also state there are distinctions between souls in the afterlife, and that souls will recognize the worth of their own deeds and understand the consequences of their actions. It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baha'i view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The [[Upanishads]] describe reincarnation (''punarjanma'') (see also: [[samsara]]). The [[Bhagavad Gita]], an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, [[Krishna]] says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called ''mukti'' (Sanskrit: मुक्ति) and staying finally with supreme God forever; is ''[[moksha]]'' (Sanskrit: मोक्ष) or salvation.

The [[Garuda Purana]] deals solely with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death [[Yama]] sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person's body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person's timings &amp; deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama's assistant, Chitragupta.

According to the Garuda Purana, a soul after leaving the body travels through a very long and dark tunnel towards the South. This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.

The soul, called ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or ''[[karma]]'' performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad karmas in "[[Naraka (Hinduism)|naraka]]" or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in ''[[swarga]]'' or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as ''Mrutyulok'' or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only &amp; only ''yajna karma'' (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as ''moksha'' or ''[[nirvana]]'', which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. ''Atma'' moves with ''[[Parmatma]]'' or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an ''Atma'' or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements—Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of ''narkas'' or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad ''karmas'' and dealt with accordingly.

Hindus also believe in ''karma''. ''Karma'' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. ''Satkarma'' means good deeds, ''vikarma'' means bad deeds. According to [[Hinduism]] the basic concept of karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good karma brings good rewards and bad karmas lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when [[Arjuna]] hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus "Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a ''[[kshatriya]]'' (warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Buddhist eschatology}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
Buddhists maintain that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without an unchanging [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] or soul passing from one form to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Carl B. |title=Breaking the circle: death and the afterlife in Buddhism |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |isbn=0-585-03949-6 |page=viii |quote=Buddhists believe in karma and rebirth, and yet they deny the existence of permanent souls.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions ([[Karma in Buddhism|kamma or karma]]). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a [[Preta|hungry ghost]] or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness ([[metta]]), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.

Yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to [[Theravada]] Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] of [[Mahayana]] believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called [[Pure Land]]. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha's name.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.

"Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Sikhism===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
[[Sikhism]] may have a belief in the afterlife. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However it's been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhism's belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses the afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'', but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.

Also it has been noted by many scholars that the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] includes poetic renditions from multiple saints and religious traditions like that of [[Kabir]], [[Baba Farid|Farid]] and [[Ramananda]]. The essential doctrine is to experience the divine through simple living, meditation and contemplation while being alive. Sikhism also has the belief of being in union with God while living. Accounts of afterlife are considered to be aimed at the popular prevailing views of the time so as to provide a referential framework without necessarily establishing a belief in the afterlife. Thus while it is also acknowledged that living the life of a householder is above the metaphysical truth, Sikhism can be considered agnostic to the question of an afterlife. Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2011/j1312p52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and in ''[[Dasam granth]]'', so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1248308791&amp;ucat=7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
[[Jainism]] also believes in the after life. They believe that the soul takes on a body form based on previous karmas or actions performed by that soul through eternity. Jains believe the soul is eternal and that the freedom from the cycle of reincarnation is the means to attain eternal bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jhaveri|first1=Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai|title=Death the Awakener|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/death-the-awakener-2110.htm|website=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|publisher=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional African religions===
[[Traditional African religion]]s are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife. [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies such as the [[Hadza people|Hadza]] have no particular belief in an afterlife, and the death of an individual is a straightforward end to their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bond|first1=George C.|editor1-last=Obayashi|editor1-first=Hiroshi|title=Death and Afterlife: Perspectives of World Religions|date=1992|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0-313-27906-3|pages=3–18|chapter=Living with Spirits: Death and Afterlife in African Religions|quote=The entire process of death and burial is simple, without elaborate rituals and beliefs in an afterlife.

===Shinto===
{{further|Shinto#Afterlife}}
It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a [[Japanese funeral|Buddhist funeral]] at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called ''[[yomi]]'' (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This ''yomi'' very closely resembles the Greek [[Greek underworld|Hades]]; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even [[Elysium]]-like descriptions such as in the legend of [[Okuninushi]] and [[Susanoo]]. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called ''kegare''. However, death is also viewed as a path towards [[apotheosis]] in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor [[Ojin]] who was enshrined as [[Hachiman]] the God of War after his death.

===Unitarian Universalism===
Some [[Unitarian Universalist]]s believe in [[universalism]]: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bond |first1=Jon |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |title=Unitarians: unitarian view of afterlife, unitarian universalist association uua, unitarian universalist association |publisher=En.allexperts.com |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106125811/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |archivedate=2015-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism - Page 147, Mark W. Harris - 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although Unitarians historically believed in a literal hell, and Universalists historically believed that everyone goes to heaven, modern Unitarian Universalists can be categorized into those believing in a heaven, reincarnation and oblivion. Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Searching for Spiritual Unity&amp;nbsp;...

===Spiritualism===
According to [[Edgar Cayce]], the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology. The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls. The second, Mercury's realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole. The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures. The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus. The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars. The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world. The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the soul's ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions. The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability. The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious. This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.&lt;ref name="Afterlife"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Bartlett|date=2015|title=The Afterlife Bible: The Complete Guide to Otherworldly Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9781841814490|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=9781841814490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream [[Spiritualist]]s postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayce's nine realms ruled by the planets. As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness. The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level. The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe. The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance. The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth. The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind. At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality. Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of "soulfulness" and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.&lt;ref name="Afterlife"/&gt;

===Wicca===
The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as [[The Summerland]]. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on Your Own - Page 162, Arin Murphy-Hiscock - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Frashokereti}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Zoroastrianism states that the ''urvan'', the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the [[Gathas|Ustavaiti Gathas]] with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the [[Yasna]]. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon [[Vizaresa]] (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness ([[hell]]).

[[Jamshid|Yima]] is believed to have been the first [[king]] on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima's realm, the [[spirits]] live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.

Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses [[Chinvat bridge]] which is the [[Final Judgment]] of the soul. Rashnu and [[Sraosha]] are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include [[Bahman|Vahman]] and [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]]. [[Rashnu]] is the [[yazata]] who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.

[[Misvan Gatu]] is the "place of the mixed ones" where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu's scale is equal.

The [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply [[scientific method]]s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like [[William Crookes]], and philosophers such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[William James]].

Parapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of [[haunting]], [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]], and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref&gt;David Fontana (2005): Is there an afterlife. A comprehensive overview of the evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; But also the study of the near death experience. Scientists who have worked in this area include [[Raymond Moody]], [[Susan Blackmore]], [[Charles Tart]], [[William James]], [[Ian Stevenson]], [[Michael Persinger]], [[Pim van Lommel]] and [[Penny Sartori]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profezie3m.altervista.org/archivio/TheLancet_NDE.htm |title=Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands |publisher=Profezie3m.altervista.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7463606.stm | accessdate = 6 August 2008 | work=BBC News | title=Nurse writes book on near-death | date=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[21 grams experiment|study]] conducted in 1901 by physician [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]] sought to measure the weight lost by a human when the [[soul]] "departed the body" upon death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roach | first = Mary | title = Spook – Science Tackles the Afterlife | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Co. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-393-05962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. Although MacDougall's results varied considerably from "21 grams", for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/religion/soulweight.asp Urban Legends] - Reference Page (Soul man).&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the 2003 movie ''[[21 Grams]]'' is a reference to MacDougall's findings. His results have never been reproduced, and are generally regarded either as meaningless or considered to have had little if any scientific merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Robert Ezra|title=Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science|page=90|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|isbn=0-691-14597-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Tipler]] has argued that [[physics]] can explain immortality, though such arguments are not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] and thus do not qualify, in [[Karl Popper]]'s views, as science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Franl, J. | title = The Physics of Immortality – Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead | publisher = Anchor | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-385-46799-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 25 years of parapsychological research, [[Susan Blackmore]] came to the conclusion that there is no [[empirical evidence]] for an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Chapters/Kurtz.htm |title=Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers pp 85–94 |publisher=Susanblackmore.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kurtz | first = Paul | title = Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-57392-884-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Modern philosophy===
There is still the position, based on the philosophical question of [[personal identity]], termed [[open individualism]], and in some ways similar to the old belief of [[monopsychism]], that concludes that individual existence is illusory, and our consciousness continues existing after death in other conscious beings. Positions regarding existence after death were supported by some notable physicists such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Freeman Dyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death. [[Peter van Inwagen]], in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc|title=I Look for the Resurrection of the Dead and the Life of the World to Come |author=Peter van Inwagen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012631/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc |archivedate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hick]] also raises some questions regarding personal identity in his book, ''Death and Eternal Life'' using an example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another. If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.

===Process philosophy===
In the [[panentheistic]] model of [[process philosophy]] and theology the writers [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]] rejected that the universe was made of [[Matter|substance]], instead reality is composed of living experiences (occasions of experience). According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in [[God]], who contains all that was. However other process philosophers such as [[David Ray Griffin]] have written that people may have subjective experience after death.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes (Albany: State University of New York, 1984) p.&amp;nbsp;32–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Griffin, "The Possibility of Subjective Immortality in Whitehead's Philosophy," in The Modern Schoolman, LIII, November. 1975, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&amp;C=2598 What Is Process Theology? by Robert B. Mellert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109062948/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&amp;C=2598 |date=2013-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2736&amp;C=2480 A Whiteheadian Conception of Immortality by Forrest Wood, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205005800/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2736&amp;C=2480 |date=2011-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Regarding the [[mind–body problem]], most neuroscientists take a [[physicalism|physicalist]] position according to which consciousness derives from and/or is reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity occurring in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Schwartz. ''Appendix D: Consciousness and the Neurobiology of the Twenty-First Century''. In Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM. (2000). ''Principles of Neural Science, 4th Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580394,00.html "The Brain: The Mystery of Consciousness"]. Time. Monday, January 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this premise is that once the brain stops functioning at [[brain death]], consciousness fails to survive and [[eternal oblivion|ceases to exist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181–1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Laureys|Laureys, Steven]]; Tononi, Giulio.

Academic Press. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-0-12-374168-4}} "In brain death there is irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain including the brainstem. Consciousness is, therefore, permanently lost in brain death."&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological proposals for the origin of a belief in an afterlife include cognitive disposition, cultural learning, and as an intuitive religious idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pereira|first1=Vera|last2=Faísca|first2=Luís|last3=de Sá-Saraiva|first3=Rodrigo|title=Immortality of the Soul as an Intuitive Idea: Towards a Psychological Explanation of the Origins of Afterlife Beliefs|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=1|page=121|doi=10.1163/156853712X633956|url=http://sapientia.ualg.pt/bitstream/10400.1/4894/1/Immortality%20of%20the%20soul%20as%20an%20intuitive%20idea.%20Towards%20a%20psychological%20explanation%20of%20the%20origins%20of%20afterlife%20beliefs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, children were able to recognize the ending of physical, mental, and perceptual activity in death, but were hesitant to conclude the ending of will, self, or emotion in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Misailidi|first1=Plousia|last2=Kornilaki|first2=Ekaterina N|title=Development of Afterlife Beliefs in Childhood: Relationship to Parent Beliefs and Testimony|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=April 2015|volume=61|issue=2|pages=290–318|issn=0272-930X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty sidebar}}
'''Belief''' is the state of [[mind]] in which a person thinks something to be the case with or without there being [[empirical evidence]] to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. Another way of defining belief sees it as a [[mental representation]] of an [[Intentionality|attitude positively oriented]] towards the [[likelihood]] of something being [[truth|true]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Primmer |first= Justin |editor-last= Primmer |editor-first= Justin |contribution= Belief |title= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab |location= Stanford, CA |year= 2018|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/ |accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek thought]], two related concepts were identified with regards to the concept of belief: ''[[Pistis#Pistis in rhetoric|pistis]]'' and ''[[doxa]]''. Simplified, we may say that ''pistis'' refers to "trust" and "confidence", while ''doxa'' refers to "opinion" and "acceptance".  The English word "[[orthodoxy]]" derives from ''doxa''.  Jonathan Leicester suggests that belief has the purpose of guiding action rather than indicating [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Primmer|first1= Justin|title= The nature and purpose of belief|journal= Journal of Mind and Behavior|date= 2018|volume= 29|issue= 3|pages= 219–239|url= http://philpapers.org/rec/LEITNA|accessdate= 3 June 2018 | quote = The purpose of belief is to guide action, not to indicate truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epistemology]], philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to personal attitudes
associated with [[truth value|true or false]] ideas and concepts. However, "belief" does not require active [[introspection]] and circumspection. For example, we never ponder whether or not the sun will rise. We simply assume the sun will rise. Since "belief" is an important aspect of mundane life, according to Eric Schwitzgebel in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', a related question asks: "how a physical organism can have beliefs?"&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/] – "The 'mind-body problem', for example, so central to philosophy of mind, is in part the question of whether and how a purely physical organism can have beliefs." Retrieved 01 July 2016.

==Knowledge and epistemology==
[[Epistemology]] is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and [[opinion]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries – [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/epistemology definition] published by [[OUP]] [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt; and involved generally with a theoretical [[philosophical]] study of [[knowledge]]. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where the epistemology of Socrates (Platon) most clearly departs from that of the [[sophist]]s, who at the time of Plato seem to have defined knowledge as what is here expressed as "[[justified true belief]]". The tendency to translate from belief (here: doxa – common opinion) to knowledge (here: episteme), which Plato (e.g. [[Socrates]] of the dialogue) utterly dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a [[dispositive]] belief (gr. 'doxa', not 'pistis') from knowledge (episteme) when the opinion is regarded ''true'' (here: orthé), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the [[rhetor]]s to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between belief (i.e. opinion) and [[knowledge]] even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule, and is able to add ''justification'' (gr. [[logos]]: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friesian.com/knowledg.htm – Copyright (c) 2007, 2008 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato has been credited for the "''justified true belief''" theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)]] elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty. Among American epistemologists, [[Edmund Gettier|Gettier]] (1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gettier |first=E. L. |year=1963 |title=Is justified true belief knowledge? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=121–123 |doi= 10.1093/analys/23.6.121|jstor=3326922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]] (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=A. I. |year=1967 |title=A causal theory of knowing |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=357–372 |doi= 10.2307/2024268|jstor=2024268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned the "justified true belief" definition, and challenged the "sophists" of their time.

==As a psychological phenomenon==
Mainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.

The concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). So, like other [[propositional attitude]]s, belief implies the existence of [[mental state]]s and [[intentionality]], both of which are hotly debated topics in the [[philosophy of mind]], whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.

Beliefs are sometimes divided into [[core beliefs]] (that are actively thought about) and ''[[dispositional belief]]s'' (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked "do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?" a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=V. |last2=Halligan |first2=P. W. |last3=Ellis |first3=H. D. |year=2006 |chapter=A Cognitive Neuroscience of Belief |editor1-first=Peter W. |editor1-last=Halligan |editor2-first=Mansel |editor2-last=Aylward |title=The Power of Belief: Psychological Influence on Illness, Disability, and Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-853010-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has important implications for understanding the [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]] of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent, then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes that support it will fail.

Philosopher [[Lynne Rudder Baker]] has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her controversial book ''Saving Belief'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lynne Rudder |last=Baker |title=Saving Belief: A Critique of Physicalism |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1989 |location= |isbn=0-691-07320-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct - Sometimes called the "mental sentence theory," in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities, and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavour. [[Jerry Fodor]] is one of the principal defenders of this point of view.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions – This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we know it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says "I believe that snow is white" and how a future theory of psychology will explain this behaviour. Most notably, philosopher [[Stephen Stich]] has argued for this particular understanding of belief.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory that will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it – Known as [[eliminativism]], this view (most notably proposed by [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]) argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as [[the four humours]] theory of medicine, or the [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion. In these cases science hasn't provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchlands argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong; however, treating people, animals, and even computers as if they had beliefs is often a successful strategy – The major proponents of this view, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]], are both [[eliminativism|eliminativists]] in that they hold that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they don't go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the opposition's queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett ''the [[intentional stance]]'', belief-based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience, although both may be explanatory at their own level.
Strategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:
(1) Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity's ability to enforce them.
(2) Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.
(3) Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3–13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological belief compared to religious belief==
Historically ''belief-in'' belonged in the realm of religious thought, ''belief-that'' instead belonged to epistemological considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = H. H. | year = 1965 | title = Belief 'In' and Belief 'That' | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2400996 | journal = Religious Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 01| pages = 5–27 | doi = 10.1017/S0034412500002304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief-in===
To "believe in" someone or something is a distinct concept from "believing-that." There are at least these types of belief-in:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacIntosh |first=J. J. |year=1994 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-15948893/belief-revisited-reply-williams.html |title=Belief-in Revisited: A Reply to Williams |journal=Religious Studies |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=487–503 |doi=10.1017/S0034412500023131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Commendatory''' / '''[[Faith]]''' - we may make an expression of 'faith' in respect of some performance by an agent X, when without prejudice to the truth value of the factual outcome or even confidence in X otherwise, we expect that specific performance. In particular [[self-confidence]] or faith in one's self is this kind of belief.
* '''Existential claim''' – to claim belief in the existence of an entity or phenomenon in a general way with the implied need to justify its claim to existence. It is often used when the entity is not real, or its existence is in doubt. "He believes in witches and ghosts" or "many children believe in Santa Claus" or "I believe in a deity" are typical examples.&lt;ref name="belief-in"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macintosh |first=Jack |chapter=Belief-in |title=[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] |page=86 |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguistic form is distinct from the assertion of the truth of a proposition since verification is either considered impossible/irrelevant or a [[counterfactual]] situation is assumed.

===Belief-that===
====Economical belief====
Economic beliefs are beliefs which are reasonably and necessarily contrary to the tenet of rational choice or instrumental rationality.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Taylor-Gooby – [https://www.issa.int/html/pdf/jeru98/theme3/3-1a.pdf ECONOMIC BELIEFS AND SOCIAL POLICY BEHAVIOUR] [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (Economic Beliefs and behaviour research programme) [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the Austrian tradition of the economic thought, in the context of analysis of the influence and subsequent degree of change resulting from  existing economic knowledge and belief, has contributed the most to the subsequent holistic collective analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Arena"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWtuUnc1u4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBGoVChMI1N-8qfSbxwIVzLUUCh0tuwX3&amp;q=economic%20beliefs|author=R. Arena &amp; A. Festré|title=Knowledge, Beliefs and Economics|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing 1 Jan 2006, 288 pages, |ISBN=1847201539|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Delusion====
Insofar as the truth of belief is expressed in sentential  and propositional form we are using the sense of ''belief-that'' rather than ''belief-in''. [[Delusion]] arises when the truth value of the form is clearly nil.&lt;ref name="L. Bortolotti"&gt;{{cite book |author=L. Bortolotti|title=Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs|publisher=OUP Oxford 2010, 299 pages, ''International Perspectives in Philosophy &amp; Psychiatry'' |ISBN=0199206163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski-truth/ ''Tarski's Truth Definitions''], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/ ''LOTH''] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences" Alfred Tarski Dover 1995/41, Ch. I, &amp;sect; 2 ''Expressions containing variables—sentential and designatory functions'' and Ch. II ''On the Sentential Calculus'' in its entirety&lt;/ref&gt;

Delusions are defined as beliefs in [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria&lt;ref&gt;[http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2013/06/delusions-in-dsm-5.html ''Delusions in the DSM 5''] A blog by Lisa Bortolotti &amp; Ema Sullivan-Bissett&lt;/ref&gt; (for example in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''). Psychiatrist and historian [[G.E. Berrios]] has challenged the view that delusions are genuine beliefs and instead labels them as "empty speech acts," where affected persons are motivated to express false or bizarre belief statements due to an underlying psychological disturbance. However, the majority of mental health professionals and researchers treat delusions as if they were genuine beliefs.

In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] says, "Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." This is often quoted in mockery of the common ability of people to [[Credo quia absurdum|entertain beliefs contrary to fact]].

==Formation==
[[File:Ripples of influence.jpg|thumb|We are influenced by many factors that ripple through our minds as our beliefs form, evolve, and may eventually change]]

Psychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three models of belief formation and change have been proposed:

===The conditional inference process===
When people are asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, they search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate a) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and b) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two probabilities differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false (respectively). Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"&gt;Wyer, R. S., &amp; Albarracin, D. (2005). Belief formation, organization, and change: Cognitive and motivational influences. In D. Albarracin, B. T. Johnson, &amp; M. P. Zanna, The Handbook of Attitudes (273–322). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear models of belief formation===
Unlike the previous model, this one takes into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, this model predicts belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

===Information processing models of belief formation and change===
These models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported. Instead, these responses reflect the number and meaning of the thoughts that people have about the message at the time that they encounter it.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

Some influences on people's belief formation include:
* Internalization of beliefs during childhood, which can form and shape our beliefs in different domains. [[Albert Einstein]] is often quoted as having said that "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen." Political beliefs depend most strongly on the political beliefs most common in the community where we live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Andrew Gelman |first=Andrew |last=Gelman |first2=David |last2=Park |first3=Boris |last3=Shor |first4=Joseph |last4=Bafumi |first5=Jeronimo |last5=Cortina |title=Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-13927-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals believe the [[religion]] they were taught in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Argyle |title=The Psychology of Religious Behaviour, Belief and Experience |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-12330-5 |page=25 |quote=Religion, in most cultures, is ascribed, not chosen. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charismatic leaders can form and/or modify beliefs (even if those beliefs fly in the face of all previous beliefs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Hoffer |title=The True Believer |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |year=2002 |isbn=0-06-050591-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is belief voluntary? Rational individuals need to reconcile their direct reality with any said belief; therefore, if belief is not present or possible, it reflects the fact that contradictions were necessarily overcome using [[cognitive dissonance]].
* [[Advertising]] can form or change beliefs through repetition, shock, and association with images of sex, love, beauty, and other strong positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Kilbourne |first2=Mary |last2=Pipher |title=Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel |location= |publisher=Free Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-684-86600-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to intuition, a delay, known as the [[sleeper effect]], instead of immediate succession may increase an advertisement's ability to persuade viewer's beliefs if a discounting cue is present.&lt;ref&gt;see Kumkale &amp; Albarracin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical trauma, especially to the head, can radically alter a person's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Babette |last=Rothschild |title=The Body Remembers: The Psychophysiology of Trauma and Trauma Treatment |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-393-70327-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even against their own self-interest. In Anna Rowley's book, Leadership Therapy, she states "You want your beliefs to change. It's proof that you are keeping your eyes open, living fully, and welcoming everything that the world and people around you can teach you." This means that peoples' beliefs should evolve as they gain new experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowley |first=Anna |title=Leadership Therapy: Inside the Mind of Microsoft |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=69 |isbn=1-4039-8403-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justified true belief&lt;!--'Justified true belief' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Justified true belief'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a definition of [[knowledge]] that gained approval during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], 'justified' standing in contrast to 'revealed'. There have been attempts to trace it back to [[Plato]] and his dialogues.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;The received view holds it that Plato's theory presents knowledge as remembering eternal truths and justification reawakens memory, see {{cite book |last=Fine |first=G. |chapter=Introduction |title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms: Selected Essays |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-924558-4 |pages=5–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, an agent &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows that a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true [[if and only if]]:
# &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; believes that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, and
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is justified in believing that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true

This theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of [[Gettier problem]]s, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but that many philosophers disagree that anything is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chisholm | first = Roderick | title = The Foundations of Knowing | chapter=Knowledge as Justified True Belief |publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8166-1103-3 |authorlink=Roderick Chisholm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Nozick]] suggested{{Year needed|date=April 2017}} a [[Gettier problems#Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking|clarification]] of "justification" which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false. Bernecker and Dretske (2000) argue that "no epistemologist since Gettier has seriously and successfully defended the traditional view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernecker |first=Sven|last2= Dretske|first2= Fred|date= 2000|title= Knowledge. Readings in contemporary epistemology|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|isbn= 978-0198752615}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  On the other hand, Paul Boghossian argues that the Justified True Belief account is the "standard, widely accepted" definition of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Boghossian on Justification"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |publication-place = Oxford, UK |author = Paul Boghossian |url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-knowledge-9780199230419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |title = Fear of Knowledge: Against relativism and constructivism |publication-date = 2007 }}, Chapter2, p 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
{{see also|Belief revision}}
An extensive amount of scientific research and philosophical discussion exists around the modification of beliefs, which is commonly referred to as belief revision.
Generally speaking, the process of belief revision entails the believer weighing the set of truths and/or evidence, and the dominance of a set of truths or evidence on an alternative to a held belief can lead to revision.  One process of belief revision is [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian updating]] and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity.  However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.

There are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of [[persuasion]].   Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as  [[consciousness raising]] when considered in an activist or political context.
Belief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes.  Because [[goal]]s are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.

Whether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence.  This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as [[Source credibility|credibility]]; [[Peer pressure|social pressures]]; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification.  Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.

==Partial==
Without qualification, "belief" normally implies a lack of [[doubt]], especially insofar as it is a designation of a [[life stance]]. In practical everyday use however, belief is normally partial and retractable with varying degrees of certainty.

A copious literature exists in multiple disciplines to accommodate this reality. In mathematics [[probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[fuzzy set theory]], and other topics are largely directed to this.

==Prediction==
Different psychological models have tried to predict people's beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, [[Robert S. Wyer|Robert Wyer]] developed a model of subjective probabilities.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |year=1970 |title=Quantitative prediction of belief and opinion change: A further test of a subjective probability model |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=559–570 |doi=10.1037/h0030064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |last2=Goldberg |first2=L. |year=1970 |title=A probabilistic analysis of the relationships among beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=100–120 |doi=10.1037/h0028769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., "It will rain tomorrow"), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the [[law of total probability]] might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by "and" or "or" do not follow the model as well.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg" /&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Religion collage updated.jpg|thumb]]
Religious belief refers to attitudes towards [[mythological]], [[supernatural]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of a [[religion]].{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Religious belief is distinct from [[religious ritual|religious practice]] and from [[religious behaviour]]s – with some believers not practicing [[religion]] and some practitioners not believing religion. Religious beliefs, deriving from ideas that are exclusive to religion,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} often relate to the existence, characteristics and worship of a [[deity]] or deities, to the idea of [[Miracle|divine intervention]] in the [[universe]] and in [[human life (disambiguation)|human life]], or to the [[deontological]]  explanations for the values and practices centered on the teachings of a [[spiritual leader]] or of a [[spiritual group]]. In contrast to other [[belief system]]s, religious beliefs are usually [[Codification (law)|codified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief | publisher = University of California Press | author = Wittgenstein, Ludwig | year = 2007 | pages = 53 | isbn = 0520251814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of religious belief===
A popular view holds that different religions each have identifiable and exclusive sets of beliefs or [[creed]]s, but surveys of religious belief have often found that the official doctrine and descriptions of the beliefs offered by [[religious authority|religious authorities]] do not always agree with the privately held beliefs of those who identify as members of a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An empiricist's view of the nature of religious belief | publisher = Norwood Editions  (Norwood, Pa.) | author = Braithwaite, R. B. | year = 1975 | isbn = 088305955X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a broad classification of the kinds of religious belief, see below.

====Fundamentalism====
{{Main|Religious fundamentalism}}
First self-applied as a term to the conservative doctrine outlined by anti-modernist [[Protestants]] in the United States of America,&lt;ref name="A.C. Dixon"&gt;{{cite web |date= 2012-11-27 |url = http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |title = 'The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth' |accessdate = 2012-11-28 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203144842/http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |archivedate = 3 December 2012 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "fundamentalism" in religious terms denotes strict adherence to an interpretation of scriptures that are generally associated with theologically conservative positions or traditional understandings of the text and are distrustful of innovative readings, new revelation, or alternative interpretations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Religious fundamentalism has been identified{{by whom|date=November 2017}} in the media as being associated with [[fanaticism|fanatical]] or [[zealotry|zealous]] political movements around the world that have used a strict adherence to a particular religious doctrine as a means to establish political identity and to enforce societal norms.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

====Orthodoxy====
{{Main|Orthodoxy (disambiguation)}}
First used in the context of [[Early Christianity]], the term "orthodoxy" relates to religious belief that closely follows the edicts, [[apologetics|apologies]], and [[hermeneutics]] of a prevailing religious authority. In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term "[[Magisterium]]". The term ''orthodox'' was applied{{when|date= November 2017}} almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism – now known as [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christianity and the [[Catholic Church]] each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of "orthodox" is "[[heterodox]]", and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of [[apostasy]], [[schism (religion)|schism]], or [[heresy]].

====Modernism/reform====
The [[Renaissance]] and later the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe exhibited varying degrees of [[religious tolerance]] and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The ''[[philosophe]]s'' took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Liberal Christianity]] offer two examples of such religious associations.

====Superstition====
{{Main|Superstition}}
A term signifying derogation that is used by the religious and non-religious alike, "superstition" refers to a  deprecated belief in supernatural causation. Those who deny the existence of the supernatural generally attribute all beliefs associated with it to be superstitious, while a typical religious critique of superstition holds that it either encompasses beliefs in non-existent supernatural activity or that the supernatural activity is inappropriately feared or held in improper regard (see [[idolatry]]). Christian Churches strongly condemned [[occultism]], [[animism]], [[paganism]], and other [[folk religion]]s as mean forms of superstition, though such condemnation did not necessarily eliminate the beliefs among the common people, and many such religious beliefs persist {{as of | 2018 | lc = on | alt = today}}.

====Systemization====
In Buddhism, practice and progress along the [[spiritual path]] happens when one follows the system of [[Buddhist practice]]. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system includes bad aspects too.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a "bad" religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha:
{{quote|"O Gotama, there are [[Shramana|Samana]]s (wandering monks) and [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]] (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and [[Mahavira|Nigantha Nataputta]]. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"}}

The Buddha replied:
{{quote|"Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], neither in it is there found a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|first stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Once-returner|second stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|third stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Arahant|fourth stage]]."}}

As a religious tradition, [[Hindu]]ism has experienced many attempts at systemization. In medieval times, [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] advocated for the [[Advaita]] system of philosophy. In recent times, [[Tamala Krishna Gosvami]] has researched the systemization of [[Krishna]] theology as expounded by [[Srila Prabhupada]]. (See [[Krishnology]])

====Universalism====
Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern [[Western culture|Western]] cultures do.

Some [[anthropologist]]s{{Who|date=July 2010}} report cultures in which gods are involved in every aspect of [[human condition|life]] – if a cow goes dry, a god has caused this, and must be propitiated; when the sun rises in the morning, a god has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''.

People with such a [[worldview]] often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} regard the influence of [[Western culture]] as inimical. Others with this worldview resist the influence of [[science]], and believe that science (or "so-called science") should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief, written into the constitutions of many{{which|date=November 2017}} [[Islam]]ic nations,  is shared by some [[fundamentalist Christians]].

In addition, beliefs about the [[supernatural]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as [[nature]] and non-nature, nor between science and what most educated people believe. In the view of some historians{{Who|date =September 2013}}, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] [[Athenian]]s saw [[science]], political [[tradition]], [[culture]] and religion as not easily distinguishable, but as all part of the same body of [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] available to a [[community]].

===Approaches to the beliefs of others===
Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other [[religious denomination]]s in a variety of ways.  All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

====Exclusivism====
{{See also|Exclusivism}}
People with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the [[one true faith|true faith]]. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller [[new religious movement]]s that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique [[revelation]] by the [[Founders of religious traditions|founder]]s or [[leader]]s, and considers it a matter of faith that the "correct" religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheistic religions]] have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed [[monotheism]] itself is often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} vouched{{by whom|date= November 2017}} as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.

Some exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of [[proselytization]]. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the [[Great Commission]], and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the [[Quran]]ic edict "There shall be no compulsion in religion" (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The [[Conversion to Judaism|Jewish tradition]] does not actively seek out converts.

Exclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Inclusivism====
People with [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] beliefs recognize some truth in all faith [[system]]s, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated{{by whom|date= November 2017}} with [[Interfaith dialog]]ue or with the Christian [[Ecumenical]] movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations.

Explicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the [[New Age]] movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith-systems.

====Pluralism====
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}
People with [[religious pluralism|pluralist]] beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture.  Examples include:

* Extracts from the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji (Sikh Holy Scriptures), "There is only the One Supreme Lord God; there is no other at all" (Pannaa 45). "By His Power the [[Vedas]] and the [[Purana]]s exist, and the Holy Scriptures of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions. By His Power all deliberations exist." (Pannaa 464). "Some call Him, '[[Lord Rama|Ram]], Ram', and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'. Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allaah'. ||1|| He is the Cause of causes, the Generous Lord. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us amen." (Pannaa 885).

====Syncretism====
{{Main|Syncretism}}
People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular [[experience]]s and contexts (''see'' [[eclecticism]]). [[Unitarian Universalism]] exemplifies a syncretistic faith.

===Adherence===
{{See also|Existence of God}}
Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:

* Some see belief in a deity as necessary for [[Morality|moral behavior]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Compare: {{cite web | date= 2005-03-07 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/110/13.0.html | title = Roy Moore: 'We Have No Morality Without an Acknowledgment of God' | publisher = [[Christianity Today]] | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many{{quantify|date= November 2017}} people regard religious practices as serene, beautiful, and conducive to religious experiences, which in turn support religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Miller | first = David Ian | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2005/02/15/findrelig.DTL | title = Finding My Religion: Steve Georgiou on his faith and mentor, minimalist poet Robert Lax | publisher =  SFGate | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organized religions promote a sense of [[Community (disambiguation)|community]] among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people with similar [[values]].&lt;ref name="repa"&gt;{{cite web | last = Repa | first = J. Theodore | date = 1998-10-18 | url = http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | title = Building Community: The Marriage of Religion and Education | accessdate = 2006-05-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907172411/http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | archive-date = 7 September 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, while religious beliefs and practices are usually connected, some individuals with substantially secular beliefs still participate in religious practices for cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Note for example the concept of a [[cultural Christian]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each religion asserts that it is a means by which its adherents may come into closer contact with the Divine, with Truth, and with [[spiritual power]]. They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and to bring them into spiritual freedom.  It naturally follows that a religion which can free its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental-health benefits. [[Abraham Maslow]]'s research after [[World War II]] showed that [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting that belief helped people cope in extreme circumstances. [[Humanistic psychology]] went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice.  Other factors may involve sense of [[purpose]], sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], or a sense of contact with the divine. See also ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', by [[Viktor Frankl]], detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the primary selector for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were Holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), "[m]ore longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these [religious] factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful."&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Larson | first = David B. |author2 = Susan S.

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] also summarizes a number of apparent benefits which reinforce religious belief. These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, "a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation," an increased sense of control, companionship with one's deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alcock |first1=James |authorlink1=James Alcock |title=The God Engine |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=32–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical reasons for rejection of religion include:
* Some people regard certain fundamental doctrines of some religions as illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient [[evidence]]; such people may reject one or more religions for those reasons.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;For example: {{cite web |last= Russell |first = Bertrand |authorlink = Bertrand Russell |date = 1927-03-06 |url = http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |title = Why I am Not a Christian |accessdate = 2006-05-19 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061119081311/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |archivedate = 2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They may thus disagree with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or with various [[creation myth]]s. This reason has perhaps{{original research inline|date= November 2017}} been aggravated by the protestations and empases of some [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]].
* Some religions include beliefs that certain groups of people are inferior or sinful and deserve contempt, persecution, or even death, and that non-believers will be punished for their unbelief in an [[after-life]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, some [[Muslim]]s believe that women are inferior to men. Some [[Christian]]s share this belief. At the time of the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865, many Southerners used passages from the [[Bible]] to justify race-based [[slavery]]. Certain campaigners have used the Christian religion as a reason to persecute and to deny the rights of homosexuals, on the basis that the Christian biblical God disapproves of homosexuality, and by implication of homosexuals. Compare http://www.godhatesfags.com&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to a religion may feel antipathy to unbelievers. Numerous examples exist of people of one religion or sect using religion as an excuse to murder people with different religious beliefs. To mention just a few
** the slaughter of the [[Huguenot]]s by French [[Catholics]] in the sixteenth century
** [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s killing each other when [[Pakistan]] separated from India in 1947
** the persecution and killing of [[Shiite]] Muslims by [[Sunni]] Muslims in Iraq
** the murder of [[Protestant]]s by [[Catholics]] and vice versa in [[Ireland]] (both of these examples in the late twentieth century)
** the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] that continues {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}. - According to some critics of religion, such beliefs can encourage completely unnecessary conflicts and in some cases even wars. Many [[atheist]]s believe that, because of this, religion is incompatible with world peace, freedom, civil rights, equality, and good government. On the other hand, most religions perceive atheism as a threat and will vigorously and even violently{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} defend themselves against religious sterilization, making the attempt to remove public religious practices a source of strife.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp, Philip (pseudonym of Jeremy Bentham) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=qiRQAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Natural+Religion+on+the+Temporal+Happiness+of+Mankind&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sGJSbzT4Ts&amp;sig=pzV-WU5Jx0cpsVXX08ZU17mL-BE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 ''Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind''], 1822, R. Carlile, London, at page 76: "Of all human antipathies, that which the believer in a God bears to the unbeliever is the fullest, the most unqualified, and the most universal"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some people may be unable to accept the values that a specific religion promotes and will therefore not join that religion. They may also be unable to accept the proposition that those who do not believe will go to hell or be damned, especially if said nonbelievers are close to the person.
* The maintenance of [[Human life (disambiguation)|life]] and the achievement of [[self-esteem]] require of a person the fullest exercise of reason{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}—but morality (people are taught{{by whom|date=November 2017}}) rests on and requires faith.&lt;ref&gt;Faith is the commitment of one's consciousness to beliefs for which one has no sensory evidence or rational proof. When a person rejects reason as their standard of judgment, only one alternative standard allegedly remains to them: feelings. A mystic is a person who treats feelings as tools of cognition. Faith is the equation of feeling with knowledge. To practice the "virtue" of faith, one must (we are told) be willing to suspend one's sight and one's judgment; one must be willing to live with the unintelligible, with that which cannot be conceptualized or integrated into the rest of one's knowledge, and to induce a trance like illusion of understanding. One must allegedly be willing to repress one's critical faculty and hold it as one's guilt; one must be willing to drown any questions that rise in protest—to strangle any trust of [[reason]] convulsively seeking to assert its proper function as the protector of one's life and cognitive integrity. The presumed human need for self-esteem entails the need for a sense of control over reality—but no control is possible in a universe which, by one's own concession, contains the supernatural, the miraculous and the causeless, a universe in which one is at the mercy of ghosts and demons, in which one must deal, not with the unknown, but with the unknowable; no control is possible if a person proposes, but a ghost disposes; no control is possible if the universe is a haunted house. A person's life and self-esteem require that the object and concern of his or her consciousness be reality and this earth—but morality, people are taught, consists of scorning this earth and the world available to sensory perception, and of contemplating, instead, a "different" and "higher" reality, a realm inaccessible to reason and incommunicable in language, but attainable by revelation, by special dialectical processes, by that superior state of intellectual lucidity known to Zen-Buddhists as "No-Mind," or by death. A person's life and self-esteem require that this person take pride in their power to think, pride in their power to live—but morality, people are taught, holds pride, and specifically intellectual pride, as the gravest of sins. Virtue begins, people are taught, with humility: with the recognition of the helplessness, the smallness, the impotence of one's mind. A person's life and self-esteem purportedly require the person to be loyal to their values, loyal to their mind and its judgments, loyal to their life—but the essence of morality, people are taught, consists of self-sacrifice: the sacrifice of one's mind to some higher authority, and the sacrifice of one's values to whoever may claim to require it. A sacrifice, it is necessary to remember, means the surrender of a higher value in favor of a lower value or of a nonvalue. If one gives up that which one does not value in order to obtain that which one does value—or if one gives up a lesser value in order to  obtain a greater one—this is not a sacrifice, but a gain. Remember further that all of a person's values allegedly exist in a hierarchy; people value some things more than others; and, to the extent that a person is rational, the hierarchical order of the person's values is rational: that is, the person values things in proportion to their importance in serving this person's life and well-being. That which is inimical to their life and well-being, that which is inimical to their nature and needs as a living being, the person disvalues. Conversely, one of the characteristics of mental illness is a distorted value structure; the neurotic does not value things according to their objective merit, in relation to the person's nature and needs; they frequently value the very things that will lead them to self-destruction. Judged by objective standards, they are engaged in a chronic process of self-sacrifice. But if sacrifice is a virtue, it is not the neurotic but the rational person who must be “cured”. They must learn to do violence to their own rational judgment—to reverse the order of their value hierarchy—to surrender that which their mind has chosen as the good—to turn against and invalidate their own consciousness.{{cite book

==Systems==
A '''belief system''' is a set of mutually supportive beliefs. The beliefs of any such system can be classified as [[Religious belief|religious]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[politics|political]], [[Ideology|ideological]], or a combination of these. Philosopher [[Jonathan Glover]] says that beliefs are always part of a belief system, and that tenanted belief systems are difficult for the tenants to completely revise or reject.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth A. Minton, Lynn R. Khale|title=Belief Systems, Religion, and Behavioral Economics|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=Business Expert Press LLC|isbn=978-1-60649-704-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilbert, sociological perspectives===
A collective belief is referred to when people speak of what 'we' believe when this is not simply elliptical for what 'we all' believe.

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote of collective beliefs and proposed that they, like all '[[social fact]]s', 'inhered in' social [[Group (sociology)|groups]] as opposed to individual persons. Durkheim's discussion of collective belief, though suggestive, is relatively obscure.

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Margaret Gilbert]] has offered a related account in terms of the joint commitment of a number of persons to accept a certain belief as a body. According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it themselves.  Gilbert's work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers. One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.

===Glover===
Jonathan Glover believes that he and other philosophers ought to play some role in starting dialogues between people with deeply held, opposing beliefs, especially if there is risk of violence. Glover also believes that philosophy can offer insights about beliefs that would be relevant to such dialogue.

[[File:Snipa.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Philosopher Jonathan Glover warns that belief systems are like whole boats in the water; it is extremely difficult to alter them all at once (e.g., it may be too stressful, or people may maintain their biases without realizing it).&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;]]
Glover suggests that beliefs have to be considered holistically, and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. It always implicates and relates to other beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor's assistants made a mistake, that the patient's own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; (e.g., with help from [[ad hoc hypotheses]]). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely [[Explicit memory|explicitly]] believed (e.g., some people may not realize they have racist belief systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one's beliefs on more secure foundations ([[axioms]]), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of [[René Descartes]], saying about Descartes that "[h]e starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman." To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: "Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating."&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover's final message is that if people talk about their beliefs, they may find more deep, relevant, philosophical ways in which they disagree (e.g., less obvious beliefs, or more deeply held beliefs). Glover thinks that people often manage to find agreements and consensus through philosophy. He says that at the very least, if people do not convert each other, they will hold their own beliefs more openmindedly and will be less likely to go to war over conflicting beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/10/jonathan-glover-on-systems-of-belief.html "Jonathan Glover on systems of belief", Philosophy Bites Podcast, Oct 9 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GloverBeliefs&gt;[http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts '' 'Philosophy, Beliefs, and Conflict' '', JonathanGlover.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
The British philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has described some belief systems (including belief in [[homeopathy]], [[psychic powers]], and [[alien abduction]]) as "[[wiktionary:claptrap|claptrap]]" and said that they "draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves to victory... if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again".&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Scientist]]'' (magazine), 11 June 2011 [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028160.200-a-field-guide-to-bullshit.html A field guide to bullshit | New Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
Buddhist views, although varying on a series of [[Chinese Buddhist canon|canon]]s within the three branches of [[Buddhism]] ([[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]), observe the concept of [[euthanasia]], or "mercy killing", in a denunciatory manner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umoar.mu.edu.mm/bitstream/handle/123456789/166/The%20Response%20to%20Euthanasia.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The Response to Euthanasia from the Perspective of Buddhism, Mandalay University Research Journal 3, 188-195|last=Lin|first=Saw|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods of euthanasia include [[Voluntary euthanasia|voluntary]], [[Involuntary euthanasia|involuntary]], and [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perrett RW |title=Buddhism, euthanasia and the sanctity of life |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=309–13 |date=October 1996|pmid=8910785 |pmc=1377066 |doi=10.1136/jme.22.5.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, as one school of Buddhism evolved into the next, their scriptures recorded through the oral messages of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself on Buddhist principles and values followed, guiding approximately 500 million Buddhists spanning the globe on their path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the [[Monasticism|Monastic Rule]], or [[Vinaya]], a consensus is reached by the Buddha on euthanasia and [[assisted suicide]] that expresses a lack of fondness of its practice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keown D, Keown J |title=Killing, karma and caring: euthanasia in Buddhism and Christianity |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=265–9 |date=October 1995|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/21/5/265.full.pdf |pmid=8558539 |pmc=1376772 |doi=10.1136/jme.21.5.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddhism does not confirm that life should be conserved by implementing whatever is necessary to prolong death, but instead expresses that the intentional precipitation of death is ethically inadmissible in every condition one is presented in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Vinaya ==
The Vinaya [[Tripiṭaka|Tripitaka]] is one of three Buddhist canonical sources that makes up the Tripitaka that most relates to euthanasia. It was created to encompass a series of case laws in which Buddha provided judgement on various matters, even though the term "euthanasia" is not specifically mentioned.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monks and nuns are meant to follow the decorum that is relayed, which expresses what is considered to be wrongfully killing someone (prohibited by Buddhist precepts) by the actions of another who is conferred to follow holy orders and those who are not. Outside of Vinaya, there is no specific mention in early Buddhist texts on euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the life of Buddha, instances occurred when monks who practiced medicine were put in situations where they had to make a decision to assist in another's suicide by physically taking their life, providing the instrument used to take their life, or allowing the person to suffer, as observed in cases written in Vinaya. The Buddha, therefore, included a precept in Vinaya against the termination of another human life following the discovery that monks either took their own life or requested that others kill them because they were unhappy with their body. Buddha stated that:

{{Quote|text=Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,): "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr|title=Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha (rules for male monks), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=access to insight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

With this, Buddha later expanded the precept in the third [[parajika]], adding the punishment of excommunication for life from the [[Sangha]] after recognizing a number of monks provoking a patient to believe that he should choose death over life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this instance, the monks praised the idea that death was beautiful to a sick monk, persuading him to take an unrevealed measure to end his life. Because of the monk's expression of virtue, as he was informed by other monks, he would receive a good rebirth. As a result of these provocations, the monk stopped eating and later died.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues|last=Harvey|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|year=2000|isbn=978-0-511-07584-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.295}}

== Death and karma ==
Buddhists believe that life begins at the point of birth and ends when the individual dies. Throughout the course of the individual's life, between life and death, they are to be respected with dignity, regardless of their state of mental capacity or [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] functions. What constitutes life in a body is [[Thermoregulation|usma]] (heat), [[Vitality|ayu]] (vitality), and [[Vinnana|vinanna]] (sentiency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67323-0/abstract|title=End of life: The buddhist view.

Some consider death to be when the brain loses its functionality. And there are those who disagree with this idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Buddha passed away, according to ancient texts, his 25-year personal attendant [[Ananda]] declared him as dead. However, Ananda was later corrected by a monk senior to him, claiming that Buddha was only in a severe state of yogistic stupor. During this yogic [[trance]], Buddha lacked any vital signs of life, making it unclear for future Buddhists to determine the point of death when such physiological states exist and are relayed in Buddhist literary texts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although at death one loses all physical possessions, leaving their family, loved ones, and achievements all behind, death does not destroy all that belongs to a person. The purification of their character through virtuous and meditative practices carries over into their next life and into their mental sequence of continuation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Traditional bhavachakra wall mural of Yama holding the wheel of life, Buddha pointing the way out.jpg|thumb|[[Yama]], Lord of Death, holding the [[Bhavacakra|Bhavachakra]] or Wheel of Life]]Buddhists hold the belief that upon death, they are reborn and will experience life through a series of lifetimes called [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] until they can cease to desire and nirvana is obtained. In conjunction with a person's previously attained karma, their state of mind at the point of death holds great importance when the determining of what kind of rebirth is to take place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are six realms of life in Buddhist cosmology: Hell realm ([[Naraka]]), hungry ghost ([[Preta]]) realm, animal realm ([[Animals in Buddhism|Tiracchānayoni]]), human realm ([[Human beings in Buddhism|Manussa]]), demi-god realm ([[Asura]]), and god realm ([[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lecso PA |title=Euthanasia: a Buddhist perspective |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=1986|pmid=11651853 |doi=10.1007/BF01533053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the realms that exist, the human realm is the most anticipated, yet the most difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the level of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] one garners in their current lifetime, it is determined at which realm one diverges to next upon death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first three realms (Hell realm, hungry ghost realm, and animal realm) are the most detested of the six and are meant to cause suffering, disallowing proper mental capabilities as a result of negative karma from negative acts performed during the previous life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And although more acceptable than the former, the asura and god realm remain unfavorable as they permit one ultimate happiness but prevents the opportunity for the spirit to progress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only through good karma can one's spirit reach the human realm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Euthanasia, although it can be considered a compassionate act, is not seen in Buddhism as an act of selflessness and benevolence, but rather an act of  damage masked as help, which in turn can result in negative karma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If someone is suffering as a result of sickness, it could be a result of karma, and ending their life is not likely to end their adversity, as the suffering caused by karma will only follow them after death until its energy concludes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Compassion]] ([[karuṇā]]) is a Buddhist value that reinforces how Buddhism views standards in medicine, which is observed in all three schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|p.295}} Although it can be seen as morally good, committing an act through compassion is not always justified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking a life out of compassion to mitigate the affliction one experiences through illness or injury is an instance in which a person may feel he or she is vindicated to exploit euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Buddhism and the [[Bodhisattva]], it can create incongruities through the infringement of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of an unjustified act of compassion is a case written in the Vinaya, where a convicted man is hastily executed after a monk requests the executioner to do so, as to not prolong his suffering and the sorrowful period he has to wait.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A morally good scenario of compassion would be if a patient in a hospital in his or her right mind feels that their ailment is using too much of a valuable resource in limited quantities, or causing their family to spend large sums of money that is not readily available on medical bills to keep them alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Out of morally good compassion, he or she might decide to cease the sources of life preservation without pressure from others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Had those associations been pressuring the patient to forgo further life saving treatment, this could be observed as murderous.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If the patient were terminally ill and unable to eat on their own accord, it would be a requirement of his or her associations to assist them, even if intravenous feeding was necessary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism paints life in a way that is fundamentally valuable, and it should never be surrendered for any reason, whether compassion, amity, or anything of value.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It would be an ill-advised way to show compassion rooted in misconception to endorse death using compassion as the reasoning.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vegetative state ==
According to Buddhist precepts, someone who is in a [[vegetative state]] is neither dead nor alive, but instead is said to be in some form of obscure state of mind and still a living individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They lack the necessity to rely on outside assistance to support their ability to stay alive other than being supplemented with nutrients to keep them functioning for a significant number of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this, Buddhism sees someone in a vegetative state as a living, breathing life form, because the value in which one's life holds is not observed through individualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Buddhism views this state of being as damaged, the individual should be treated no different than before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both animals and humans, prior to their birth as they await in the mother's womb, have value and therefore should not have their life taken from them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, some Buddhists are under the impression that an unconscious life, or one that lacks awareness, does not have value, which is highly debatable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism shows that even with a damaged physical organ, such as the brain, someone is still deserving of compassion because they are still capable of causing varying emotions in someone who cares for them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To end a life because of a patient's state of mind and to deny them treatment would be an act of abandonment, which would be considered irrational and unfair because Buddhists have a strong belief in compassion for all living things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A vegetative state can be considered a varied form of meditation where the sentience of someone acts in a way not ordinary to what is regularly observed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another form of consciousness where the body does not react is that of "formless" rebirths.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Due to these meditative states, it is often difficult to determine in a physical manner a state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The state of consciousness, at the time, may be experiencing a demonstration of going through the processes of death in ultimate preparation so that once death does come, it can receive the best form of rebirth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this process of preparation, the eyes and other sense-organs will cease to function, but the person's sense of touch, brain function, and life force lie in the heart.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, considering the conception of meditative states, some in a vegetative state are therefore still sentient.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Being in a continuous state of vegetation is not the same as the process by which one prepares for death, even though it does resemble it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The possibility exists for one to lack the function to breathe and think, but still be alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Alternatives to euthanasia ==
[[File:San Francisco Zen Center.jpg|thumb|The San Francisco Zen Center]]
Moving someone who is terminally ill into [[hospice care]] to help mitigate physical pain with [[Analgesic|pain relievers]] that is not intended to end their life, allowing them to pass away painless and comfortable, is a highly considerable alternative to euthanasia. Hospice care is meant to assist a person to have, what is called a "good death."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When one nears death, they should be able to reflect on their life peacefully. Since 1971, the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] has offered assistance to terminally ill patients, with trained hospice employees since the inception of a hospice training program in 1987. The Buddhist Hospice Trust in the United Kingdom has been an alternative to this center since its founding in 1987. Not only does it provide volunteers to visit those nearing death, but it provides an avenue for those who lost someone they cared about to receive counsel and sympathy and is also used as a center into researching death and mourning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The purpose of such a center is to truly alleviate any amount of anxiety one could experience when approaching death, leaving known loved ones behind, and to ensure a clear and calm state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hospice care employees therefore prefer not to allow a person to die in an anesthetized, unconscious state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A positive transition to a future life is best obtained when one dies with a clear conscience, free of anger, dissent, and anxiety, and in a relaxed state of being.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, a "good death" is facilitated by family and friends, who do their best to ensure the dying person is untroubled and uplifted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''The Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation''' or '''CJCUC''' is an educational institution at which Christians who tour Israel can study the [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and learn about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. The center was established in [[Efrat]] in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. [[Shlomo Riskin]], who has been described as "the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists".&lt;ref name=jesus&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14755610.2011.633537|title=The Messiah and Rabbi Jesus: Policing the Jewish–Christian border in Christian Zionism|journal=Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal|first=Faydra L.|last=Shapiro|year=2012|volume=12|issue=4|pages=463–477|doi=10.1080/14755610.2011.633537}}&lt;/ref&gt; CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as [[Christians United for Israel]] and the [[International Christian Embassy Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=jesus/&gt;

== History ==
The ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, [[Shlomo Riskin]], published an essay entitled "Confrontation"&lt;ref&gt;''Confrontation'', Tradition 6:2 p5-9, 1964. Reprinted in "A Treasury of Tradition", Hebrew Publishing Co, NY, 1967. – {{OCLC|1974913}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary.

At around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the Catholic Church, and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, [[The Holy See]] issued ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. ''Nostra aetate'' absolved the Jews from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people.

Riskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor [[David Flusser]], about the Christian Gospels at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]]. He formed relations with Rev. Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings and with Pastor [[John Hagee]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shabbat-gadol"&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=https://musaf-shabbat.com/2012/05/17/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94/|title=Jewish–Christian Dialogue: Rethinking|first=Zur|last=Erlich|publisher=[[Makor Rishon]]|date=17 May 2012|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

of biblical sites such as nearby [[Jerusalem]], the Path of the Patriarchs and the Herodian wells.
Among the subjects that the seminar series includes are Jewish–Christian Relations; the Theology
of Biblical Holidays; Covenant and Mission; [[The Ten Commandments]]; Satan, Evil and Free Will;
[[Judaism]] and the Ministry of Jesus; and Human Life Created in the Image of God.

The center runs educational seminars for students and faculty of Catholic and Protestant seminaries in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It has appointed North American and European directors to coordinate relations with religious leaders on these continents.

CJCUC has established a Theological Think Tank, the Institute for Theological Inquiry (ITI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/890647512.html "CJCUC Announces the Publication of Covenant &amp; Hope"] – standardnewswire.com – 10 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Rabbi [[Eugene Korn]] and Dr. [[Robert Jenson]] of the [[Witherspoon Institute]], which consists of international scholars and theologians whose tasks are to clarify areas of Jewish and Christian theological agreement and disagreement,&lt;ref&gt;''Covenant and Hope – Christian and Jewish Reflections'' – Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. – July 2012 – {{ISBN|978-0802867049}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as identify areas of fruitful cooperation. The topics focus on past and present Jewish–Christian Relations, [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]], [[Salvation]], Biblical Hermeneutics, Religion and Violence, [[Ethical Monotheism]], and
[[Messianism]].

In May 2011, CJCUC facilitated and sponsored a [[Yale University]] student group consisting of Orthodox Jewish and [[Evangelical Christians]] to learn the fundamentals of Jewish–Christian relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebraiccenter.org/portal/web/guest/covenant_and_witness|title=HHCC Makes Statement on Christian-Jewish Relations|publisher=Hebraic Heritage Christian Center|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011065122/http://hebraiccenter.org/portal/web/guest/covenant_and_witness#|archive-date=11 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, CJCUC took Latin American priests and rabbis to learn the fundamentals of Jewish-Catholic relations in the backdrop of the Holy Land.&lt;ref name=wjc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Metro/Features/Priestly-blessings|title=Latin American Catholics and Jews share a trip to the Holy Land to bridge gaps|first=Deborah|last=Danan|date=3 March 2012|accessdate=23 October 2014|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, CJCUC partnered with Christians United for Israel to bring 30 Evangelical pastors from the U.S. to learn the fundamentals of Jewish–Christian relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765586635/Jews-and-Christian-Evangelicals-work-to-improve-communication.html|title=Jews and Christian Evangelicals work to improve communication|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013223952/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765586635/Jews-and-Christian-Evangelicals-work-to-improve-communication.html#|archive-date=13 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, CJCUC co-sponsored the visit of more than 160 pastors to Israel through the [[Christians United for Israel]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cufi.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=12351|title=CUFI Takes More than 160 Pastors to Israel (press release)|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=23 October 2014|publisher=[[Christians United for Israel]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211748/http://www.cufi.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=12351#|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, CJCUC founder, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin along with CJCUC's Executive Director, David Nekrutman, addressed a group of 400 pastors and rabbis at a symposium held in Broward County, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/broward/fl-jjbs-rabbi-0129-20150126-story.html|title=Riskin: Interfaith dialogue critical|first=Marvin|last=Glassman|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=28 January 2015|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, on a visit to Oklahoma, Rabbi Riskin unveiled plans for historic high school curricula, being worked on in a joint effort with the government of Israel, detailing advancements in Jewish–Christian relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://city-sentinel.com/2015/02/rabbi-riskin-historic-curriculum/|title=Rabbi Riskin announces historic curriculum for Israeli schools during visit to Oklahoma|first=Darla|last=Shelden|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=City-Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, CJCUC announced that it was moving its center of operations from [[Efrat]] to the [[Bible Lands Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/6802578149.html|title=The Land of the Bible Meets the Word of the Bible|website=Christian Newswire|date=14 July 2016|access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en|url=http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=68fbc11d9f14b345f72e71461&amp;id=0cd33a9201|title=CJCUC is Moving to Jerusalem|website=[[MailChimp]]|date=14 July 2016|access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CJCUC has received funds from Israel's Hertog family, [[Paul Singer (businessman)|Paul Singer]] Foundation, Zion's Gate International Foundation, [[Justice Ministry (Israel)|Ministry of Justice]], and [[John Hagee]] Ministries.

In contrast with worship of a [[Creator deity]], the theological term '''creature worship''' refers unflatteringly to veneration of that which is created. In the biblical worldview, creature worship is seen as analogous to a reversal of the relationship between God and creature or the reversal of mindedness, which places power in the handiwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unceasing Worship: Biblical Perspectives on Worship and the Arts|last=Best|first=Harold|publisher=IVP Books|year=2003|isbn=9780830832293|location=Downers Groove, Illinois|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Creature worship may include: [[Animal worship]], [[Animism]],[[Cult of personality]],[[Household deity]], [[Idolatry]], [[Nature worship]], and/or [[Pantheism]].

In some Christian denominations and even in the early development of the Christian church, the veneration of saints is considered creature worship. It is based on the view that Christians worship the deity of God instead of his humanity and that all creature worship, including the bowing and reverence for any creature such as the [[Marian devotions|veneration of Mary]] and the saints are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Foundations of Social Order: Studies in the Creeds and Councils of the Early Church|last=Rushdoony|first=Rousas John|publisher=Chalcedon Foundation|year=2009|isbn=1879998122|location=Vallecito, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Buddhism]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was said to have forbidden his disciples from worshiping his images. To get around this, some Buddhists worship objects that serve as his symbols such as the [[Ficus religiosa|''pipal'' tree]], images of Buddha's footsteps, and the wheel of law, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gautam Buddha (The Spiritual Light Of Asia)|last=Mathur|first=Suresh Narain|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|year=2005|isbn=8189182706|location=New Delhi|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Creature worship is part of the Hindu faith and this is based on the theory of karma and the principle of rebirth. With the goal to achieve [[Nirvana|''nirvana'']], the soul experiences rebirth in the form of different creatures. It is, thus, accepted to worship nature in all of its elements because it signifies respect for the environment as well as the worship for one's ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=RSS 360 °: Demystifying Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|last=Sharda|first=Ratan|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9789386950383|location=New Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] has had many critics, who have from time to time found fault with many of its teachings and precepts, discovered apparent contradictions and inconsistencies in its history, and even raised controversial questions about specific policies and actions of past and existing administrative bodies.

In recent times, some of the more common of these criticisms have been compiled in books and blogs. Many Bahá'í authors have also given their own responses to these criticisms.

==Criticism of Bahá'í teachings==

===Unity of religion===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
[[File: 4_Abrahamic_symbols.png|200px|thumbnail|left|Clockwise: [[Christian cross]], Islamic [[Star and crescent|star &amp; crescent]], Bahá'í nine-pointed star, and Jewish [[Star of David]]]]
A core teaching of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the unity of all the world's religions; They believe that the teachings of all the major religions are components of a single plan which is directed by the same [[God]], yet that religion is cyclical in nature and becomes corrupted with time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahaiteachings.org/bahai-principles-one-foundation-for-all-religions Article demonstrating unity of religion belief.]&lt;/ref&gt; The religions that the Bahá'í Faith claims to be congruent appear to have contradictory teachings. For instance, their attitude toward the Abrahamic prophets (Moses, Jesus, Muhammad) and the way in which followers partake in worship vary significantly among the major religions, and social laws and attitudes vary between traditions.

The principle of [[universalism]] itself has many opponents, such as Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]], who claims that it not only demeans local and national traditions but also encourages widespread religious supremacy. Sacks disputes the principle of universalism on the grounds that there may not be just one truth about the essentials of the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Jonathan |title=The Dignity of Difference |date=2002 |publisher=Continuum |isbn=9780826468505 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í authors have tried to refute the criticism by claiming to promote unity in diversity.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=139}}

Anthropologist Fiona Bowie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bowie |first=Fiona |date=2000 |title=The anthropology of religion. The Blackwell companion to the study of religion |page=4 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and author on comparative religion [[Karen Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first=Karen |date=1994 |title=A history of God |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that religious ideas cannot be unified because they evolve out of primitive beliefs in [[animism]] and [[idolatry]], ideas at odds with [[monotheism]]. Armstrong says that idol worship predates monotheism, raising the question of whether the Bahá'í ideal of unity of religion can extend to ancient beliefs and practices.

[[Christians]] have been known to dismiss the Bahá'í Faith as a [[syncretism|syncretic]] combination of faiths&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2014/june/avoiding-pitfall-of-syncretism.html Christian website referring to Bahá'í Faith as syncretic]&lt;/ref&gt; or point to discrepancies between faiths to contradict the idea of unity of religion.{{sfn|Ankerberg|1999}} The Christian doctrine of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] is commonly understood to exclude all other religions as a path to God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equip.org/perspectives/universalism-dont-all-religions-lead-to-god/ Article from Christian Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Bahá'í teachings of peace and unity, [[Edward Granville Browne|Professor Browne]] argued that whilst they are admirable, they are, in his opinion, inferior to the simplicity and beauty of the teachings of Christ. He further argued that in the case of "Baha'ism, with its rather vague doctrines as to the nature and destiny of the soul of man, it is a little difficult to see whence the driving force to enforce the ethical maxims can be derived."{{sfn|Miller|1974|p=163}}

Christian apologist [[Francis J. Beckwith]] wrote of the Bahá'í teachings:
{{quote|The fact that the various alleged manifestations of God represented God in contradictory ways implies either that manifestations of God can contradict one another or that God’s own nature is contradictory. If manifestations are allowed to contradict one another, then there is no way to separate false manifestations from true ones or to discover if any of them really speak for the true and living God…. If, on the other hand, God’s own nature is said to be contradictory, that is, that God is both one God and many gods, that God is both able and not able to have a son, personal and impersonal, etc., then the Baha’i concept of God is reduced to meaninglessness.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Research Journal, Winter/Spring, 1989, p. 2. Quoted in {{sfn|Ankerberg|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bahá'í authors have attempted to address this criticism by claiming that the contradictory teachings are either social laws that change from age to age, or human error introduced to the more ancient faiths over time.{{sfn|Stockman|1997}}{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=274-275}}

Strict Muslim theology regards Muhammad as the last messenger that God has sent and Islam as the final religion for all humankind. In this view, it is impossible for either any prophet after Muhammad or any new religion to come into existence, and thus they reject the Bahá'í Faith.{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|2002|p=221}} Some Muslims claim that the idea of oneness of humanity is not a new principle; They claim that [[Universalism#Islam|Islam espouses such a principle]].{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|page=65}} Fanatical Shīʿites have been known to picture the faith as a "heresy" or "a political movement".{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|2002|pp=221-224}} Many Islamic scholars reject all prophets after [[Muhammad]], and regard Bahá'ís as apostates if they had been Muslims before conversion.{{sfn|A.V.|2017}} Critics also argue that, despite the Bahá'í Faith's claim of unity, there are numerous theological differences between Islam and the Bahá'í Faith,{{sfn|Ankerberg|1999}} with one critic, Imran Shaykh, arguing that the disparities are evidence to the Bahá'í Faith not being a natural progression of Islam, as is claimed.{{sfn|Shaykh|2010}}

===Gender equality===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and gender equality}}
Whilst Bahá'í teachings assert that men and women are spiritually equal, author Lil Abdo says that the Bahá'í understanding of sexual equality is different from that of secular feminists. Abdo presented the following list of criticisms of the Bahá'í Faith from a feminist perspective at an annual gathering for Bahá'í studies in 1995:

{{quote|the ineligibility of women to serve on the Universal House of Justice--this is of particular interest to supporters of women priests within the Christian tradition; the intestacy laws in the Kitab-i-Aqdas; the dowry laws with particular reference to the virginity refund clause; the exemption of menstruating women from obligatory prayers and the implication of menstrual taboo; the exemption of women from pilgrimage; the use of androcentric language and male pronouns in texts; the emphasis on traditional morality and family values...{{sfn|Abdo|1995}} }}

Quoting `Abdu’l-Bahā, Iranian critics claim he saw women as inferior to men. According to these critics, `Abdu’l-Bahā said: "Although women and men share the same capacities and abilities, there is definitely no doubt that men are superior and stronger.  Even  in  animals  like  pigeons,  sparrows,  peacocks,  and  other [birds]  this  advantage  is  visible,"{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|pp=324-325}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Badā’i` al-āthār|author=Maḥmūd Zaraqani|volume=1|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu’l-Bahā made the comments in light of being questioned as to why God didn't send any female prophets.

Azadeh Haiati claims that whilst "official statements from the Baha'i administration seemingly promote gender equality and the ideal of justice and equity in the world at large, Baha'i women themselves are treated with injustice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fallacy of Gender Equality in The Bahai Faith|author=Azadeh Haiati|url=http://www.bahaiawareness.com/bahai12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Cole notes that in 1988 the all-male House of Justice "permanently suppressed" an academic paper that was arguing for women to be able to serve in the UHJ. He says they insisted only men could serve.{{sfn|Cole|1998}}

Some critics have claimed that Bahá'í leaders have tried to portray themselves as women's rights advocates in order to make their religion more appealing to modern society.
{{quote|"By expressing sympathy for women - especially the women in Iran - [[Shoghi Effendi|Shoghi]] tries to portray Baha'ism as a creed with equal rights for the genders. When the Baha'i teachings are more closely analysed, it is apparent that there is no equality in rights, rather, there is a great inclination towards men."{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|p=464}}}}

===Science===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and science}}
According to [[Shoghi Effendi]], the harmony between science and religion is an important Bahá'í principle.{{sfn|Effendi|1944|pp=281–282}} However, there is tension over this principle due to several instances of Bahá'í scriptures disagreeing with current scientific knowledge. Prominent among them are references by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] that humans evolved over a long period, but were never animals. Many Bahá'í authors have commented&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Anjam Khursheed (1987). Science and Religion: Towards the Restoration of an Ancient Harmony; Craig Loehle (1990). [https://bahai-studies.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2.4-Loehle.pdf On Human Origins: A Bahá’í Perspective]. Journal of Baha’i Studies 2(4); Gary Matthews (1993). The Challenge of Baha’u’llah; Craig Loehle (1994). On the Shoulders of Giants; Eberhard von Kitzing (1997). [https://bahai-library.com/kitzing_bahai_view_evolution Is the Bahá'í view of evolution compatible with modern science?] Baha’i Studies Review 7; Keven Brown (2001). [http://bahai-library.com/?file=brown_evolution_bahai_belief Evolution and Bahá'í Belief: 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Response to Nineteenth-Century Darwinism]; Fariborz Alan Davoodi (2001).

[http://bahai-library.com/oskooi_disharmony_science_religion When Science and Religion Merge:A Modern Case Study].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientifically controversial ideas from [[Bahá'u'lláh]] include that the universe is [[Bahá'í Faith and science#Creation|without beginning or end]], that [[Bahá'í Faith and science#Life on other planets|every planet has "creatures"]], and that [[Bahá'í Faith and science#Transmutation of elements|copper can turn into gold]].

Critics claim Bahá'u'lláh said that every star has planets, and that every planet has its own creatures. They claim that science has already "proven the falsity of this claim".{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|p=178}} In response, a Baha'i apologist by the name of Gary L. Mathews argued that Bahá'u'lláh's teachings explicitly stated that minerals are endowed with life. He further quotes a teaching of Bahá'u'lláh and a teaching of `Abdu'l-Bahá saying this. `Abdu'l-Bahá says this is even said in the Quran, where it supposedly says "All things are living".{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|pp=178-179}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mathews|first=Gary|title=The Challenge of Bahá'u'lláh: Does God Still Speak to Humanity Today|publisher=George Ronald Pub Ltd.|date=2001|page=86|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics however point out that this is a misquote of the Quran, which actually says, '''We made '''from water''' everything living .'''&lt;ref&gt;Quran 21:30&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|p=179}} The critics further argue that in addition to this misquotation of the Quran, Mathews leaves out a part of the original quote which they argue has `Abdu'l-Bahá claim that materialists agree that every star has planets and that every planet has life. The critics summarise this by saying, "As if distorting the Quran wasn't enough `Abdu'l-Bahá puts the burden of his lies upon the materialists".{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|p=180}}

===Claims of Divinity===
{{See|Manifestation of God}}
According to critics, [[Bahá'u'lláh]] claimed [[Apotheosis|to be God]]. [[William McElwee Miller|William Miller]] says that the wording of the [[Aqdas]] made it difficult to distinguish between the words of the author ([[Bahá'u'lláh]]) and the words of God. He further opines that "[[Bahá'u'lláh]] felt no such distinction was necessary" and that "[[Bahá'u'lláh]] claims to be not merely a human Messenger of God, but a Divine Manifestation".&lt;ref&gt;Elder, E.E., Miller, W.M. and Miller, W.M. eds., 1961. Al-Kitab Al-Aqdas Or the Most Holy Book (Vol. 38). Psychology Press. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Wilson writes that the fundamental assertion of the Bahá'í Faith is that Bahá'u'lláh is the incarnation of "God the Father". He further quotes `Abdu'l-Bahá saying, "Thanks to Baha Ullah, {{sic}} we arrived safely in Liverpool."{{sfn|Wilson|2018}} This supposed claim of divinity has been criticised by Imran Shaykh who points to this as an example of a discrepancy between faiths.{{sfn|Shaykh|2010}}

==Criticism based on historical events==
{{Expand section|small=no|date=June 2018}}
===Attitude towards Black Africans===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The Bahá'í Faith espouses the need to abolish racial prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, William S., and James Douglas Martin. The Baha'i faith: The emerging global religion. Baha'i Publishing Trust, 2002. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have claimed that comments made by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] are contrary to this principle, and show racial prejudice against Black Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Iranian |date=5 January 2009 |title=‘Abdul Baha Says about Africans |url=https://iranian.com/2009/01/05/abdul-baha-says-about-africans}};&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Twelve Principles'' (2014) `Abdu'l-Bahá is quoted as saying that Africans are "cows" with "human faces".{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|pp=70-71}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=`Abdu’l-Bahā|title=Khaṭābāt|location=Tehran|volume=3|page=48|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition he is further quoted as saying: "The [black Africans] are like animals in human form. The [black Americans] are civilized, intelligent, and have culture. [...] what difference is there between these two types of blacks other than nurture, with one in utter ignorance and the other completely civilized?"{{sfn|Basiti|Moradi|Akhoondali|2014|pp=69-70}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=`Abdu’l-Bahā|title=Makātīb|location=Egypt|volume=1|page=331|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to this, a Bahá'í blogger (Sen McGlinn) claims to directly address the criticism by arguing that the racist references are examples of `Abdu'l-Bahá describing the opinions of others and that with the context of surrounding text `Abdu'l-Bahá does not appear racist and that the writings in question are using Africans as an example of humans "in a state of nature" that can be improved through education.{{sfn|McGlinn|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography of Sen McGlinn|url=https://bahai-library.com/author/Sen+McGlinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family of Bahá'u'lláh===
{{See|Bahá'u'lláh's family#Plurality of wives|Bahá'u'lláh's family}}
Although [[polygamy]] is forbidden by Bahá'í law, Bahá'u'lláh himself had three concurrent wives.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=273-274}}

===Bahá'í Faith and slavery===
{{See|Bahá'í Faith and slavery}}
Bahá'u'lláh very specifically abolished the slave trade among his followers in 1874, but the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]] were raised in households that included slaves and, according to Abu'l Qasim, they owned slaves in adulthood too.&lt;ref&gt;Afnan, Abuʾl-Qasim. Black Pearls: Servants in the Household of the Báb and Baháʾuʾlláh. Kalimat Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babi split===
{{See|Bahá'í/Bábí split}}
The Bahá'í Faith identifies itself as the fulfillment of the Bábí Faith. The separation of the two began in 1863 and was accompanied by conflict and murders.{{sfn|Miller|1974|pp=70-87}}

===Guardianship===
{{See|Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)}}
The Bahá'í scriptures intend for a line of Guardians appointed by their predecessor - the Kitáb-i-Aqdas states that all Bahá'ís must leave a will, however [[Shoghi Effendi]] (the first guardian) broke this law and left no provision for the future administration and guidance of the faith. Due to the first Guardian leaving no appointment, the line ended.{{sfn|Miller|1974|p=316}}

===Divisions===
{{See|Bahá'í divisions}}
Although the Faith emphasizes its own unity, the Bahá'í Faith has had several challenges to leadership, resulting in the formation of breakaway factions.  Claimants challenging the widely accepted successions of leadership are shunned by the majority group as [[Covenant breaker|Covenant-Breakers]].{{sfn|Miller|1974|pp=184-185}} By the time of Shoghi Effendis passing, almost every member of Bahaullahs family had been expelled from the faith.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pages = 63–64}}

==Criticism of leadership==
===Politics===
{{See|Political accusations against the Baha'i Faith}}
Bahá'ís have been accused, particularly by successive Iranian governments, of being agents or spies of Russia, Britain, the Shah, the United States, and as agents of [[Zionism]]—each claim being linked to each regime's relevant enemy and justifying anti-Bahá'í actions. The last claim is partially rooted in the presence of the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in northern Israel.{{sfn|A.V.|2017}}

===Statistics===
{{See|Bahá'í statistics}}
There has been criticism of the Bahá'í Faith that has centered on what critics see as exaggerated statements concerning numbers of believers.{{sfn|Cole|1998}}

===Bahá'í review===
[[File:Censored section of Green Illusions by Ozzie Zehner.jpg|thumb|right|Critics class the Bahá'í review process as a form of censorship.]]
{{See|Bahá'í review}}
Bahá'ís wishing to publish books about the Bahá'í Faith must first submit their work to their respective [[National Spiritual Assembly]] for approval through a review process. This process has had critics, some of whom have characterized this requirement as a form of [[censorship]].{{sfn|Momen|2007}}

Juan Cole refers to this process as "mandatory prepublication censorship" of everything Bahá'ís publish about their religion. He argues that Bahá'í leaders employ control mechanisms to "shape the speech and behavior of Bahá'ís". Furthermore, he says that when a group of editors proposed their idea of discontinuing censorship and having term limits for N.S.A. members, the N.S.A.'s response was to accuse the editors of engaging in "negative campaigning". The editors were then publicly denounced and  interrogated by assembly members, who privately expressed concerns that the publication of such a document might have prevented the current members from being reelected. According to Cole, the censorship instituted by the Bahá'í Faith has led to "intellectually acute Bahá'í literature, to a lack of indepedent magazines and to the withdrawal of a number of Bahá'í writers." He states that writers who publicly disagree with the policies of the Bahá'í institutions risk having their voting rights removed, being declared non-members and, the most serious sanction of all, being declared a "covenant breaker".{{sfn|Cole|1998}}

===Rejection of academic liberals===
[[Juan Cole]] was an American academic who resigned from membership in the Bahá'í Faith in 1996 after conflict with members of the Bahá'í administration, who perceived him as extreme and threatened him with a Bahá'í version of excommunication. Cole went on to critically attack the Bahá'í Faith in several books and articles written from 1998-2002, describing a prominent Bahá'í as an "inquisitor" and "bigot", and describing Bahá'í institutions as socially isolating, dictatorial, and controlling, with financial irregularities and sexual deviance.{{sfn|Momen|2007}} Soon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called H-Bahai, which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/ |title=H-Bahai Website |publisher=H-net.org |date =  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Report on the H-Bahai Digital Library| author=Cole, Juan R. I. | journal=[[Iranian Studies (journal)|Iranian Studies]] | date=Winter–Summer 2002 | volume=35 | issue=1 | pages=191–196 | jstor=4311442 | doi=10.1080/00210860208702016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he wrote in 2002:

{{quote|... the Baha'i faith in the United States has become more fundamentalist in the past four decades. [There are] trends toward an increasing emphasis on doctrinal and behavioral conformity, resulting in greater exclusivism and sectarianism in what on the surface appears to be a liberal and universalistic tradition... Baha'i fundamentalists see the civil state and academic scholarship on religion as their negative counterparts... fundamentalist Baha'is have become powerful in some key sectors of the Baha'i administration and employ their authority to exclude Baha'i liberals. In some recent instances, Baha'i liberals have simply been dropped from the membership rolls with no formal procedure.{{sfn|Cole|2002}} }}

A '''declaration of faith''' is a phrase that is said by a member of any [[religion]] to show either to themselves, their [[God]] or other members of the religion their belief and faith in the religion. Notable declarations of faith include the [[Sign of the Cross]] in [[Christianity]], the [[Shahadah]] in [[Islam]] and the [[Shema Yisrael]] in [[Judaism]].

There are numerous other declarations of faith, typically performed during religious rituals in many faiths. Often, the declaration of faith is led by the leader of the congregation and followers respond in kind.

'''Desecration''' is the act of depriving something of its sacred character, or the disrespectful, contemptuous, or destructive treatment of that which is held to be sacred or holy by a group or individual.

==Detail==
Many consider acts of desecration to be [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]] acts. This can include desecration of sacred books, sacred places or sacred objects. Desecration generally may be considered from the perspective of a particular religion or spiritual activity. Desecration may be applied to natural systems or components, particularly if those systems are part of naturalistic spiritual religion.

To respectfully remove the sacred character of a place or an object is [[deconsecration]], and is distinct from desecration.

Some religions, such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] have specific rules as to what constitutes desecration and what should be done in these circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-02-17|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04748c.htm|title=Desecration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Christianization of the Roman Empire===
Examples of the destruction of pagan temples in the late fourth century, as recorded in surviving texts, describe [[Martin of Tours]]' attacks on holy sites in [[Gaul]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~eknuth/npnf2-11/sulpitiu/lifeofst.html#14 Life of St. Martin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of temples in [[Syria]] by [[Marcellus of Ancyra|Marcellus]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]], "''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''", ch28&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of temples and images in, and surrounding, [[Carthage]],&lt;ref name="ramsey"&gt;R. MacMullen, "''Christianizing The Roman Empire A.D.&amp;nbsp;100&amp;ndash;400'', Yale University Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-300-03642-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Patriarch Theophilus]] who seized and destroyed pagan temples in [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;"''Theophilus''", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1912, New Advent Web Site.&lt;/ref&gt; the levelling of all the temples in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and the wider destruction of holy sites that spread rapidly throughout [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt; This is supplemented in abundance by archaeological evidence in the northern provinces exposing broken and burnt out buildings and hastily buried objects of piety.&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt; The leader of the Egyptian monks who participated in the sack of temples replied to the victims who demanded back their sacred icons:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"I peacefully removed your gods...there is no such thing as robbery for those who truly possess Christ.''"&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the turn of the century [[St Augustine]] would exhort his congregation in [[Carthage]] to smash all tangible symbols of paganism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"for that all superstition of pagans and heathens should be annihilated is what God wants, God commands, God proclaims!"''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the year 407 a decree was issued to the west from Rome: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''If any images stand even now in the temples and shrines...., they shall be torn from their foundations...The temples situated in cities or towns shall be taken for public use. Altars shall be destroyed in all places."''&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sacred sites were now appropriated by Christianity: "''Let altars be built and relics be placed there''" wrote [[Pope Gregory I]], "''so that [the pagans] have to change from the worship of the daemones to that of the true God''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramsay MacMullen]], "''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries''", Yale University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Red Terror in Spain ===

The [[Red Terror in Spain]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] involved massive desecration of churches, synagogues and other sacred objects and places by leftists.

In [[religion]], '''divinity''' or '''godhead''' is the state of things that are believed to come from a [[supernatural power]] or [[deity]], such as a [[god]], supreme being, [[creator deity]], or [[spirit]]s, and are therefore regarded as [[sacred]] and [[holy]].&lt;ref name="wiktionary"&gt;Wiktionary: "divine (comparative more divine, superlative most divine)
1) of or pertaining to a god
2) eternal, holy, or otherwise supernatural
3) of superhuman or surpassing excellence
4) beautiful, heavenly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/divine divine] - Dictionary.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/divine divine] - Merriam Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such things are regarded as divine due to their [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] origins or because their attributes or qualities are superior or supreme relative to things of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=wiktionary/&gt; Divine things are regarded as [[eternity|eternal]] and based in [[truth]],&lt;ref name=wiktionary/&gt; while material things are regarded as [[ephemeral]] and based in [[illusion]]. Such things that may qualify as divine are [[apparitional experience|apparitions]], [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]s, [[prophecy|prophecies]], [[miracle]]s, and in some views also the [[soul]], or more general things like [[resurrection]], [[immortality]], [[divine grace|grace]], and [[salvation]]. Otherwise what is or is not divine may be loosely defined, as it is used by different [[belief system]]s.

The root of the word "divine" is literally "godly" (from the Latin ''deus'', cf. ''[[Dyaus Pita|Dyaus]]'', closely related to Greek ''[[zeus]]'', ''[[Daeva|div]]'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] and ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]), but the use varies significantly depending on which deity is being discussed. This article outlines the major distinctions in the [[conventional]] use of the terms.

For specific related [[academic]] terms, see [[Divinity (academic discipline)]], or [[Anglican divine|Divine (Anglican)]].

== Usages ==
Divinity as a quality has two distinct usages:
* [[#Divine force or power|Divine force or power]] - powers or forces that are universal, or transcend human capacities
* [[#Mortals|Divinity applied to mortals]] - qualities of individuals who are considered to have some special access or relationship to the divine.
Overlap occurs between these usages because [[deities]] or godly entities are often identical with or identified by the powers and forces that are credited to them&amp;nbsp;— in many cases a deity is merely a power or force personified&amp;nbsp;— and these powers and forces may then be extended or granted to [[Human|mortal]] individuals. For instance, [[Jehovah]] is closely associated with storms and thunder throughout much of the [[Old Testament]]. He is said to speak in thunder, and thunder is seen as a token of his anger. This power was then extended to [[Prophets in Judaism|prophets]] like [[Moses]] and [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], who caused thunderous storms to rain down on their enemies. (See {{bibleverse||Exodus|9:23}} and [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 12:18.)

Divinity always carries connotations of [[good and evil|goodness]], [[beauty]], beneficence, [[justice]], and other positive, pro-social attributes. In [[monotheistic]] faiths there is an equivalent cohort of malefic [[supernatural]] beings and powers, such as [[demons]], [[devil]]s, [[afreet]], etc., which are not conventionally referred to as divine; ''demonic'' is often used instead. [[Pantheistic]] and [[polytheistic]] faiths make no such distinction; gods and other beings of [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] power often have complex, ignoble, or even [[irrational]] motivations for their acts. Note that while the terms ''demon'' and ''demonic'' are used in [[monotheistic]] faiths as [[antonyms]] to ''divine'', they are in fact derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimón]]'' (δαίμων), which itself translates as ''divinity''.

There are three distinct usages of ''divinity'' and ''divine'' in religious [[discourse]]:

=== Entity ===
{{Main article|Deity}}
In monotheistic faiths, the word ''divinity'' is often used to refer to the [[singular God]] central to that faith. Often the word takes the [[definite article]] and is capitalized&amp;nbsp;— ''"the Divinity"''&amp;nbsp;— as though it were a [[proper name]] or definitive honorific. 
''Divine''&amp;nbsp;— capitalized&amp;nbsp;— may be used as an adjective to refer to the manifestations of such a Divinity or its powers: e.g. "basking in the Divine presence..."

The terms ''divinity'' and ''divine''&amp;nbsp;— uncapitalized, and lacking the definite article&amp;nbsp;— are sometimes used as to denote 'god(s)&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [http://www.stavacademy.co.uk/mimir/greatstag.htm "The Great Stag: A Sumerian Divinity"] by Bobula Ida (''Yearbook of Ancient and Medieval History'' 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; or certain other beings and entities which fall short of absolute Godhood but lie outside the human realm. These include (by no means an exhaustive list):

=== Divine force or power ===
As previously noted, divinities are closely related to the transcendent force(s) or power(s) credited to them,&lt;ref&gt;note Augustine's argument that divinity is not a quality of God, but that "God is [...] Divinity itself" (Nature and Grace, part I, question 3, article 3) [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/nature_grace.vi.iii.iii.html "Whether God is the Same as His Essence or Nature"]&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that in some cases the powers or forces may themselves be invoked independently. This leads to the second usage of the word ''divine'' (and a less common usage of ''divinity''): to refer to the operation of transcendent power in the world.

In its most direct form, the operation of transcendent power implies some form of [[Miracle|divine intervention]]. For pan- and polytheistic faiths this usually implies the direct action of one god or another on the course of human events. In Greek [[legend]], for instance, it was [[Poseidon]] (god of the sea) who raised the storms which blew [[Odysseus]]' craft off course on his return journey, and [[Japan]]ese tradition holds that a [[Kamikaze#Origin of the word Kamikaze|god-sent wind]] saved them from Mongol invasion. [[Prayer]]s or propitiations are often offered to specific gods of [[pantheism]]s to garner favorable interventions in particular enterprises: e.g. safe journeys, success in war, or a season of bountiful crops. Many faiths around the world&amp;nbsp;— from Japanese [[Shinto]] and Chinese traditional religion, to certain African practices and the faiths derived from those in the Caribbean, to Native American beliefs&amp;nbsp;— hold that [[ancestral]] or [[household deity|household deities]] offer daily protection and [[blessing]]s. In monotheistic religions, divine intervention may take very direct forms: [[miracles]], [[vision (spirituality)|vision]]s, or [[Intercession of saints|intercessions]] by blessed figures.

Transcendent force or power may also operate through more subtle and indirect paths. Monotheistic faiths generally support some version of [[divine providence]], which acknowledges that the divinity of the faith has a profound but unknowable plan always unfolding in the world. Unforeseeable, overwhelming, or seemingly unjust events are often thrown on 'the will of the Divine', in deferences like the [[Muslim]] ''inshallah'' ('as God wills it') and Christian 'God works in mysterious ways'. Often such faiths hold out the possibility of [[divine retribution]] as well, where the divinity will unexpectedly bring [[evil]]-doers to justice through the conventional workings of the world; from the subtle redressing of minor personal [[wrongs]], to such large-scale havoc as the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] or the biblical [[Great Flood]]. Other faiths are even more subtle: the doctrine of ''[[karma]]'' shared by [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] is a [[divine law]] similar to [[divine retribution]] but without the connotation of punishment: our acts, good or bad, intentional or unintentional, reflect back on us as part of the natural working of the [[universe]]. Philosophical [[Taoism]] also proposes a transcendent operant principle&amp;nbsp;— transliterated in English as ''tao'' or ''dao'', meaning 'the way'&amp;nbsp;— which is neither an entity or a being per se, but reflects the natural ongoing process of the world. Modern [[western mysticism]] and [[new age]] philosophy often use the term 'the Divine' as a noun in this latter sense: a non-specific [[principle]] or being that gives rise to the world, and acts as the source or [[wellspring of life]]. In these latter cases the faiths do not promote deference, as happens in monotheisms; rather each suggests a path of action that will bring the practitioner into conformance with the divine law: ''ahimsa''&amp;nbsp;— 'no harm'&amp;nbsp;— for Buddhist and Hindu faiths; ''de'' or ''te''&amp;nbsp;— 'virtuous action'&amp;nbsp;— in Taoism; and any of numerous practices of peace and love in new age thinking.

=== Mortals ===
{{main article|apotheosis}}
In the third usage, extensions of divinity and divine power are credited to living, mortal individuals. Political leaders are known to have claimed actual divinity in certain early societies&amp;nbsp;— the ancient [[Egyptian Pharaohs]] being the premier case&amp;nbsp;— taking a role as objects of worship and being credited with superhuman status and powers. More commonly, and more pertinent to recent history, leaders merely claim some form of divine [[mandate (theology)|mandate]], suggesting that their rule is in accordance with the will of God. The doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]] was introduced as late as the 17th century, proposing that [[king]]s rule by divine decree; Japanese Emperors ruled by divine mandate until the inception of the [[Japanese constitution]] after [[World War II]].

Less politically, most faiths have any number of people that are believed to have been touched by divine forces: [[saint]]s, [[prophet]]s, [[hero]]es, [[oracle]]s, [[martyr]]s, and enlightened beings, among others. [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], in Catholicism, is said to have received instruction directly from [[God]] and it is believed that he grants [[plenary indulgence]] to all who confess their sins and visit his chapel on the appropriate day.  In Greek mythology, [[Achilles]]' mother bathed him in the [[river Styx]] to give him immortality, and [[Hercules]]&amp;nbsp;— as the son of [[Zeus]]&amp;nbsp;— inherited near-godly powers. In religious [[Taoism]], [[Lao Tsu]] is venerated as a saint with his own powers. Various individuals in the Buddhist faith, beginning with [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]], are considered to be enlightened, and in religious forms of Buddhism they are credited with divine powers. Christ is said to have performed divine miracles.

In general, mortals with divine qualities are carefully distinguished from the deity or deities in their religion's main [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].&lt;ref&gt;This is sometimes a [[controversial]] issue, however; see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/features/emperor/index.shtml], for example, for a discussion of the status of the [[Japan]]ese emperor.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the Christian faith, which generally holds Christ to be identical to God, distinguishes between God the Father and Christ the begotten Son.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~emcd/index20.htm "The Divinity of Alpha's Jesus"] by Peterson &amp; McDonald (''Media Spotlight'' 25:4, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, certain esoteric and mystical schools of thought, present in many faiths&amp;nbsp;— [[Sufi]]s in Islam, [[Gnostic]]s in Christianity, Advaitan Hindus, [[Zen Buddhist]]s, as well as several non-specific perspectives developed in new age philosophy&amp;nbsp;— which hold that all humans are in [[essence]] divine, or unified with the Divine in a non-trivial way. Such divinity, in these faiths, would express itself naturally if it were not obscured by the social and physical worlds we live in; it needs to be brought to the fore through appropriate [[spiritual practice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.crimsoncircle.com/AboutUs/AboutTobias/TheAwakeningSigns.aspx "Twelve Signs of Your Awakening Divinity"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223313/http://www.crimsoncircle.com/AboutUs/AboutTobias/TheAwakeningSigns.aspx |date=December 2, 2013 }} by Geoffrey Hoppe and Tobias&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==

In traditional [[Christian theology]], the concept and nature of divinity always has its source ultimately from God himself. It's the state or quality of being divine, and the term can denote Godly nature or character.  In Hebrew, the terms would usually be "[[El (deity)|el]]", "[[elohim]]", and in Greek usually "theos", or "theias". The divinity in the Bible is considered the Godhead itself, or God in general. Or it may have reference to a deity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/divinity divinity] - The Free Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; Even angels in the [[Psalms]] are considered divine or ''elohim'', as spirit beings, in God's form. Redeemed Christians [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again]] or believers, according to Biblical verses, are said to partake of the "divine nature" through the "exceeding great and precious promises" of Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:4).

In the [[Christian Greek Scriptures]] of the Bible, the Greek word θεῖον (''theion'') in the [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douay Version]], is translated as "divinity". Examples are below:
* Acts 17:29
:"Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man."
* Romans 1:20
:"For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inexcusable."
* Revelation 5:12
:"Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction."

The word translated as either "deity", "Godhead", or "divinity" in the Greek New Testament is also the Greek word θεότητος (''theotētos''), and the one Verse that contains it is this:
Colossians 2:9
:"Quia in ipso inhabitat omnis plenitudo divinitatis [divinity] corporaliter." (Vulgate)
:"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." (KJV)
:"Because it is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily." (NWT)
:"For in him all the fullness of deity lives in bodily form." (NET)
:"For the full content of divine nature lives in Christ." (TEV)

The word "divine" in the New Testament is the Greek word θείας (''theias''), and is the adjective form of "divinity". Biblical examples from the [[King James Bible]] are below:
* 2 Peter 1:3
:"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue."
* 2 Peter 1:4
:"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."

=== Latter-day Saints ===
{{main article|God in Mormonism|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Mormon cosmology}}

The most prominent conception of divine entities in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]], a divine council of three distinct beings: [[Elohim]] ([[God the Father|the Father]]), [[Jehovah]] ([[God the Son|the Son]], or [[Jesus]]), and the [[Holy Spirit (Christian denominational variations)#Latter Day Saints|Holy Spirit]]. [[Joseph Smith]] described a [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] Godhead, with God the Father and Jesus Christ each having individual physical bodies, and the Holy Spirit as a distinct personage with a [[spirit body]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/130/22#21 D&amp;C 130:22] "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Godhead |work= True to the Faith |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2004 |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/godhead}}.

[[Mormons]] hold a belief in the divine potential of humanity; Smith taught a form of [[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]] where mortal men and women can become like god through [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|salvation]] and [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]].

The Arabic singular form ''dar'' ({{lang|ar|[[wikt:دار#Arabic|دار]]}}), translated literally, may mean "house", "abode", "structure", "place", "land", or "country". In [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] it often refers to a part of the world.

The notions of "houses" or "divisions" of the world in [[Islam]] such as ''Dar al-Islam'' and ''Dar al-Harb'' does not appear in the Quran or the [[Hadith]].&lt;ref name=Abdel-Haleem2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdel-Haleem|first1=Muhammad|authorlink=Muhammad Abdel-Haleem|title=Understanding the Qur'ān: Themes and Style|date=8 Sep 2010|publisher=I.

In classical [[Islamic law]], the major division are ''dar al-islam'' (lit. territory of Islam), denoting regions where Islamic law prevails,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e491 Dar al-Islam] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam &lt;/ref&gt; ''dar al-sulh'' (lit. territory of treaty) denoting non-Islamic lands which have concluded an armistice with a Muslim government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e496 Dar al-Sulh] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; and ''dar al-harb'' (lit. territory of war), denoting adjoining non-Islamic lands whose rulers are called upon to accept Islam.&lt;ref name=ODI-harb&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e490 Dar al-Harb] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early Islamic jurists devised these terms to denote legal rulings for ongoing [[Muslim conquests]] almost a century after [[Muhammad]]. The first use of the terms was in Iraq by [[Abu Hanifa]] and his disciples [[Abu Yusuf]] and [[Al-Shaybani]]. Among those in the [[Levant]], [[Al-Awza'i]] was leading in this discipline and later [[Shafi'i]].

The concept of ''dar al-harb'' has been affected by the political fragmentation of the Muslim world and has little significance today.&lt;ref name=ODI-harb/&gt;

===Dar al-Islam===
'''''Dar al-Islam''''' ({{lang-ar|دار الإسلام}} literally ''house/abode of Islam''; or '''''Dar as-Salam''''', ''house/abode of Peace'';{{fact|date=June 2017}} or '''''Dar al-Tawhid''''', ''house/abode of monotheism'') is a term used by Muslim [[ulama|scholars]] to refer to those countries where Muslims can practice their religion as the ruling sect. It is the area of the world under the rule of Islam, literally, "the home of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/dar-al-islam.htm|title=Dar al Islam|work=mideastweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are usually Islamic cultures wherein Muslims represent the majority of the population, and so the government promises them a privileged status. Most ''Dar al-Islam'' areas are surrounded by other Islamic societies to ensure public protection.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Some modern Muslim scholars believe that the labeling of a country or place as being a part of ''Dar al-Islam'' revolves around the question of religious security. This means that if a Muslim practices Islam freely in his place of abode, even though that place happens to be secular or un-Islamic, then he will be considered as living in the ''Dar al-Islam''. Yet, the majority opinion, which relies on tradition, claims that only countries ruled by Sharia can be considered true "abodes of peace."{{fact|date=June 2017}}

''Dar al-Islam'', or house/abode of Submission, is also known and referred to as ''Dar al-Salam'', or house/abode of Peace. The term appears in the [[Quran]] in 10.25 and 6.127 as a name of [[Jannah|Paradise]].&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. New Edition. Brill, Leiden. Vol. 2, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Abu Hanifa]], considered to be the originator of the concept, the requirements for a country to be part of ''Dar al-Islam'' are:&lt;ref name=fatwa&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544498 Fatwa by Sheikh `Atiya Saqr, former head of Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee, about the concept of Dar al-Harb and Dar al-Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206011857/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE |date=2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khalil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.islamway.com/bindex.php?section=article&amp;id=211 |title=Ahmed Khalil: "Dar Al-Islam And Dar Al-Harb: Its Definition and Significance" |publisher=English.islamway.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Muslims must be able to enjoy peace and security with and within this country.

# It has common frontiers with some Muslim countries.

===Dar al-Harb===
'''''Dar al-Harb''''' ({{lang-ar|دار الحرب|links=no}} "house of war". Dar al-Harb is a term classically referring to those countries which do not have a treaty of nonaggression or peace with Muslims (those that do are called Dar al-'Ahd or Dar al-Sulh). &lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e490?_hi=17&amp;_pos=3|title=Dar al-Harb|work=oxfordislamicstudies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Majid Khadduri]], the fundamental distinction between ''Dar al-Islam'' and ''Dar al-Harb'' was introduced after the defeat of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] at [[Battle of Tours]] in 732 which prevented the expansion of Islam to the north, while at the same time the expansion of the caliphate to the east had been halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4v4cCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=732#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Muslims and Modernity: Current Debates|author= [[Clinton Bennet]]|publisher= [[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year= 2005|page= 158|isbn= 9781441100504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wahbah al-Zuhayli]] argues that the concept of Dar al-Harb is mostly historical: "The existence of Dār al-Islām and Dār al-Ḥarb in contemporary times is rare or extremely limited. This is because Islamic countries have joined the United Nations covenant that stipulates relationship between nations is peace and not war. Therefore non-Muslim countries are Dār al-‘Ahd …"&lt;ref&gt;Al-Zuhaylī, Al-Mu‘āmalāt al-Māliyyah, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dar al-'Ahd, Dar al-Sulh===
'''Dar al-'Ahd''' ({{lang-ar|دار العهد|links=no}} "house of truce") or '''Dar al-[[Sulh]]''' ({{lang-ar|دار الصلح|links=no}} "house of conciliation/treaty") are terms used for territories that have a treaty of non-aggression or peace with Muslims. &lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

This designation can be found in the Quran, where Muslims are directed on how they should act in war:

"Excepting those who join a people between whom and you there is a treaty, or such as come to you with hearts reluctant to fight you, or to fight their own people. Had Allah wished, He would have imposed them upon you, and then they would have surely fought you. So if they keep out of your way and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah does not allow you any course [of action] against them." [https://quran.com/4/90 Quran 4:90]

The '''European Congress of Ethnic Religions''' ('''ECER''') is an organisation for cooperation among associations that promote the [[ethnic religion]]s of [[Europe]] &lt;ref&gt;"By Ethnic Religion, we mean religion, spirituality, and cosmology that is firmly grounded in a particular people's traditions. In our view, this does not include modern occult or ariosophic theories/ideologies, nor syncretic neo-religions.
[...]The World Congress of Ethnic Religions was established in June 1998 at the initiative of delegates from 16 different countries (Europe, Asia and America). This happened in Vilnius, Lithuania, the last European country to resist the onslaught of Christianity." [http://ecer-org.eu/about/ About ECER].&lt;/ref&gt;
The primary goal of the ECER is the strengthening of pre-Christian ethnic religious traditions of Europe, emphasizing and fostering their ties with [[Neopagan]] movements with ethnic focuses which developed during the 1980s to 1990s.

==History==

===As WCER===
The first "World Pagan Congress" was hosted in June 1998 in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], organized by [[Jonas Trinkunas]], the founder of [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a Lithuanian neopagan organization. The renaming from "Pagan" to "Ethnic" was the result of a day-long passionate debate.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Strmiska, ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives'', 2005 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qx7Tvd99xVAC&amp;pg=PA276  p. 276].&lt;/ref&gt;
The congress was held under the name "World Congress of Ethnic Religions" during 1999 to 2010.  The 2006 and 2009 conferences were held in [[India]], in the spirit of  collaboration between western Neopaganism and [[Hinduism]].

===As ECER===
The intention of a worldwide scope was "more of a dream than reality", as the congress mostly consisted of representatives of neopagan movements in Europe. To reflect this, the organization was renamed "European Congress of Ethnic Religions" in 2010, acting on a suggestion by Trinkunas.&lt;ref&gt;
"voglio rivalutare e ridefinire il termine con cui ci riferiamo a noi stessi. Mi riferisco a WCER – World Congress of Ethnic Religions (Congresso Mondiale delle Religioni Etniche). C’è una parola che suggerisco di discutere: il cambio del termine ‘mondiale’ con ‘europeo’. Perciò il nome dell’associazione cambierebbe in ECER – European Congress of Ethnic Religions (Congresso europeo delle Religioni Etniche)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member organisations==
Member organizations represent [[Baltic neopaganism|Baltic]], [[Slavic neopaganism|Slavic]], [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic]], [[Greek neopaganism|Greek]] and [[Roman neopaganism|Roman]] traditions. As of 2014 the member organizations of ECER are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">A '''Faith-based organization''' is an organization whose values are based on faith and/or beliefs, which has a mission based on social values of the particular faith, and which most often draws its activists (leaders, staff, volunteers) from a particular faith group. The faith to which the organization is relating to does not have to be academically classified as [[religion]]. The term "faith-based organization" is more inclusive than the term "[[religious organization]]" as it refers also to the non-congregation faith beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bielefeld|first=Wolfgang|last2=Cleveland|first2=William Suhs|date=2013-06-01|title=Defining Faith-Based Organizations and Understanding Them Through Research|url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/42/3/442|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=442–467|doi=10.1177/0899764013484090|issn=0899-7640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faith and Globalisation Initiative''' ('''FGI''') is an international group of universities created in 2008 by former [[British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and his [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Faith Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |title=Introduction to Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Yale University=21 Jan 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928130909/http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |archivedate=28 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Faith and Globalisation Initiative is "bringing together some of the world’s leading research Universities to form a global network focusing on the emerging field of faith and globalisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |title=Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation=21 Jan 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151638/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and key objectives==
In 2008 Yale University was the first university the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Foundation]] started working with and in 10 months it expanded the network to include the National University of Singapore, Durham University and McGill University. Two years later the Foundation developed an associate university programme which seeks to foster the study of faith and globalisation in a broad range of higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151655/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities |date=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institutions were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the Initiative, but also to ensure that they have a geographic and cultural spread that lends multiple perspectives to the discipline.

Key objectives of the FGI are the following:
* Develop multi-disciplinary teaching courses on Faith and Globalisation
* Advance knowledge in the field of Faith and Globalisation
* Disseminate university research related to Faith and Globalisation
* Engage policy-makers and the general public on the topic of Faith and Globalisation
* Support the implementation and development of the Foundation's Face to Faith and Faiths Act projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1936">'''Gerin oil''' or '''geriniol''' is a fictional drug used as a device to criticize [[religion]] in articles written by [[Richard Dawkins]]. The word is an [[anagram]] of "[[religion]]".

The first article, ''Gerin Oil'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anst.uu.se/dla05000/Gerin%20Oil.html Gerin Oil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725123716/http://www.anst.uu.se/dla05000/Gerin%20Oil.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in an American [[secular humanism]] publication, ''[[Free Inquiry]]'', in December 2003 (Volume 24, No. 1).  It was popularised in an article titled ''Opiate of the Masses''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7036 Opiate of the Masses]&lt;/ref&gt;  It describes a dangerous legal drug "Gerin Oil" or "Geriniol." Dawkins blames its effects as being responsible for historic acts of violence such as the [[September 11th attacks]], massacres of native South Americans by [[conquistadors]], and the [[Salem Witch Trials]].

In Dawkins' satirical description, users are often introduced to the "drug" at social gatherings such as weddings and funerals. In small amounts it is considered harmless, but its usage may increase over time. Medium usage of "Gerin Oil" is said to cause a disconnect with reality where users expect private wishes expressed to come true, and may be accompanied by spasmodic muscular movement or contraction. In large doses it is said to cause aural or visual hallucinations. He also links its use to child mutilation, sexual prohibition, and the tendency to smile when convicted of mass murder.

[[Christopher Hitchens]] included Dawkins' essay in his compilation ''[[The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Non-Believer|The Portable Atheist]]''.

This is an overview of the '''[[history]] of [[theology]]''' in [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] thought and its relationship with [[Abrahamic religions]].

==Ancient Greek and Hellenistic theology ==

===Classical Greek theology ===
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Hesiod.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Hesiod]]]] --&gt;Various forms of systematic and philosophical reflection on [[Ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology]] arose in the classical period—from [[Hesiod]]'s attempts to organize the diverse materials of mythology into a unified ''[[Theogony]]'' to the more properly philosophical analysis reportedly carried out by [[Socrates]].

Influential texts include:
* [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (c. 700 BC)
* [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (c. 360 BC)
* [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' Book Lambda (c. 330 BC)

{{Main|Ancient Greek religion#Theology|l1=Ancient Greek religion, section on Theology}}

===Hellenistic theology ===
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[Cicero]]]]
{{see also|Greek mythology#Hellenistic rationalism|l1=Greek mythology, Hellenistic rationalism|Ancient Greek religion#Theology}}
Philosophical reflection on the gods, on religion, and on the origins and governance of the Universe, flourished in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period among both Greek- and Latin-speaking thinkers.  Among the very diverse movements of Hellenistic philosophy in which theological reflection could be found were [[Skepticism]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]ism, [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Middle Platonism]], and [[Neoplatonism]].  The Skeptics were to have a larger impact on Western reasoning than the Cynics; but this would not occur until after its having been reified during the middle years of the Roman Empire when it passed into the mainstream of Western thought.

Influential texts include:
* [[Cleanthes]]' ''Hymn to Zeus'' (3rd century BC)
* [[Cicero]]'s ''[[de Natura Deorum]]'' (45 BC)
* [[Lucretius]]' ''[[On the nature of things|de Rerum Natura]]'' (1st century BC)
* [[Epictetus]]' ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Enchiridion]]'' (135)
* [[Plotinus]]' ''[[Enneads]]'' (c. 235 and after).

Hellenistic theology, which could be deemed to last until the suppression of the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Academy]] in 529 by [[Justinian I]], overlaps with early Jewish and early Christian theology (see below), and several strands of thought important particularly to early Christian thought arise within Hellenistic circles: attempts to explain the apparent caprice of the gods, [[Atheism]], the development of [[monotheism]], the idea of God as [[first cause]] or [[form of the Good]], the [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] of spirit and matter in humanity, and [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] (the release of the spirit from its material prison to a higher spiritual world) through knowledge.

==Early Jewish theology==
{{Judaism}}

===The 1st and 2nd centuries===
[[Image:Philon.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Philo]]]]Two strands of [[Jewish theology]] develop in the 1st and 2nd centuries.  On the one hand, there are those oral traditions of [[Rabbi]]nic exegesis ([[Midrash]]) and legal discussion ([[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]]) that eventually began to be written down towards the end of the 2nd century AD.

Important figures (known as [[Tannaim]]) include
* [[Hillel the Elder]] (working c. 30 BC to 10 AD)
* [[Shamai]] (c. 50 BC to 30 AD)
* [[Gamliel I]] (died c. 50)
* [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]] (1st century AD)
* [[Gamliel II]] (1st century D)
* [[Rabbi Akiva]] (c. 50 to c. 135)
* [[Simeon bar Yohai]] (2nd century AD)
* Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] (2nd century AD).

On the other hand, there is the attempt to accommodate traditional Jewish exegesis of the Jewish Scriptures and tradition with [[Greek philosophy]]—a strand of thought of which [[Philo]] (c. 20 BC to 40 AD) is the best known proponent. The destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem temple]] in 70 AD and the [[Diaspora|dispersion]] of many Jews from [[Israel]] had a profound effect on Jewish Theology.

===In the period of the Talmud ===
[[Image:V12p022a01 Talmud.jpg|left|thumb|100px|A page of [[Talmud]]]]In the centuries after its compilation, discussion and commentary upon the [[Mishnah]] flourished in Jewish academies in [[Israel]] and in [[Babylon]].  Collections of opinions from these discussions, known as [[Gemara]] were eventually edited together and placed with the Mishnah itself, in both Israel (around 350 AD – the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]) and Babylon (around 550 AD, with further editing in the two centuries that followed – the Babylonian [[Talmud]]).

Important figures (known as [[Amoraim]]) include
* Samuel of Nehardea (Shmuel) (c. 165 – c. 257)
* [[Resh Lakish]] (born c. 200)
* [[Hillel, son of Gamaliel III]] (3rd century)
* [[Abba Arika]] (Rav) (died 247)
* [[Yochanan bar Nafcha|Rabbi Yochanan]] (died c. 279)
* [[Abaye]] (278 – c. 338)
* [[Abbahu]] (died c. 320)
* [[Rav Ashi|Ashi]] (352–427)

==Early Christian theology==

===Theologies of the New Testament===
The [[New Testament]] contains evidence of some of the earliest forms of reflection upon the meanings and implications of Christian faith, mostly in the form of guidance offered to Christian congregations on how to live a life consistent with their convictions – notably in the [[paul of Tarsus|Pauline corpus]] and [[authorship of the Johannine works|Johannine corpus]].

===Patristic theology===
{{main|Patristics}}
A huge quantity of theological reflection emerged in the early centuries of the Christian church – in a wide variety of genres, in a variety of contexts, and in several languages – much of it the product of attempts to discuss how Christian faith should be lived in cultures very different from the one in which it was born.  So, for instance, a good deal of the [[Greek language]] literature can be read as an attempt to come to terms with Hellenistic culture.  The period sees the slow emergence of [[orthodoxy]] (the idea of which seems to emerge from the conflicts between [[catholic]] Christianity and [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christianity), the establishment of a [[Biblical canon]], debates about the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] (most notably between the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] in 325 and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 381), about [[Christology]] (most notably between the councils of Constantinople in 381 and  [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in 451), about the purity of the Church (for instance in the debates surrounding the [[Donatist]]s), and about [[Divine grace|grace]], [[free will]] and [[predestination]] (for instance in the debate between [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]).

Influential texts and writers in the 2nd century include:
* The collection known as the [[Apostolic Fathers]] (mostly 2nd century)
* [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100/114 – c. 162/168)
* [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died c. 215)
* [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] (c. 130 – 202)
* Various '[[gnosticism|Gnostic]]' authors, such as [[Valentinius]] (c. 100 – c. 153) and [[Basilides]] (c. 117–138)
* Some of the texts commonly referred to as the [[New Testament apocrypha]].

Influential texts and writers between c. 200 and 325 (the [[First Council of Nicaea]]) include:
* [[Tertullian]] (c. 155–230)
* [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] (died 235)
* [[Origen]] (c. 182 – c.251)
* [[Cyprian]] (died c. 258)
* [[Arius]] (256–336)
* Other [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] texts and texts from the [[New Testament apocrypha]].
Texts from patristic authors before 325 AD are collected in the [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]].

[[Image:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]]]Influential texts and writers between 325 AD and c. 500 AD include:
* [[Athanasius]] (298–373)
* The [[Cappadocian Fathers]] (late 4th century)
* [[Ambrose]] (c. 340–397)
* [[Jerome]] (c. 347–420)
* [[Chrysostom]] (347–407)
* [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430)
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (376–444)
Texts from patristic authors after 325 AD are collected in the [[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]]. Important theological debates also surrounded the various [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Councils]] – [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] in 325, [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 381, [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] in 431 and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in 451

==Medieval Christian theology==

===Byzantine theology===
While the Western Roman Empire declined and fell, the Eastern Roman Empire, centred on Constantinople, remained standing until 1453, and was the home of a wide range of theological activity that was seen as standing in strong continuity with the theology of the Patristic period; indeed the division between Patristic and Byzantine theology would not be recognised by many Orthodox theologians and historians.

[[Image:Gregor Palamas.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Gregory Palamas]]]]

====Mystical theology====
* [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (working c. 500)
* [[Symeon the New Theologian]] (949–1022)
* [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359)

====Christological controversy after Chalcedon====
* [[Severus of Antioch]] (c. 465–518)
* [[Leontius (writer)|Leontius of Jerusalem]] (working 538–544)
* [[Maximus the Confessor]] (c. 580–682)
* [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences]]
* [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic ecclesiastical differences]]

[[Image:John-of-Damascus 01.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[John of Damascus]]]]

====Iconoclasts and iconophiles====
* [[Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople]] (patriarch 715–730)
* [[John of Damascus]] (676–749)
* [[Theodore the Studite]] (c. 758 – c. 826)

===Western theology===

====Before the Carolingian Empire====
When the [[Roman Empire#The end of the Western Empire|Western Roman Empire fragmented]] under the impact of various 'barbarian' invasions, the Empire-wide intellectual culture that had underpinned late Patristic theology had its interconnections cut.  Theology tended to become more localised, more diverse, more fragmented.  The classically clothed Christianity preserved in Italy by men like [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] and [[Cassiodorus]] was different from the vigorous [[Franks|Frankish]] Christianity documented by [[Gregory of Tours]] which was different again from the Christianity that flourished in [[Ireland]] and [[Northumbria]] in the 7th and 8th centuries.  Throughout this period, theology tended to be a more [[monasticism|monastic]] affair, flourishing in monastic havens where the conditions and resources for theological learning could be maintained.

Important writers include:
* [[Caesarius of Arles]] (c. 468–542)
* [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] (480–524)
* [[Cassiodorus]] (c. 480 – c. 585)
* [[Pope Gregory I]] (c. 540–604)
* [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560–636)
* [[Bede]] (672–736)

====Theology in the time of Charlemagne====
Both because it made communication between different Christian centres easier, and because there was a concerted effort by its rulers to encourage educational and religious reforms and to develop greater uniformity in Christian thought and practice across their territories, the establishment of the [[Carolingian Empire]] saw an explosion of theological inquiry, and theological controversy.  Controversy flared, for instance, around 'Spanish [[Adoptionism]], around the views on predestination of [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]], or around the eucharistic views of [[Ratramnus]].

Important writers include:
* [[Alcuin]] (c. 735–804)
* The Spanish [[Adoptionism|Adoptionists]] [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]] and [[Elipandus]] of Toledo (late 8th century)
* [[Claudius of Turin]] (?–839)
* [[Rabanus Maurus]] (c. 780–856)
* [[Radbertus]] (c. 790–865)
* [[Ratramnus]] (died c. 868)
* [[Hincmar]] (806–882)
* [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]] (c. 808 – c. 867)
* [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (c. 815–877)

====Before Scholasticism====
With the division and decline of the Carolingian Empire, notable theological activity was preserved in some of the Cathedral schools that had begun to rise to prominence under it – for instance at [[Auxerre]] in the 9th century or [[Chartres]] in the 11th.  Intellectual influences from the Arabic world (including works of classical authors preserved by Islamic scholars) percolated into the Christian West via Spain, influencing such theologians as [[Gerbert of Aurillac]], who went on to become Pope Sylvester II and mentor to [[Otto III]].  (Otto was the fourth ruler of the Germanic [[Ottonian]] [[Holy Roman Empire]], successor to the Carolingian Empire).  With hindsight, one might say that a new note was struck when a controversy about the meaning of the eucharist blew up around [[Berengar of Tours]] in the 11th century: hints of a new confidence in the intellectual investigation of the faith that perhaps foreshadowed the explosion of theological argument that was to take place in the 12th century.

Notable authors include:
* [[Heiric of Auxerre]] (c. 835–887)
* [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (c. 841–908)
* [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]] (c. 950–1003)
* [[Fulbert of Chartres]] (died 1028)
* [[Berengar of Tours]] (c. 999–1088)
* [[Lanfranc]] (died 1089)

====Early Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
[[Anselm of Canterbury]] is sometimes misleadingly called the 'Father of Scholasticism' because of the prominent place that reason has in his theology; instead of establishing his points by appeal to authority, he presents arguments to demonstrate why it is that the things he believes on authority must be so.  His particular approach, however, was not very influential in his time, and he kept his distance from the Cathedral Schools.  We should look instead to the production of the [[Bible gloss|gloss]] on Scripture associated with [[Anselm of Laon]], the rise to prominence of [[dialectic]] (middle subject of the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]]) in the work of Abelard, and the production by [[Peter Lombard]] of a collection of [[Sentences]] or opinions of the Church Fathers and other authorities.  Scholasticism proper can be thought of as the kind of theology that emerges when, in the Cathedral schools and their successors, the tools of [[dialectic]] are pressed into use to comment upon, explain, and develop the gloss and the sentences.

[[Image:Anselm of Canterbury.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|Anselm of Canterbury]]

Notable authors include:
* [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033/1034–1109) 
* [[Anselm of Laon]] (died 1117)
* [[Hugh of St Victor]] (1078–1151)
* [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142)
* [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090–1153)
* [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179)
* [[Peter Lombard]] (c. 1100–1160)
* [[Joachim of Fiore]] (c. 1135–1202)

====High Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
The 13th century saw the attempted suppression of various groups perceived as heterodox, such as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] and the associated rise of the [[mendicant orders]] (notably the [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican order|Dominicans]]), in part intended as a form of orthodox alternative to the heretical groups.  Those two orders quickly became contexts for some of the most intense scholastic theology, producing such 'high scholastic' theologians as [[Alexander of Hales]] (Franciscan) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (Dominican), or the rather less obviously scholastic [[Bonaventure]] (Franciscan).  The century also saw a flourishing of [[mysticism|mystical theology]], with women such as [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] playing a prominent role.  In addition, the century can be seen as period in which the study of natural philosophy that could anachronistically be called 'science' began once again to flourish in theological soil, in the hands of such men as [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Roger Bacon]].

Notable authors include:
[[Image:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Aquinas]]]]
* [[Saint Dominic]] (1170–1221)
* [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175–1253)
* [[Francis of Assisi]] (1182–1226)
* [[Alexander of Hales]] (died 1245)
* [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] (1210–1285)
* [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294)
* [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274)
* [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274)
* [[Angela of Foligno]] (1248–1309)

====Late Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
{{See also|Scholasticism}}
Scholastic theology continued to develop as the 13th century gave way to the fourteenth, becoming ever more complex and subtle in its distinctions and arguments.  The 14th century saw in particular the rise to dominance of the [[nominalism|nominalist]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]] theologies of men like [[William of Ockham]].  The 14th century was also a time in which movements of widely varying character worked for the reform of the institutional church, such as [[conciliarism]], [[Lollardy]] and the [[Hussite]]s.  Spiritual movements such as the [[Devotio Moderna]] also flourished.

Notable authors include:
[[Image:Domenico Beccafumi 026.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[Catherine of Siena]]]]
* [[Meister Eckhart]] (1260–1328)
* [[Duns Scotus]] (1266–1308)
* [[Marsilius of Padua]] (1270–1342)
* [[Gottfried von Hagenau]] (c. 1270–1313)
* [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1285–1349)
* [[John Wycliffe]] (c. 1320–1384)
* [[Julian of Norwich]] (1342–1413)
* [[Geert Groote]] (1340–1384)
* [[Catherine of Siena]] (1347–1380)
* [[Jean Gerson]] (1363–1429)
* [[Jan Hus]] (c. 1369–1415)
* [[Thomas a Kempis]] (1380–1471)

==Islamic theology==
{{Islam}}
{{See also|Islamic theology|Kalam}}

===The beginnings of ''Kalam''===
{{Main|Qadr (doctrine)}}

[[Islamic theology]] or ''[[Kalam]]'', in the sense of ordered, rational reflection upon Allah and his Qur'an, is commonly held to begin at the end of the 7th century – the 1st century A.H. – with debates about divine and human freedom.

The ''[[Qadariyyah]]'' were those who defended a fairly strong view of human freedom, and included
* [[Ma'bad al-Juhani|Ma'bad ibn Khalid al-Juhani]] (died 699)
* [[Ghaylan ibn Marwan al Dimashqi]] (died 749)

'The ''Jabriyyah'' were their opponents, and included
* [[Jahm ibn Safwan (died 745)]]

===''Mu'tazilah''===
The ''Qadariyyah'' evolved into ''Mu‘tazilah'' which for some time was the dominant form of ''kalam'', imposed as official orthodoxy under the [[Abbasid]] dynasty, until the accession of [[Al-Mutawakkil]] in 847, after which it was suppressed.  For the five principal doctrines of Mutazilism, see the [[Mu'tazili#Tenets|main article]].  Prominent Mutazilite theologians include:
* [[Wasil ibn Ata]] (c. 700–748)
* [[Abu Huthail al-‘Allaf]] (c. 750–c.849)	
* Ibrahim [[al-Nazzam]] (died c. 846)
* [[al-Jahiz]] (c. 776–869)
* [[al-Jubba'i]] (died 916)
* [[al-Qadi Abdul Jabbar]] (died 1025)
* [[al-Mawardi]] (974–1058)
* [[Zamakhshari]] (died 1144)

===''Ash'aryah''===
From the late 10th century onwards, ''Mutazilite kalam'', opposition to which had hitherto been almost indistinguishable from opposition to ''kalam'' itself, found a new opponent ''within'' ''kalam'': ''[[Ash'ari]] kalam''.  ''Asharite kalam'' rose to become the dominant form of Islamic ''kalam'', and helped distinguish ''kalam'' from ''falasafa''—from philosophy (a distinction which is less clear when considering ''Mutazilite'' thought).

Prominent Asharites include:

* [[Abu l'Hasan al-Ashari]] (died 945)
* Abu Bakr [[al-Baqillani]] (died 1013)
* [[Abu'l Ma'ali al-Juwayni]] (1028–1085)
* [[Al-Ghazali]] (died 1111)
* [[Fakhr al-Din Razi]] (died 1209)

Note should also be taken of the variant of Asharism known as ''Maturidism''.  Prominent [[Maturidi]] authors include:
* [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]] (died 944)
* [[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi|al-Nasafi]] (died 1114)

===''Falasafa'' (Islamic philosophy) ===
Whilst the boundaries are sometimes rather porous, scholars of Islamic thought often make a distinction between ''Falasafa'' ([[Islamic philosophy]]) and ''Kalam'' (Islamic theology).  Prominent writers normally held to stand on the Falasafa side of the divide include:
* [[Al-Kindī]] (died 873)
* [[Al-Razi]] (865–925)
* [[Al-Farabi]] (870–950)
* [[Ibn Miskawayh]] (932–1030)
* Ibn Sina (Latinised form: [[Avicenna]]) (980–1037)

==Renaissance "poetic theology"==
[[Renaissance platonism|Renaissance Platonists]], most notably from Florentine circles (from [[Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]], to [[Cristoforo Landino|Landino]] and [[Politian]]), appealed to "poetic theology" ([[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]]) as a mythical theology independent of Biblical revelation  and thus, too, of Christian medieval theology.  The paradigmatic "poet theologian" was [[Orpheus]], a mythical legislator capable of subduing or civilizing beast-like men with his songs. Renaissance philosophers would adopt mythical ''personae'' such as that of Orpheus to carry out their civilizing function, as philosophical mediators between "sacred" authority and the "profane" lives subject to it.  Thus, e.g., Politian would emerge as a "new Orpheus", a philosopher in poetic garb.

The Renaissance judicious appeal to [[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]] would find its historical consummation in the works of [[Giambattista Vico]], whose discussions on "poet theologians" ([[Scienza Nuova]]) echoed Renaissance counterparts both literally and allegorically.

==Reformation and Counter-Reformation Christian theology==
[[Image:Martin_Luther,_1529.jpg|thumb|100px|Martin Luther]]
The [[Renaissance]] yielded scholars the ability to read the scriptures in their original languages and this in part stimulated the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], a theological movement that [[Protestation at Speyer|protested]] the outlawing of their faith at the [[Second Diet of Speyer]]. Its main themes were [[Sola fide|Justification by faith]], the [[Sola Scriptura|Bible as the only source of Christian teaching]], and the [[Priesthood of all believers]], and. Important figures include [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]],  [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], and the [[Anabaptists]]. [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theology was developed by successors such as [[Theodore Beza|Beza]], the English [[Puritans]] and [[Francis Turretin|Turretin]]. [[Lutheranism#Summary of doctrine|Lutheran theology]] entered a [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|period]] of doctrinal unity with the adoption of the [[Book of Concord]] and preserved it through the work of theologians such as [[Martin Chemnitz|Chemnitz]] and [[Johann Gerhard|Gerhard]].

The Roman Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] spearheaded by the [[Jesuits]] under [[Ignatius Loyola]] took their theology from the decisions of the [[Council of Trent]] and developed [[Second scholasticism|Second Scholasticism]], which they pitted against [[Lutheran scholasticism|Lutheran]] and [[Reformed scholasticism]]. The overall result of the Reformation was to highlight distinctions of belief that had previously co-existed uneasily.

The [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the East, 1453, led to a significant shift of gravity to the rising state of [[Russia]], the "Third Rome". The Renaissance stimulated a program of reforms by patriarchs of prayer books. A movement called the "[[Old Believers]]" consequently resulted and influenced [[Russian Orthodox]] Theology in the direction of [[conservatism]] and [[Erastianism]].

==Modern Christian theology==
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]]]
After the Reformation [[protestant]] groups continued to splinter, leading to a range of new theologies. The "[[Enthusiasts]]" were so named because of their emotional zeal. These included the [[Methodists]], the [[Quakers]] and [[Baptists]]. Another group sought to reconcile Christian faith with "Modern" ideas, sometimes causing them to reject beliefs they considered to be illogical, including the [[Nicene creed]] and [[Chalcedonian Creed]]. these included [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Universalists]]. A major issue for Protestants became the degree to which Man contributes to his salvation. The debate is often viewed as [[synergism (theology)|synergism]] versus [[monergism]], though the labels [[Calvinist]] and [[Arminian]] are more frequently used, referring to the conclusion of the [[Synod of Dort]].

The 19th century saw the rise of [[biblical criticism]], new knowledge of religious [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in other continents and above all the growth of [[science]]. This led many church men to espouse a form of [[Deism]]. This, along with concepts such as the brotherhood of man and a rejection of [[miracle]]s led to what is called "[[Liberal Christianity|Classical liberalism]]". Immensely influential in its day, classic liberalism suffered badly as a result of the two [[world wars]] and fell prey to the criticisms of [[postmodernism]].

[[Vladimir Lossky]] is a famous [[Eastern Orthodox]] theologian writing in the 20th century for the Greek church.

==Postmodern theology==
[[Postmodern theology]] seeks to respond to the challenges of post modern and deconstructionist thought, and has included the [[death of God]] movement, [[process theology]], [[feminist theology]] and [[queer theology]] and most importantly [[Neo-orthodox]] theology. [[Karl Barth]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] were Neo-Orthodoxy's main representatives. In particular Barth labeled his theology "dialectical theology", a reference to [[existentialism]].

The predominance of classic liberalism resulted in many [[reactionary]] movements amongst conservative believers. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] theology, [[Pentecostal]] or Renewal theology and [[fundamentalist]] theology, often combined with [[dispensationalism]], all moved from the fringe into the academy. [[Marxism]] stimulated the significant rise of [[liberation theology]]  which can be interpreted as a rejection of Academic Theology that fails to challenge [[the establishment]] and help the poor.

From the late 19th century to the early twentieth groups established themselves that derived many of their beliefs from Protestant evangelical groups but significantly differed in doctrine. These include the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Latter Day Saint]]s and others. Many of these groups use the Protestant version of the bible and typically interpret it in a fundamentalist fashion, adding, however, special prophecy or scriptures, and typically denying the trinity and the full deity of Jesus Christ.

[[Ecumenical]] theology sought to discover a common consensus on theological matters that could bring the many [[Christian denominations]] together. As a movement it was successful in helping to provide a basis for the establishment of the [[World Council of Churches]] and for some reconciliation between more established denominations. But ecumenical theology was nearly always the concern of liberal theologians, especially Protestant ones. The movement for ecumenism was opposed especially by fundamentalists and viewed as flawed by many neo-orthodox and [[confessional Lutheran]] theologians.

The pattern of challenge from a changing world, liberal response from official representatives and orthodox backlash from conservatives is found also in the history of Islam and Judaism. [[Reform Judaism]] represents a liberal interpretation as against [[Orthodox Judaism]], and moderate or [[liberal Islam]] continues to be theologically distinct from [[Islamic fundamentalism]], notably its [[Wahhabism|Wahabi]] and [[Deobandi]] Schools.

{{Gnosticism}}{{For|the video game|Hylics (video game)}}
'''Hylic''' (from Greek {{lang|grc|ύλη}}  (''hylē'') "matter") is the opposite of psychic (from Greek {{lang|grc|ψυχή}} (''psychē'') "soul").

In the [[gnostic]] belief system, '''hylics''', also called '''somatics''' (from Gk {{lang|grc|σώμα}} (''sōma'') "body"), were the lowest order of the three types of [[human]]. The other two were the psychics and the [[pneumatic (Gnosticism)|pneumatics]] (from Gk {{lang|grc|πνεύμα}} (''pneuma'') "spirit, breath"). So humanity comprised matter-bound beings, matter-dwelling spirits and the matter-free or immaterial souls.

Somatics were deemed completely bound to matter. Matter, the material world, was considered evil by the gnostics. The material world was created by a [[demiurge]], in some instances a blind, mad God, in others an army of rebellious [[angel]]s as a trap for the spiritual [[Simon Magus#Myth of Simon and Helen|Ennoia]]. The duty of (spiritual) man was to escape the material world by the aid of the hidden knowledge (gnosis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freke|first=Timothy|title=Jesus and the Lost Goddess: The Secret Teachings of the Original Christians|year=2001|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=978-1-4000-4594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somatics were human in form, but since their entire focus was on the material world, such as eating, sleeping, mating or creature comforts, they were seen as doomed. The pneumatic saw himself as escaping the doom of the material world via the secret knowledge. Somatics were thought to be incapable of understanding.

For consideration of these dynamics, see for example the [[Gospel of Judas]], believed to be a gnostic text, where Jesus is posited as a pneumatic and the other disciples, non-gnostics, as somatics.

'''''Interpretatio graeca''''' ([[Latin]], "Greek translation" or "interpretation by means of Greek [models]") is a [[discourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Characterized as "discourse" by Mark S. Smith, ''God in Translation: Deities in Cross-Cultural Discourse in the Biblical World'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2008, 2010), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religious concepts and practices]], [[List of Greek mythological figures|deities]], and [[Greek mythology|myths]] are used to interpret or attempt to understand the mythology and religion of other cultures. It is thus a [[Comparative religion|comparative]] methodology that looks for [[Comparative mythology|equivalencies and shared characteristics]]. The phrase may describe Greek efforts to explain others' beliefs and myths, as when [[Herodotus]] describes [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]] in terms of perceived Greek analogues, or when [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Plutarch]] document [[Cultus deorum|Roman cults]], [[Roman temple|temples]], and practices under the names of equivalent Greek deities. ''Interpretatio graeca'' may also describe non-Greeks' interpretation of their own belief systems by comparison or assimilation with Greek models, as when [[ancient Romans|Romans]] adapt Greek myths and iconography under the names of their own gods.

'''''Interpretatio romana''''' is comparative discourse in reference to [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], as in the formation of a distinctive [[Gallo-Roman religion]]. Both the Romans and the Gauls reinterpreted Gallic religious traditions in relation to Roman models, particularly [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

[[Jan Assmann]] considers the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] approach to internationalizing gods as a form of "intercultural translation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great achievement of polytheism is the articulation of a common semantic universe.&amp;nbsp;... The meaning of a deity is his or her specific character as it unfolded in myths, hymns, rites, and so on. This character makes a deity comparable to other deities with similar traits. The similarity of gods makes their names mutually translatable. … The practice of translating the names of the gods created a concept of similarity and produced the idea or conviction that the gods are international.&lt;ref&gt;''Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), pp. 44–54 (quotation p. 45),  as cited by Smith, ''God in Translation,'' p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] expressed the "translatability" of deities as "different names to different peoples" ''(nomina alia aliis gentibus).''&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 2.5.15.&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity made possible the [[syncretism|religious syncretism]] of the [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic era]] and the pre-Christian [[Roman Empire]].

==Examples==
[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|A Roman fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Hercules]] (from Etruscan ''[[Hercle]]'' and ultimately Greek ''[[Heracles]]'') and [[Achelous]] (patron deity of the [[Achelous River]] in Greece) from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century AD]]
[[Herodotus]] was one of the earliest authors to engage in this form of interpretation. In his observations regarding the Egyptians, he establishes Greco-Egyptian equivalents that endured into the [[Hellenistic era]], including [[Amun|Amon]]/[[Zeus]], [[Osiris]]/[[Dionysus]], and [[Ptah]]/[[Hephaestus]]. In his observations regarding the [[Scythians]], he equates their queen of the gods, [[Tabiti]], to [[Hestia]], [[Papaios]] and [[Api]] to [[Zeus]] and [[Gaia]] respectively, and [[Argimpasa]] to [[Aphrodite Urania]], whilst also claiming that the Scythians worshipped equivalents to [[Herakles]] and [[Ares]], but which he doesn't name.

Some pairs of Greek and Roman gods, such as Zeus and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], are thought to derive from a common [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] archetype ([[Dyeus]] as the supreme sky god), and thus exhibit shared functions by nature. Others required more expansive theological and poetic efforts: though both [[Ares]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] are war gods, Ares was a relatively minor figure in Greek religious practice and deprecated by the poets, while Mars was a father of the Roman people and a central figure of archaic Roman religion.

Some deities dating to Rome's oldest religious stratum, such as [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] and [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminus]], had no Greek equivalent. Other Greek divine figures, most notably [[Apollo]], were adopted directly into Roman culture, but underwent a distinctly Roman development, as when [[Augustus]] made Apollo one of his [[tutelary deity|patron deities]]. In the early period, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan culture]] played an intermediary role in transmitting Greek myth and religion to the Romans, as evidenced in the linguistic transformation of Greek ''[[Heracles]]'' to Etruscan ''[[Hercle|Her[e]cle]]'' to Roman ''[[Hercules]]''.

==''Interpretatio romana''==
The phrase ''interpretatio romana'' was first used by the [[Roman Empire|Imperial-era]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Tacitus]] in the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'' [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Germania#43 43.]&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus reports that in a [[sacred grove]] of the [[Nahanarvali]]&lt;!--also spelled Naharvali--&gt;, "a priest adorned as a woman presides, but they commemorate gods who in Roman terms ''(interpretatione romana)'' are [[Castor and Pollux]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu, sed deos interpretatione romana Castorem Pollucemque memorant."&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'' [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Germania#9 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; he identifies the principal god of the Germans as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], perhaps referring to [[Wotan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4rezhDpcWwkC&amp;pg=PA251 |title=Robert Leo Odom, '&amp;#39;Sunday in Roman Paganism'&amp;#39; (TEACH 2003 ISBN 978-1-57258242-2), pp. 251-252 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2003-01-01|accessdate=2013-01-24|isbn=9781572582422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sulis Minerva head Bath.jpg|thumb|Gilt bronze head from the cult statue of Sulis Minerva from the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Temple at Bath]]]]

Some information about the deities of the ancient [[Gauls]] (the [[continental Celts]]), who left no written literature other than inscriptions, is preserved by Greco-Roman sources under the names of Greek and Latin equivalents. A large number of [[Gaulish]] [[theonym]]s or cult titles are preserved, for instance, [[Mars (mythology)#Provincial epithets|in association with Mars]]. As with some Greek and Roman divine counterparts, the perceived similarities between a Gallic and a Roman or Greek deity may reflect a common Indo-European origin.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Koch, "Interpretatio romana," in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 974.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lugh]] was identified with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Nodens]] with Mars as healer and protector, [[Sulis]] with [[Minerva]]. In some cases, however, a Gallic deity is given an ''interpretatio romana'' by means of more than one god, varying among literary texts or inscriptions. Since the religions of the [[Greco-Roman world]] were not dogmatic, and [[polytheism]] lent itself to multiplicity, the concept of "deity" was often expansive, permitting multiple and even contradictory functions within a single divinity, and overlapping powers and functions among the diverse figures of each pantheon. These tendencies extended to cross-cultural identifications.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, "Interpretatio romana," in ''Celtic Culture'', pp. 974–975; Assmann, ''Moses the Egyptian'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern empire, the [[Teshub|Anatolian storm god]] with his [[labrys|double-headed axe]] became [[Jupiter Dolichenus]], a favorite cult figure among soldiers. Roman scholars such as [[Varro]] interpreted the monotheistic god of the Jews into Roman terms as [[Caelus]] or [[Jupiter Optimus Maximus]]. Some Greco-Roman authors seem to have understood the Jewish invocation of [[Yahweh]] [[Sabaoth]] as [[Sabazius]].

==''Interpretatio germanica''==
''Interpretatio germanica'' is the practice by the [[Germanic peoples]] of identifying Roman gods with the names of [[Germanic deities]]. According to [[Rudolf Simek]], this occurred around the 1st century of the common era, when both cultures came into closer contact. Some evidence for ''interpretatio germanica'' exists in the Germanic translations of the Roman [[Names of the days of the week|names for the days of the week]]:

* [[Sunday]], the day of [[Sowilō|Sunnǭ]] ({{lang-on|Sunna}}, ''Sól''; {{lang-ang|Sunne}}; {{lang-goh|Sunna}}), the sun (as female), was earlier the day of [[Sol Invictus]], the sun (as male)
* [[Monday]], the day of [[Máni|Mēnô]] (Máni; Mōna; Māno), the moon (as male), was earlier the day of [[Moon|Luna]], the moon (as female)
* [[Tuesday]], the day of [[Tyr|Tīwaz]] (Týr; Tīw; Ziu), was earlier the day of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war
* [[Wednesday]], the day of [[Odin|Wōdanaz]] (Óðinn; Wōden; Wuotan), was earlier the day of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], god of travelers and eloquence
* [[Thursday]], the day of [[Thor|Þūraz/Þunraz]] (Þórr; Þunor; Donar), was earlier the day of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], god of thunder; Þunraz may elsewhere appear identified with the club-wielding [[Hercules]]
* [[Friday]], the day of [[Frijjō]] (Frigg; Frīg; Frīja), was earlier the day of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], goddess of love

In most of the [[Romance languages]], which derive from Latin, days of the week still preserve the names of the original Roman deities, such as the Italian for Tuesday, ''martedì'' (from the Latin ''Martis dies''). This is also the case with Saturn in some [[West Germanic languages]]; such as the English "Saturday", the [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''[[:fy:Sneon|Saterdei]]'', the [[Low German]] ''[[:nds:Saterdag|Saterdag]]'' and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[:nl:Zaterdag|zaterdag]]'' all meaning [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]'s day.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Saturday&amp;allowed_in_frame=0]

Simek emphasizes the paucity of evidence and notes that comparison with Roman gods is insufficient to reconstruct ancient Germanic gods and equate them definitively with those of later [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf. (2007) Translated by Angela Hall. ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology''. [[Boydell &amp; Brewer|D.S. Brewer]], p. 74. {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman equivalents==
The following is a list of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Egyptian, and Phoenician equivalents, based on usage among the ancients themselves, supported by the analyses of modern scholars.{{cn|date=June 2018}} "Equivalent" should not be taken to mean "the same god". For instance, when the myths or even cult practices of a particular Roman deity were influenced by the Greek or Etruscan tradition, the deity may have had an independent origin and a tradition that is culturally distinctive.

==Application to the Jewish religion==

From the Roman point of view, it was natural to apply the above principle also to the [[Jew]]ish God [[Jehovah]] and equate him with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. However, the Jews – unlike other people living under Roman rule – rejected out of hand any such attempt, regarding such an identification as the worst of sacrilege. This complete divergence of views was one of the factors contributing to the frequent friction between the Jews and the Roman Empire – for example, the Emperor [[Hadrian]]'s decision to rebuild [[Jerusalem]] under the name of [[Aelia Capitolina]], a city dedicated to Jupiter, precipitated the bloodbath of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].

In late antiquity mysticism, the sun god [[Helios]] is sometimes equated to the Judeo-Christian God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/15325/6623]&lt;/ref&gt;

A central theme of many religions is what happens to people upon death. Almost all religions are greatly devoted to the afterlife, emphasizing that what you do in your current life affects what happens to you in the [[afterlife]]. This usually takes the form of '''judgement''' by a deity, in which ones deeds and characteristics in life determine either punishment or reward (when one has been mostly good).

== Ancient religions ==
=== Ancient Egypt ===
[[Image:Egypt dauingevekten.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' written on papyrus showing the "Weighing of the Heart" in the [[Duat]].]]
In Ancient Egypt, it was believed that upon death, one's fate in the afterlife was determined by the weighing of one’s heart. One's heart was kept within the body during mummification so that it can travel with the deceased into the afterlife. Upon death, one entered the underworld ([[Duat]]), where [[Anubis]], the God of the dead, weighed the persons heart on a scale against the feather of [[Ma’at]], the goddess of order, truth, and righteousness. If the heart weighed more than the feather, meaning that the person was more wicked than good, then the heart would be devoured by [[Ammit]], a demon with the head of a crocodile, the front half of the body of a leopards, and the back half of a hippopotamus, but with goat arms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touregypt.net/godsofegypt/ammit.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's heart was devoured by Ammit, then he would die a second death and be completely annihilated from existence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/dead.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Greece ===
Ancient Greeks believed that upon death, an individual would enter the realm of Hades, the Greek underworld, and be judged by [[King Minos]], [[Aeacus]], and [[Radamanthus]]. Depending on one's actions in life, an individual would be sent to one of three different planes: [[Elysium]], the [[Asphodel Fields]], or [[Tartarus]]. Elysium is for those who were righteous in life and is reserved for good people and legendary heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Kosmos/Elysion.html|title=ELYSIUM, ISLAND OF THE BLESSED : Greek Mythology|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Elysium people relax and enjoy a life of everlasting joy in a beautiful and comfortable field with trees and sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0162:book=O.:poem=2|title=Pindar, Olympian, Olympian 2 For Theron of Acragas, Chariot Race, 476 B. C.|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Acard%3D535 |title=P. Vergilius Maro, Aeneid, Book 6, line 535|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asphodel Fields is the land of neutrality, where those who were either neutral, or whose good and bad deeds are about equal reside. It is a bland place symbolizing their lack of notability in life. The final realm, Tartarus, is the realm of the wicked. It is the deepest realm of Hades, and those who have performed wicked deeds are punished here for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Kosmos/Tartaros2.html|title=TARTARUS, DUNGEON OF DAMNED : Greek mythology|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment here reflects the wicked deeds committed in one's life (e.g., [[Tantalus]] killed and fed his son to the Gods, so he was punished by being made to stand in a pool surrounded by trees with fruit, but can partake of neither water nor fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0022:text=Epitome:book=E:chapter=2&amp;highlight=tantalus|title=Apollodorus, Epitome, book E, chapter 2 |publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Mortals shared this realm with non-mortals.

== Dharmic==
[[Hinduism]] was extremely influential, with aspects and gods from Hinduism being borrowed into other religions not only in India, but also in China, Korea, and Japan. As such, many of the Asian religions have similarities in myths, deities, and concepts.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hinduism, people are judged by [[Yama]], the God of Death, in accordance with [[Karma]]. Depending on whether or not and how closely one adhered to one's duties in life, as well as one's deeds, they would be either punished or rewarded in their next life after reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma|title=karma – Indian philosophy|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who performed their duties and performed good deeds would reincarnate into a higher class, spending some time between lives in bliss in heaven, whereas those who did not follow the rules of their caste and performed bad deeds in life were either reincarnated into lower classes or lower lifeforms, such as animals, as well as sent to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] (the equivalent of Hell) and tortured by various means between lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gpu/index.htm|title=The Garuda Purana|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several layers to Naraka, and people are sent to different ones for different punishments based on the severity and nature of their misdeeds in life.

=== Buddhism ===
[[Buddhism]] applies the principles of Karma and reincarnation much the same way that Hinduism does. There are several differing versions. In some there is no God that passes down judgement on individuals to either determine their future life or to reward or punish them for their current one. In such cases, humans, as well as all other beings except for the [[Buddha]]s who have reached Nirvana, simply follow the cycle of reincarnation based on Karma until they can reach Nirvana.{{cn|date=May 2017}} In some other versions of Buddhism, Yama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y53pT_gGE_0C&amp;pg=PA78|page=78|title=Buddhist Symbolism in Tibetan Thangkas: The Story of Siddhartha and Other Buddhas Interpreted in Modern Nepalese Painting|publisher=Binkey Kok|author=Ben Meulenbeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as conceptions of Naraka and punishment, are adopted from Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mantramañjari|author=Raimundo Panikkar|publisher=Raimundo Panikkar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M01LSxaneasC&amp;pg=PA884|page=884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese Religion ===
Chinese religion borrows heavily form Hinduism and Buddhism, including Yama and Naraka ([[Diyu]]). However, Karma and the Caste system is not employed; thus reincarnation, as well as rewards and punishment between lives and in Diyu, are based solely on good or bad deeds in life. The wicked are tortured in Diyu, which contains different levels with different punishments, just like in Hinduism, and are reincarnated either into humans with bad luck and conditions or into animals. Those who are righteous and good are either reincarnated into humans with good fortune and status or are accepted into heaven

== Abrahamic religions ==
=== Judaism ===
In [[Judaism]], judgement occurs by [[God]] during the transition from the current earthly world "Olam Ha-Zeh" to the world to come "[[Olam Ha-Ba]]", which is roughly the equivalent of paradise or Eden. Those who followed all of the seven laws given to Moses, including non-Jews, would be considered righteous gentiles and allowed to enter Olam Ha-Ba. In contrast, those who did not obey the rules and were wicked would spend time in [[Gehenna]] for spiritual purification. Gehenna was a fiery place similar to common conceptions of Hell, where the wicked would be tortured for a maximum of one year's time in order to purify them for Olam Ha-Ba. Those who were too wicked would instead be completely destroyed after being tortured in Gehenna.

=== The Catholic Church ===
Catholics believe that all men, women, and children whether just or unjust will be resurrected, and shall come to The Day of Judgment both in body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;1 Thess 4:16, Rev. 20:4–5, 1 Cor 15:52&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are judged according to their deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 20:12, Eccl. 12:14, Rom 2:6&lt;/ref&gt; Those found pure are saved and welcomed into the kingdom, for nothing impure shall pass through the gates of God's Kingdom, but those found wanting enter everlasting damnation.&lt;ref&gt;Rev 21:27, Matt. 5:8, Matt. 25:45, Catholic Catechism paragraphs 1020–1065&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics believe that while salvation is by and through the grace of God, that human cooperation with grace is necessary as evidenced by the Parable of The Talents.&lt;ref&gt;Matt. 25:14–30&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the works done to merit salvation are not merited in virtue of the human's own being, who is a sinner, but as a servant and friend who acts well with the graces given them freely; thus faith without works is deemed Solo Fides and is rejected by Catholics, but so too works without Faith is rejected as Pelagianism by Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;James 2:14–26, Council of Diospolis&lt;/ref&gt; Judgment Day is thus considered to require both Faith as a gift from above, but also the works of the human are judged, just as a branch of a vine is judged by its fruits.&lt;ref&gt;John 15:15, Luke 3:9&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics also believe in Purgatory, but as a place that is pre-Judgment Day, a purifying locale for those preparing for The Day of Judgment. If souls are purifed before Judgment Day they are released where they join the Saints who are spirits without bodies, enjoying an intellectual vision of The Father who is without body, known as The Beautific Vision. There the Saints await The Day of Judgment knowing they will be resurrected to receive their bodies and will be judged pure by The Trinity, confirmed by the Apostles and Patriarchs.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 4:4&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are humans judged on That Day, but so too are other creatures like angels,.&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 6:3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church differs from other World beliefs in that it maintains God cannot be a Higher Power, for this claims God is in time and space as one of many powers, but is necessarily outside all Creation. The Catholic God is thus transcendent in The Godhead, yet immanent in The Incarnation and present in Baptism. Most importantly, this God is said to be Three Persons in One Essence. Salvation is by good deeds worked through, by, and in the grace of God. The Ordo Salutis is thus: The Father calls one to Baptism in Christ, through The Holy Spirit, and then the believer cultivates the virtues of Fatih, Hope, and Love through work to merit salvation through the grace given them in the sacraments, and continuously fed by the sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;John 6:44, John 14:6&lt;/ref&gt; Christ's place in The Godhead is as Logos incarnate, as both the lamb of God given for the sins of the world and the High Priest, making him both the one sacrificing and the sacrifice, which still require human response and agency to God's first act of call and action.&lt;ref&gt;John 1:29, Rev. 5:6, Heb. 4:14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestantism ===
Protestants believe that the deceased leave their bodies and their spirit faces judgement for sin by God. Since all humans sin, the only way into Heaven is faith in Jesus Christ,&lt;ref&gt;John 14:6, Solo Fides&lt;/ref&gt; who is both God's Son&lt;ref&gt;1 John 4:15&lt;/ref&gt; and God in human form.&lt;ref&gt;John 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; Good deeds in this life store up treasures in heaven – entering into Heaven (the true life) is worth far more than earthly riches and honor.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 6:20&lt;/ref&gt; All others go to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/ref&gt; Once in Hell, people will suffer to varying degrees depending on their deeds in life.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 20:11–15&lt;/ref&gt; This punishment is eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Mark 9:48&lt;/ref&gt; When the world ends all of the dead will come back to life for their permanent judgement and placed in a new Heaven, Earth and Hell.&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 15:36–58&lt;/ref&gt; Protestantism differs from other World beliefs in that while it allows a distinct avenue for judgement by a Higher Power, passage into a comfortable eternal life cannot be earned, but happens due to the self-sacrifice of that Higher Power by Solo Fides.&lt;ref&gt;John 3:16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
In [[Islam]], there are two general paths after death: the first is [[Jannah]], roughly the equivalent of paradise, and the second is [[Jahannam]], the equivalent to Hell. One's assignment to Jannah or Jahannam are determined by one's deeds in life. Those who believe in and follow the rules laid out, as well as who perform good deeds, are allowed to enter Jannah, whereas those who do not believe in Islam or are unfaithful to it are punished in Jahannam. Jannah is a garden of perpetual bliss; its inhabitants live in a state of happiness and satisfaction with no worries or problems. They live in beautiful conditions in which they get everything they desire: beautiful clothes, servants, surroundings, food, etc.; all of the things indicative of a perfect life in the current world. In addition, they are brought close to God. Those in Jahannam are tortured, primarily by methods relating to fire, for eternity, or until [[Allah]] wills for it to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/pick/index.htm|title=The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'ân, Index|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Kitáb-i-Aqdas''''' or '''''Aqdas''''' is the central book of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] written by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the religion, in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Saiedi, 2000, pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written in Arabic under the Arabic title '''''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Kitābu l-Aqdas}}''''' ({{lang-ar|الكتاب الأقدس}}  / ''al-Kitāb al-ʾaqdās''), but it is commonly referred to by its Persian title, ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' ({{lang-fa|كتاب اقدس}}  / ''Ketâb Âqdas''), which was given to the work by Bahá'u'lláh himself. It is sometimes also referred to as  "the Most Holy Book", "the Book of Laws" or the '''Book of Aqdas'''. The word Aqdas has a significance in many languages as the superlative form of a word with its primary letters [[Q-D-Š]].

Bahá'u'lláh had manuscript copies sent to Bahá'ís in Iran some years after the revelation of the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' in 1873, and in 1890–91 (1308 [[Islamic calendar|AH]], 47 [[Baha'i calendar|BE]]) he arranged for the publication of the original Arabic text of the book in Bombay, India.

The ''Aqdas'' is referred to as "the Mother-Book" of the Bahá'í teachings, and the "Charter of the future world civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|pp=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not, however, only a 'book of laws': much of the content deals with other matters, notably ethical exhortations and addresses to various individuals, groups, and places. The ''Aqdas'' also discusses the establishment of Bahá'í administrative institutions, Bahá'í religious practices, mysticism, laws of personal status, criminal law, spiritual and ethical exhortations, social principles, miscellaneous laws and abrogations, and prophecies.

{{main|Bahá'í laws}}

Bahá'u'lláh stated that the observance of the laws that he prescribed should be subject to "tact and wisdom", and that they do not cause "disturbance and dissension."&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=law |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aqdas6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1873|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh thus provided for the progressive application of his laws; for example certain Bahá'í laws are only applicable to [[Middle East]]ern Bahá'ís such as the limit to the period of engagement, while any Bahá'í may practice the laws if they so decide.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]] also stated that certain other laws, such as criminal laws, that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society would only be applicable in a possible future Bahá'í society.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSmith160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that if the laws were in conflict with the civil law of the country where a Bahá'í  lives the laws could not be practiced.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt; Furthermore, some laws and teachings are, according to Bahá'í teaching, not meant to be applied at the present time and their application depends on decisions by the [[Universal House of Justice]]. Baha'is believe the Aqdas supersedes and succeeds previous revelations such as the [[Quran]] and the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bhi/aqdas.htm The Aqdas; Universal House of Justice] A DESCRIPTION OF THE AQDAS BY SHOGHI EFFENDI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form and style ==

The text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas consists of several hundred verses, which have been grouped in 189 numbered paragraphs in the English translation most of which are just a few sentences.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danesh |first=Roshan |title=Internationalism and Divine Law: A Bahá'í Perspective |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=209–242 |year=2003–2004 |jstor=3649175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style combines elements of both [[Arabic poetry|poetry]] (''shi'r'') and [[rhymed prose]] (''saj{{'}}'') and the text contains instances of [[literary devices]] like [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[onomatopoeia]], [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtaposition]] and [[antithesis]], [[metaphor]]s, [[Narration#Narrative point of view#Alternating person|alternation of person]] and [[personification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushrui|1994|pp=39–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules and principles are interspersed and guide interpretation, and authority and limits for authorized interpretation are also specified. It defines a [[Bahá'í Administration]] as part of the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh]], and also speaks to the individual reader, as there are no [[clergy]] in the religion to rely on for guidance. The text also moves between statements said to be plain and statements suggesting the key to understanding the book is to look at the text for clues to itself.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt; Some statements reflect on the [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]] in the religion on various themes and underscore a relationship of the Aqdas as a 'motherhood' in relation to all the other scriptural works and they to it. It also relates to scriptures of other religions by abrogation, explanation, affirmation or reformation &amp;mdash; an example of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]] as a principle of the religion. While it is the core text on laws of the religion, it is not the exclusive source of laws in the religion, nor of Bahá'u'lláh's own writings, and complementarily the reader is told explicitly to not view the text as a "mere code of laws".&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Udo |title=An Introduction to Baha'i Law: Doctrinal Foundations, Principles and Structures |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=307–372 |year=2002–2003 |jstor=1602268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas was completed by Bahá'u'lláh in 1873.

== Content ==

The ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' is supplemented by the 
*"Questions and Answers"', which consists of 107 questions submitted to Bahá'u'lláh by [[Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin]] concerning the application of the laws and Bahá'u'lláh's replies to those questions
*"Some Texts Revealed by Bahá'u'lláh"
*''Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances'', prepared by [[Shoghi Effendi]]
*explanatory notes prepared by the [[Universal House of Justice]]

The book was divided into six main themes in the ''Synopsis and Codification'' by Shoghi Effendi:
#The appointment of [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] as the successor of Bahá'u'lláh
#Anticipation of the Institution of the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardianship]]
#The Institution of the Universal House of Justice
#Laws, Ordinances and exhortations
#Specific admonitions, reproofs and warnings
#Miscellaneous subjects

Further, the laws were divided into four categories:
:A. Prayer
:B. Fasting
:C. Laws of personal status
:D. Miscellaneous laws, ordinances and exhortations

===Themes===
Scholarly review finds the Aqdas has themes of laws of worship, societal relations and administrative organization, or governance, of the religion.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt; Through the authority vested in [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] in the Aqdas there is an expanse of [[Cosmopolitanism|internationalism]] related to the law in works like ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'' and through his extended authority to [[Shoghi Effendi]] works like his ''[[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]]'' further elaborates on the internationalism theme. This stands in some distinction from other scriptures by not using triumphal tones as the voice of God is given to be viewed but rather one of progressive development, social context, and outright delay in application until another day. Indeed, it insists that divine law is applicable only in situations with requisite conditions, where it is likely to have certain social effects. The goal of application of the law and its methods are not to cause disturbance and dissension and requires an appreciation for context and intention. Additionally one is to eschew emphasis in the development of [[textualist]] and [[intentionalist]] arguments about the law though some of this is visible in scholarship on the Aqdas. Such methods of application of law in a religious context are, in the opinion of Roshan Danish, common in Islam and Judaism.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;

The Aqdas is understood by Bahá'ís to be a factor in the process of ongoing developments in world order. This can be seen comparing the Bahá'í approach to history and the future to that of the theory of [[The Clash of Civilizations]] on the one hand and the development of a [[posthegemony]] system on the other (compared with work of Robert Cox, for example, in ''Approaches to World Order'', (Robert Cox &amp; Timonthy Sinclair eds, Cambridge University Press, 1996).)&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;

Certain possible sources of law are specifically abrogated: laws of the Bábí religion, notably in the ''[[Persian Bayán]]'', oral traditions (linked with [[Bahá'í literature#Authenticity and authority|pilgrim notes]], and natural law, (that is to say God's sovereign will through revelation is the independent authority.)&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt; Divine revelation's law-making is both unconditioned in terms of the divine right to choose, and conditioned in the sense of the progress of history from one revelation to the next.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt;

====Laws of personal status====

=====Marriage and divorce=====
{{main|Bahá'í marriage}}
Baha'u'llah's statements about marriage in the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' are brief. Marriage is highly recommended but is stated to not be obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=marriage |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=232–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh states that the maximum number of wives is two, but also states that having only one wife would add more tranquility to both partners.&lt;ref name="polygamy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Polygamy |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statements were later interpreted by [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] that having a second wife is conditional upon treating both wives with justice and equality and was not possible in practice, thus establishing monogamy.&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge205"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |location=Cambridge |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-m"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Udo |title=An Introduction to Baha'i Law: Doctrinal Foundations, Principles and Structures |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=321, 333 |year=2002–2003 |jstor=1602268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Bahá'u'lláh]] had three wives,&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his religion teaches monogamy, which has been the subject of criticism. The writing of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and Bahá'í teachings on gender equality and monogamy post-date Bahá'u'lláh's marriages and are understood to be evolutionary in nature, slowly leading Bahá'ís away from what had been a deeply rooted cultural practice.&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-m"/&gt;

====Administration====
{{main|Bahá'í administration}}
The institutional status of the authority of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and a House of Justice are specifically delineated.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt; On the basis of the authority granted 'Abdu'l-Bahá he extended forms of the authority vested in him to the Guardianship, whose sole member was Shoghi Effendi, and the Universal, or International, House of Justice through his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]]. This was confirmed and amplified in other texts, notably the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh#Kit.C3.A1b-i-.60Ahd|Kitáb-i-'Ahd]]. The Universal House of Justice is specifically empowered to write and rescind any laws it is felt necessary aside from those of the text of scripture and actual application of the laws of the Aqdas among Bahá'ís are dependent on the choice of the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">The '''''Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations''''' (Russian: «Закон О свободе совести и о религиозных объединениях»), also known as the 1997 Law  (Russian: «Закон 1997 года») is a [[Russia]]n law passed and signed by President [[Boris Yeltsin]] on September 26, 1997.&lt;ref name="Law of Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association"&gt;[http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/freedomofconscienceeng.html], the translation of the law from Stretson University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law redefined the state's relationship with religion, as Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had defined in on the Law of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on Freedom of Worship passed on October 25, 1990, commonly known as the 1990 Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://host.uniroma3.it/progetti/cedir/cedir/Lex-doc/Ru_l_1990.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[fall of Communism]], Gorbachev had given much-needed breathing room to the practice of religion in Russia, whose culture's heart is Eastern Orthodoxy, but had also opened the door indescriminately and generally to the practice of religion. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] believed that a new law was needed to preserve Russia against what they considered to be the corruption of Orthodoxy.

The law was formulated and pushed by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], secular nationalists, and communists alike, with such determination that though Yeltsin vetoed the bill once, he could not legitimately do so a second time.

Written in the law was the upholding of separation of church and state, as well as an interdiction against a state religion.  With that in mind, the following definitions and regulations are given:

==Definitions==
* ''religious organizations:'' at the level of individual church congregations
* ''religious associations:'' whole denominations
* ''religious groups:'' groups without legal status, such as a bible study group

==Regulations==
* Organizations may only be founded by Russian citizens
: ''this ostensibly provided for national security.''

* All associations must have a religious purpose, including:
** a [[creed]],
** regular worship services,
** the conducting of religious education.
: ''aimed at [[Evangelicalism#Evangelical para-church organizations|para-church]] organizations such as [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] and the [[Salvation Army]].''

* No organization may function until they have been registered with the government for 15 years, unless it affiliates with an existing association.  During the wait, the following is forbidden:
** public worship services,
** distribution of literature and materials,
** the hiring of foreign clergy.
: ''this discouraged independent-style and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches such as [[Baptists]].''

* A religious group may be liquidated by the government for any of the following reasons:
** creating an armed [[militia]] unit,
** threatening the integrity of the [[Russian Federation]],
** infringing on the health of its citizens,
** restricting its members from leaving the religion,
** encouraging its members to disobey civic duties.

==Effects==
Religion under the new law became nearly as regulated as it had been in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, though without the official communist hostility.  It did accomplish some expulsion of [[Western culture|Western]] religious work, though it left room for some foreign churches to legitimately register.  There had been on the order of 16,000 registered organizations before the passage of the law, and by 2004 there were 22,000.  By regulating on grounds common among new, foreign organizations, it made it difficult for them to take root, and it succeeded in promoting and securing a privileged place for the Russian Orthodox Church.

On June 22, 2005, debate of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) concluded, that the 1997 Law "creates a complex form of categorization of religions which has led to various forms of discrimination and to the stigmatization of 'non-traditional' religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dimarzio.info/it/docum/finish/7-acm-europe/251-a-case-study-fecris.html|title=A Case Study: FECRIS|last=Besier|first=Gerhard|last2=Seiwert|first2=Hubert|publisher=Lit verlag|year=2012|isbn=978-3-643-99894-1|location=Berlin|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Letter of Benan''' was a [[literary forgery]] issued by Ernst Edler von der Planitz in 1910, allegedly a translation from a fifth-century [[Coptic language|Coptic]] papyrus containing a translation of an original composed in Greek in 83 CE.  There is no evidence that either the Greek or Coptic works ever existed.&lt;ref name=Goodspeed&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#7|title=Strange New Gospels|authorlink=Edgar J. Goodspeed|last=Goodspeed|first=Edgar J.|year=1931|publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1931)|pages=73–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a letter purporting to be of an [[Egypt]]ian physician describing his encounters with [[Jesus]] and the apostles. Internal evidence and historical inconsistencies, in the absence of the purported original manuscripts, clearly indicate this work to be a fake. It is thus counted among the [[modern apocrypha]].&lt;ref name=Goodspeed /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10001">'''Lived religion''' is the [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[Holism|holistic]] framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in [[religious studies]]. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of [[sociology of religion]] "la religion vécue."&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like [[Robert A. Orsi]] and [[David D. Hall]]. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Scholars==

===Robert Orsi===
[[Robert A. Orsi]] is Professor of Religious Studies and History and Grace Craddock Nagle Chair in Catholic Studies at [[Northwestern University]]. He researches, writes, and teaches about religion in the United States, in the past and in contemporary contexts, with a particular focus on American Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.weinberg.northwestern.edu/orsi/&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi’s book ''The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950'', won several prizes including the Jesuit National Book Award and is an example study of lived religion.

Orsi defines lived religion as including “the work of social agents/actors themselves as narrators and interpreters (and reinterpreters) of their own experiences and histories, recognizing that the stories we tell about others exist alongside the many and varied story they tell of them selves”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi understands lived religion to be centered on the actions and interpretations of religious person.

In order to study and write about lived religion Orsi suggests a broad field of study in terms of topic matter and methodology. Orsi describes his own process of studying lived religion for ''Madonna On 115th Street'' as wide in scope: “I came to realize that I was learning as much from how people were to me as from what they were telling me, as much as what was going on around the stories as from the stories themselves.” &lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a narrow archival study, Orsi’s focus on non-traditional forms of research demands that scholars give attention to institutions ''and'' persons, texts ''and'' rituals, practices ''and'' theology, things and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; In order to study lived religion, Orsi advocates for a complex academic lens where almost anything can hold meaning and serve as a source or text for study.   [[File:La Madonna col Bambino.JPG|thumb|La Madonna col Bambino]]

In ''The Madonna Of 115th Street'', Orsi studies the lived religion of Catholic Italian immigrants in [[Harlem]] New York. Orsi focuses on a particular religious celebration known as the [[Feast day|festa]] for [[The Madonna]] and the social structures that create and layer the event. Through observations, story telling, conversations and research Orsi weaves a picture of life for this immigrant community. In his book, Orsi explores and explains various internal traditions, cultures, and power and social dynamicss in order to illustrate the various religious meanings and significance for community in Italian Harlem.

Orsi talks about the importance of dynamic subject matter covered by the study of lived religion: “the study of lived religion is shaped by and shapes the way family life is organized, for instance; how the dead are buried, children disciplined, the past and present imagined, moral boundaries established and challenged, home constructed, maintained and destroyed, the gods and spirits worshiped and importuned and so on”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orsi's critique of popular religion===

Orsi critiques popular religion as being a limited framework and method for studying religion. Orsi claims that popular religion is “unclear, misleading, and tendentious”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi notes that popular religion is concerned only with the practices of “common folk” and distinguishing popular religion practices as separate from “official religion”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to The Madonna on 115th Street, he writes, “popular religion served to seal off certain expressions of religious life from unspecified but obviously normative religion”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi is concerned with the limitations of popular religions because he sees it as potentially authorizing legitimacy and boundaries in religious practices and beliefs. For Orsi, the implied intent in popular religion is to highlight the primitive, ignorant, and often marginalized practitioners of popular religion as a means of “policing religion”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi’s scholarly move to lived religion as a theoretical framework was an attempt to provide a more holistic approach to religious studies and also highlights the perspective that “religious practices and understandings only have meaning in relations to other cultural forms and in relations to the life experiences and actual circumstance of the people using them”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

===David D. Hall===
[[David D. Hall]] has been a faculty member at [[Harvard Divinity School]] since 1989. Hall was Bartlett Professor of New England Church History until 2008, when he became Bartlett Research Professor.&lt;ref&gt;http://hds.harvard.edu/people/david-d-hall&lt;/ref&gt; Hall writes extensively on religion and society in seventeenth-century New England and England. Hall edited a series of essays titled ''Lived Religion In America: Toward a History Of Practice'', which is a foundational compilation in the study of lived religion. Hall’s book covers topics including gift exchange, cremation, hymn singing and many other essays on lived and practiced religious belief. Many of Hall's students have gone on to become notable scholars in the field of lived religion.

Hall defines lived religion as “rooted less in sociology than cultural and ethnographical approaches to the study of religion and American religious history.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;   He instead sees lived religion as the study of the context and content about the practices of religious laity and their “everyday thinking.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall believes that using lived religion as an approach to the study of religion allows for a wider interpretation of meaning and also provides an opportunity for historians to examine the past and present from many angles. For Hall, lived religion “does not depend on any single method or discipline.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall also acknowledges the limitations of lived religion. Hall suggests that as a field, lived religion is “fluid, mobile, and incompletely structured.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. xii,quoting Danièle Hervieu-Léger&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall calls lived religion an “imperfect tool” noting that even with a dynamic study of laity it is impossible to fully understand any one person’s religious practices, especially when summarizing from a single location be it time or place.

===Hall's critique of popular religion===
Hall distinguishes the study of lived religion from popular religion by saying that popular religion is concerned with hierarchy and opposition in religious beliefs and practices. Hall writes, “popular religion has therefore come to signify the space that emerged between official or learned Christianity and the profane (or ‘pagan’) culture.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall critiques popular religion as imposing normative perspectives on practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6648">'''Magis Institute''' is a non-profit educational organization founded by Jesuit priest and former [[Gonzaga University]] president [[Robert Spitzer, SJ|Robert J. Spitzer, SJ]].  The institute's primary outreaches are the [[Magis]] Center of Reason and Faith and the Magis Center for Catholic Spirituality.

== Founder ==
{{main|Robert Spitzer, SJ}}

'''Robert J. Spitzer''' [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] (b. May 16, 1952) is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[priest]], philosopher, educator, author, speaker, and retired President of [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].   Father Spitzer is founder and currently active as President of Magis Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to public education concerning the complementary relationship among the varied disciplines of physics, philosophy, reason, and faith.  He is also the Chief Education Officer of the Ethics and Performance Institute which delivers web-based ethics education to corporations and individuals. He is also President of the Spitzer Center of Ethical Leadership, which delivers similar curricula to non-profit organizations.

== The Magis Center for Reason and Faith ==
Magis Institute originally was created to be only a center for Catholic spirituality.  In 2008, Father Spitzer and his associates at Magis considered how they might offer a reasoned, scientific alternative viewpoint to those publicly expressed by "[[new atheism]]" writers such as [[Christopher Hitchins]] and [[Richard Dawkins]].  As a result of these conversations, Father Spitzer began the [http://magiscenter.com/ Magis Center for Reason and Faith] to provide a framework for the creation and distribution of materials expressing this alternative viewpoint.

On 3 September 2010, the Catholic News Agency featured Magis founder Father Spitzer in their response to the announcement of Stephen Hawking's new book touching on the subject of the origins of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawking's new book does not dismiss the real God from creation, Jesuit scholars say'' CNA, retrieved 8 Sept 2010 from http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/hawkings-new-book-does-not-dismiss-the-real-god-from-creation-jesuit-scholars-say/&lt;/ref&gt;  Online magazine "The Blaze" also featured a response to Hawking from Father Spitzer:  "There are already numerous video responses to Hawking popping up on YouTube. Let’s pick one.  Here is former Gonzaga University President Father Robert Spitzer who now heads the Magis Center of Reason and Faith"&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Scott.  ''Religious Leaders Respond to Hawking's 'No Need for God' ''The Blaze, 5 September 2010 retrieved on 8 September 2010 from http://www.theblaze.com/stories/religious-leaders-respond-to-hawkings-no-need-for-god-argument/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2010, the institute was prominently mentioned on the CNN program ''[[Larry King Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript link: http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1009/10/lkl.01.html&lt;/ref&gt; Father Spitzer appeared as a panelist on the program which featured Dr. [[Stephen Hawking]], Hawking's literary collaborator, [[Leonard Mlodinow]], and author [[Deepak Chopra]] in a one-hour prime-time discussion on the need for a transcendent creator of the universe.

== Methods ==
The institute, through Magis Center for Reason and Faith, is using five methods to leverage media to publicize their view of the compatibility of faith and reason:

=== Books ===
Father Spitzer has published ''New Proofs for the Existence of God''&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Robert J, SJ. ''New Proofs for the Existence of God'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The books authored by members of the institute will be "affordable (under $30.00 US for the most part) and tailored for the average reader within the planned demographic. The institute also helps to promote the books of other writers who share a similar viewpoint, e.g. William Lane Craig, working with a physicist named Simpson, published the ''Blackwell Commentary on Natural Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;Eds. Craig and Moreland.  ''The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'' (John Wiley and Sons, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentary films ===
The institute hired Martha Cotton, former producer of NBC News and the ''Today Show'', who has written a script that made these complex issues more intelligible, with the goal of bringing the discussion to the level of a high school student. Planned for a 2011 release, the first documentary features Nobel Laureate Arno Penzias, who discovered background radiation from the Big Bang. A Templeton Prize winner, John Polkinghorne, who is also an Anglican priest, is featured as well.  The feature is completed and distribution is being negotiated (as of March 2011).

=== New media ===
The institute is reaching out via the World Wide Web, and to the blogosphere; it has a popular Facebook page, and also releases frequent videos via YouTube.  The institute provides information concerning the long history of scientific research done by members of the clergy over the centuries with a special focus on those who are currently active in their respective fields both on Facebook and its website.

=== High school curriculum ===
The institute has planned the release in September 2011 of a curriculum aimed at the high school student, and designed for use in parochial schools and church youth groups..

=== Adult education and college curricula ===
Catalogued for the Fall (September) of 2011, there is a college course in conjunction with [[Benedictine College]] in Atchison, Kansas numbered GS298 and titled "Physics and Metaphysics in Dialogue". The course will carry 3 semester credits and will be transferable as elective credit to any regionally accredited institution of higher education.

Adult Curricula for group settings or individual study, with less scope and depth than the college course, are also to be released in September 2011.

'''Monopsychism''' is the belief that all humans share the same eternal [[consciousness]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[mind]] and [[intellect]].  It is also a recurring feature in many [[Mysticism|mystical traditions]].

Monopsychism is a doctrine of [[Sabians|Sabianism]], Jewish [[Kabbalah]], and [[Averroism]], and also forms a part of the [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] belief system.

==Aquinas==
[[Thomas Aquinas]] disagreed with this belief and devoted most of his writing to Averroism and criticized monopsychism. One of his works, a commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On the soul]]'', is titled ''De unitate intellectus contra Averroistas''.&lt;ref&gt;http://dhspriory.org/thomas/DeUnitateIntellectus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In this commentary, Aquinas demonstrates how [[Averroes]] misinterpreted Aristotle's argument, claiming that the correct interpretation was that an individual's [[nous|intellect]] cannot be independent of his or her physical body.

{{quote|''(...) intellect, can be separated, not indeed from body, as the Commentator'' (Averroes) ''perversely interprets, but from other parts of the soul'' (...)|Aquinas}}

The [[murder]] of human beings for their body parts is a [[crime]] in all countries. Such practices have been confirmed or suspected to occur within a handful of contexts.

Medicine murder (not to be confused with "medical murder" due to [[medical negligence]]) means the killing of a human being in order to excise body parts to use as medicine or for [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] purposes in [[witchcraft]]. Medicine murder is not viewed as a form of [[human sacrifice]] in a religious sense, because the motivation is not the death of a human or the effecting of magical changes through the death of a human being, but the obtaining of an item or items from their [[corpse]] to be used in [[traditional medicine]]. Its practice in the format described below occurs primarily in sub-equatorial [[Africa]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Medicine murder in [[southern Africa]] has been documented in some small detail in [[South Africa]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]], although it is a difficult subject to investigate because of its controversial standing in customary practices and laws. Very few research and discussion documents have been devoted to this subject. Three concerning Lesotho were published in 1951, 2000 and 2005 regarding the same events in the 1940s and 1950s; one concerning Swaziland was published in 1993 covering the 1970s and 1980s; and a commission of enquiry held in South Africa in 1995 covering medicine murder and witchcraft in the 1980s and 1990s.

The [[illegal organ trade]] has at times led to murder for body parts, because of a worldwide demand of [[organ transplant|organs for transplant]] and [[organ donor]]s. At times, [[criminal organization]]s have engaged in [[kidnap]]ping people, especially children and teens, with the victims being killed and their organs harvested for the illegal organ trade.&lt;ref name="mexico.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2014/03/17/la-policia-detiene-a-manuel-plancarte-sobrino-de-un-lider-templario|title=La policía detiene a Manuel Plancarte, sobrino de un líder 'templario'|date=17 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2583135/Cartel-member-accused-kidnapping-children-harvest-organs-captured-Mexico.html|title=Knights Templar cartel member accused of kidnapping children is captured - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent is unknown, and non-fatal organ theft and removal is more widely reported than murder.

In 2006, [[China]] was [[Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China|reported to be using]] its extensive pool of [[Falun Gong]] [[political prisoner]]s as a supply for body parts to be used in transplants. The allegations and supporting testimony were raised in several countries and seen as deeply disturbing. Reports&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;&lt;ref name=BE/&gt;&lt;ref name=SO/&gt;&lt;ref name=TS/&gt; and testimony found that such prisoners were routinely assessed for transplants and apparent [[tissue typing]], in a manner with no relevance to ordinary patient wellbeing, and that many were subsequently executed to meet demand for matching organs. Data on availability and speed of transplants within China (under 2 – 3 weeks in some cases compared to years elsewhere) led several renowned doctors to state that the statistics and transplant rates seen would be impossible without access to a very large pool of pre-existing donors already available on very short notice for hearts and other organs; several governments also established restrictions intended to target such a practice.&lt;ref name=Efforts&gt;David Kilgour [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/4257-international-efforts-to-stop-forced-organ-harvesting-from-falun-gong-in-china International Efforts to Stop Forced Organ Harvesting From Falun Gong in China] Epoch Times 9 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; China denied such practices.

Historically, [[anatomy murder]]s took place during the earlier parts of modern Western medicine. In the 19th century, the human body was still poorly understood, but fresh [[cadaver]]s for [[dissection]] and anatomical study were sometimes difficult to obtain. Mortuaries remained the most common source, but in some cases, such as the notorious [[Irish people|Irish]] murderers [[Burke and Hare]], victims were killed instead and the killers then sold the bodies for study. The practice has intermittently been reported since that time; in 1992 [[Colombia]]n [[activist]] Juan Pablo Ordoñez, claimed that 14 poor residents of the town of [[Barranquilla]] had been killed for local medical study&lt;ref&gt;Mary Roach (2003).

==Medicine murder==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2015}}

===Purpose and frequency===
The objective of medicine murder is to create traditional medicine based partly on human flesh. Medicine murder is often termed [[ritual murder]] or [[Muti|muthi / muti murder]], although there is evidence to suggest that the degree of [[ritual]] involved in the making of medicine is only a small element of the practice overall. Social anthropological ethnographies have documented anecdotes of medicine murder in southern Africa since the 1800s, and research has shown that incidences of medicine murder increase in times of political and economic stress.

The practice is commonly associated with [[witchcraft]], although ethnographic evidence suggests that this has not always been the case, and that it may have been accorded local-level political sanction. Medicine murder is difficult to describe concisely, as it has changed over time, involving an ever-greater variety of perpetrator, victim, method and motive. Most detailed information about the minutiae of medicine murder is derived from state witnesses in trials, court records and third-party anecdote.

The phenomenon is widely acknowledged to occur in southern Africa, although no country has issued an accurate and up to date record of the frequency with which it takes place. This is not only because of the secrecy of the practice, given its controversial status, but also because of difficulties in classifying subcategories of murder. Medicine murder has been a topic of urban legends in South Africa, but this does not diminish its status as a practice that has resulted in legal trials and convictions of perpetrators.

===Methodology===
The perpetrators are usually men, although women have been convicted as well, most notably in [[Swaziland]] when Phillippa Mdluli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truecrimelibrary.com/crime_series_show.php?id=695&amp;series_number=13 |title=July 2nd Philippa Mdluli – Swaziland 2/7/1983 |work=truecrimelibrary.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005195740/http://www.truecrimelibrary.com/crime_series_show.php?id=695&amp;series_number=13 |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.times.co.sz/News/27315.html |title=Special judge to oversee hanging |work=times.co.sz |year=2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040800/http://www.times.co.sz/News/27315.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was hanged in 1983 for commissioning a medicine murder. Perpetrators vary widely in age and social status.

An individual or group of individuals commissions a traditional healer or ''[[inyanga]] / nanga '' (a herbalist skilled in traditional medicine) to assist them by concocting medicine (or muti). The medicine supposedly strengthens the 'personality' or personal force of the person who commissions the medicine. This increased personal force enables the person to excel in business, politics, or other sphere of influence. A human victim is identified for murder in order to create the medicine.

Victims vary widely in age and social standing. They are often young children or elderly people, and are both male and female. In some instances, the victim is identified and 'purchased' via a transaction involving an often nominal amount of money. The victim is then abducted, often at night, and taken to an isolated place, often in the open countryside if the murder is being committed in a rural area. It is usually intended that the victim be mutilated while conscious, so that the medicine can be made more potent through the noises of the victim in agony. Mutilation does not take place in order to kill the victim, but it is expected that the victim will die of the wounds.

Body parts excised mostly include soft tissue&amp;nbsp;– eyelids, lips, [[Scrotum|scrota]], [[Labium (genitalia)|labia]]&amp;nbsp;– although there have been instances where entire limbs have been severed. These body parts are removed to be mixed with medicinal plants to create a medicine through a cooking process. The resulting medicine is sometimes consumed, but is often made into a paste that is carried on the person of the perpetrator or rubbed onto scarifications.

=== Variances ===
Since the 1970s, the manner in which medicine murder is practiced has become altered to the methods described above, although the continued practice of medicine murder demonstrates that belief in human flesh as a powerful medicinal component remains strong in some communities.   It would appear that medicine murder in the 18th and 19th centuries may have been considered the legitimate domain of traditional chiefs and leaders, in order to improve agriculture and protect against war (see [[Human sacrifice]]).

Following industrialisation and growth of commerce, the range of purposes for which medicine was used to increase influence expanded significantly. In the early 1990s when [[South Africa]] was experiencing internal political strife between several political groupings, it became clear that some mutilations for medicine were opportunistic and incidental to the assassination of political opponents. There have also been occurrences of mutilation of corpses in medical facilities. In not all cases does the employment of a traditional healer seem to have been thought necessary to the process.

===Notable cases===

==== 1994 Segametsi Mogomotsi case====
In 1994, a 14-year-old named [[Murder of Segametsi Mogomotsi|Segametsi Mogomotsi]] was murdered in [[Mochudi]], [[Botswana]] and body parts removed. The killing was widely believed to have been for muti, and the police even recovered some excised organs. However, these were destroyed before being tested to establish them as human, leading to accusations of police complicity with the murder. The killing led to riots as students in Mochudi protested about police inaction, and eventually [[Scotland Yard]] from [[UK|Britain]] were asked to investigate, as neutral outsiders. Their report was given to the Botswana government, which did not release it to the public. These events inspired some of the events in the book ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'' by [[Alexander McCall Smith]].

====2001 Thames torso case====
{{main|Adam (murder victim)}}
A little boy whose headless and limbless body was found floating in the [[Thames]] in 2001 was identified by an arrestee in March 2011.
The five-year-old’s identity has remained a mystery after he was smuggled into Britain and murdered in a voodoo-style ritual killing.
He was drugged with a ‘black-magic’ potion and sacrificed before being thrown into the Thames, where his torso washed up next to the Globe Theatre in September 2001.
Detectives used pioneering scientific techniques to trace radioactive isotopes in his bones to his native [[Nigeria]].
They even enlisted Nelson Mandela to appeal for information about the murder.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2002-04-19/world/mandela.muti_1_muti-body-parts-victims?_s=PM:WORLD CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

They struggled to formally identify the boy, whom they called Adam, despite travelling to the West African state to try to trace his family.
Nigerian Joyce Osiagede, the only person to be arrested in Britain as part of the inquiry, has claimed that the victim's real name is Ikpomwosa.
In an interview with ITV’s ''London Tonight'', Mrs Osiagede said she looked after the boy in Germany for a year before travelling to Britain without him in 2001.
She claimed she handed the boy over to a man known as Bawa who later told her that he was dead and threatened to kill her unless she kept silent.

Police have passed numerous files on the case to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] but it has never gone to court.
A second suspect, a Nigerian man, was arrested in Dublin in 2003 but was never charged.
Mrs Osiagede was first questioned by police after they found clothing similar to that worn by ‘Adam’ in her Glasgow tower-block flat in 2002.
The only clothing on his body was a pair of orange shorts, exclusively sold in Woolworths in Germany and Austria.
Dressed in a traditional gold and green dress, Mrs Osiagede denied any involvement with the death of the young boy.

Asked who killed him, she said a ‘group of people’.
She added: "They used him for a ritual in the water."
Claiming the boy was six years old, she said: ‘He was a lively boy. A very nice boy, he was also intelligent.’
Detailed analysis of a substance in the boy’s stomach was identified as a ‘black magic’ potion.
It included tiny clay pellets containing small particles of pure gold, an indication that Adam was the victim of a [[Muti]] ritual killing in which it is believed that the body parts of children are sacred. Bodies are often disposed of in flowing water.

==== 2009 Masego Kgomo case ====
[[Murder of Masego Kgomo|Masego Kgomo]] was a 10-year-old South African girl whose body parts were removed and sold to a [[sangoma]] in [[Soshanguve]], [[South Africa]]. The little girl's body was found in bushes near the Mabopane railway station, north-west of [[Pretoria]]. Thirty-year-old Brian Mangwale was found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life sentence for muti killer|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Life-sentence-for-muti-killer-20111128-4|accessdate=8 June 2014|newspaper=News24|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illegal organ trade murders (the 'Red trade')==
{{main|Illegal organ trade}}

According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), illegal organ trade occurs when organs are removed from the body for the purpose of commercial transactions.&lt;ref name="Jafar" /&gt; The illegal organ trade is growing, and a recent report by [[Global Financial Integrity]] estimates that globally it generates profits between $0.6 billion and $1.2 billion per year

In some cases, criminal organizations have engaged in kidnapping of people, especially children and teens, who are [[murder]]ed and their [[organ harvesting|organs harvested]] for profit.&lt;ref name="mexico.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; In 2014 an alleged member of the Mexican Knights Templar cartel was arrested for the kidnapping and deaths of minors, after children were found wrapped in blankets and stuffed in a refrigerated container inside a van.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/03/mexico-cartel-member-held-organ-theft-case-201431821815141191.html|title=Mexico cartel member held in organ theft case|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/17/cartel-mexico-organ-trafficking/6548691/|title=Police nab cartel member in organ trafficking case|author=AP|date=17 March 2014|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the most recent [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]] on the state of the international organ trade,{{when|date=August 2014}} 66,000 kidney transplants, 21,000 liver transplants, and 6000 heart transplants were performed globally in 2005,&lt;ref name="Shimazono"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shimazono |first=Yosuke |title=The State of the International Organ Trade: A Provisional Picture Based on Integration of Available Information |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=85 |issue=12 |year=2007 |doi=10.1590/S0042-96862007001200017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while another article reports that 2008 the median waiting time for the U.S. transplant list in 2008 was greater than 3 years and expected to rise, while the [[United Kingdom]] reported a lack of organs for 8000 patients, with the rate increasing at 8%.&lt;ref name="Jafar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jafar |first=Tazeen H. |title=Organ Trafficking: Global Solutions for a Global Problem |journal=[[American Journal of Kidney Diseases]] |volume=54 |issue=6 |year=2009 |doi=10.1053/j.ajkd.2009.08.014 |pmid= |pages=1145–1157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that about 10% of all transplants occur illegally, with the [[Internet]] acting as a facilitator. [[Transplant tourism]] raises concerns because it involves the transfer of healthy organs in one direction, depleting the regions where organs are bought. This transfer typically occurs from South to North, developing to developed nations, females to males, and from people of color to whites, a trend that experts say "has exacerbated old...divisions".&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scheper-Hughes |first=Nancy |title=The Last Commodity: Post-Human Ethics, Global (In)Justice, and the Traffic in Organs |location=Penang |publisher=Multiversity &amp; Citizens International |year=2008 |isbn=9789833302093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some organs such as the [[kidney]] can be transplanted routinely and the single remaining kidney is adequate for normal human needs, other organs are less easy to source. Liver transplants in particular are prominent, but incur an excruciating recovery that deters donations.{{Clarify|reason=what is the relevance to this section?|date=October 2015}}

Most countries have laws which criminalize the buying and selling of organs, or the carrying out of medical procedures for the illegal organ trade.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Capital punishment and organ harvesting in China ==
{{see also|Kilgour–Matas report|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China}}
In March 2006, three individuals alleged that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed at [[Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital]], to supply China's organ transplant industry.&lt;ref name=SCCC&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-3-10/39083.html "Secret Chinese Concentration Camp Revealed"] 10 March 2006 The Epoch Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NW&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-3-17/39405.html "New Witness Confirms Existence of Chinese Concentration Camp, Says Organs Removed from Live Victims"] 17 March 2006 The Epoch Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=36cc&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-3-31/39910.html "Source Reveals Other Chinese Concentration Camps, Sujiatun is merely one of 36 concentration camps for Falun Gong in China"] 31 March 2006 The Epoch Times&lt;/ref&gt; The third person, a doctor, said the so-called hospitals in Sujiatun are but one of 36 similar concentration camps all over China.&lt;ref name=36cc/&gt;

The allegations were the subject of investigative reports by [[Edward McMillan-Scott]],&lt;ref&gt;Edward McMillan-Scott (7 July 2006) [http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-7-7/43653.html EP Vice-President's Investigative Report on Organ Harvesting in China] The Epoch Times&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-President of the European Parliament, and by former Canadian Secretary of State [[David Kilgour]] and human rights lawyer [[David Matas]].&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;

The report called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—noting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand. A significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponded with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year.

== Murder for dissection and study==
{{main|Anatomy murder}}
An anatomy murder (sometimes called '''burking''' in [[British English]]) is a murder committed in order for all or part of the cadaver to be used for medical research or teaching.  It is not a [[medicine murder]] because the body parts are not believed to have any medicinal use in themselves. The motive for the murder is created by the demand for cadavers for dissection, and the opportunity to learn anatomy and physiology as a result of the dissection.  Rumors concerning the prevalence of anatomy murders are associated with the rise in demand for cadavers in research and teaching produced by the [[Scientific Revolution]].  During the nineteenth century, the sensational [[serial murders]] associated with [[Burke and Hare]] and the [[London Burkers]] led to legislation which provided scientists and medical schools with legal ways of obtaining cadavers.  Rumors persist that anatomy murders are carried out wherever there is a high demand for cadavers.  These rumors are hard to substantiate, and may reflect continued, deep-held fears of the use of cadavers as commodities.

[[Image:Nakchong.jpg|thumb|Nakchhong, the kirat priest.]]
'''Nakchhong''' (नाक्छोङ) are priests of the [[Kirati]] people, an ethnic group that is predominantly located in the [[Himalayas]].  

Nakchhong maintain a [[vegetarian]] diet as part of their spiritual regime.  The Kirati believe that Nakchhong are chosen bodies of good spirits.  One of the foremost Kirat, Mundhum, has taught that there are two types of spirits.  Rumahang, the divine spirit, is a supreme spirit who created the universe and living beings on this earth.  Rumahang represents truth, happiness, compassion and love.  Conversely, the devil spirit represents destruction, jealousy and hatred. Thus, Nakchhong act under Rumahang against the devil spirits.  

Those who possess a magical weapon (any kind of BAN to harm or kill another) are regarded as chosen bodies of the devil spirit.  On the other hand, Nakchhong do not have any magical weapons to harm or kill other living beings.

Nakchhong frequently work with the following materials:
*[[Aduwa (Kirat culture)|Aduwa]] (ginger)
*[[Pokhemma]]
*[[Tupla (Kirat culture)|Tupla]] (cut pieces of the front part of a banana leaf)
*Chindo: Gourd filled with [[Jand (Kirat culture)|Jand]] (millet beer)

{{Irreligion sidebar|expanded=nontheism}}
'''Nontheistic religions''' are traditions of [[religious belief|thought]] within a [[religion | religious context]]—some otherwise aligned with [[theism]], others not—in which [[nontheism]] informs religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=  Williams|first= J. Paul|author2= Horace L. Friess|authorlink2=Horace L. Friess |title= The Nature of Religion|journal= Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year= 1962|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 3–17|jstor= 1384088|publisher= Blackwell Publishing|doi= 10.2307/1384088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nontheism has been applied{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} to the fields of [[Christian apologetics]] and general [[liberal theology]], and plays significant roles in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Satanism]]. While many approaches to religion exclude nontheism by definition, some inclusive definitions of religion show how religious practice and belief do not depend on the presence of god(s). For example, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Peter Mandaville]] distinguish between religion and [[spirituality]], but provide a definition of the term that avoids the usual reduction to "religions of the book":

{{quote|Religion can be defined as a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is lived as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Existence of gods ===
{{See also|God in Buddhism}}

The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] said that ''[[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]]'' (translated as "gods") do exist, but they were regarded as still being trapped in ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thirty-one planes of Existence|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html|publisher=Access To Insight|accessdate=May 26, 2010|author=John T Bullitt|year=2005|quote=The suttas describe thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during this long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily dark, grim, and painful hell realms to the most sublime, refined, and exquisitely blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is impermanent; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to both their past kamma and their kamma at the moment of death. When the kammic force that propelled them to that realm is finally exhausted, they pass away, taking rebirth once again elsewhere according to their kamma. And so the wearisome cycle continues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are not necessarily wiser than we. In fact, the Buddha is often portrayed as a teacher of the gods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teacher of the Devas|year=1997|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html|author=Susan Elbaum Jootla|editor=Access To Insight|location=Kandy, Sri Lanka|chapter=II. The Buddha Teaches Deities|quote="Many people worship Maha Brahma as the supreme and eternal creator God, but for the Buddha he is merely a powerful deity still caught within the cycle of repeated existence. In point of fact, "Maha Brahma" is a role or office filled by different individuals at different periods." "His proof included the fact that "many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama" (MN 95.9). Devas, like humans, develop faith in the Buddha by practicing his teachings." "A second deva concerned with liberation spoke a verse which is partly praise of the Buddha and partly a request for teaching. Using various similes from the animal world, this god showed his admiration and reverence for the Exalted One.", "A discourse called Sakka's Questions (DN 21) took place after he had been a serious disciple of the Buddha for some time. The sutta records a long audience he had with the Blessed One which culminated in his attainment of stream-entry. Their conversation is an excellent example of the Buddha as "teacher of devas," and shows all beings how to work for Nibbana."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Kevaddha Sutta|year=1997|publisher=Access To Insight|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html#bigbrahma|authorlink=Digha Nikaya, 11|quote=When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be... That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However he answers it, you should take it to heart.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time of the Buddha, the denial of the existence of a [[creator deity]] has been seen as a key point in distinguishing Buddhist from non-Buddhist views.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''Contemplative Science.'' Columbia University Press, 2007, pages 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of an independent creator deity was answered by the Buddha in the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]]. The Buddha denounced the view of a creator and sees that such notions are related to the false view of [[Sassatavada|eternalism]], and like the 61 other views, this belief causes [[Dukkha|suffering]] when one is [[Upādāna|attached]] to it and states these views may lead to desire, aversion and delusion. At the end of the Sutta the Buddha says he knows these 62 views and he also knows the truth that surpasses them.

===Metaphysical questions===
On one occasion, when presented with a problem of [[metaphysics]] by the monk Malunkyaputta, the Buddha responded with the [[Parable of the Poison Arrow]]. When a man is shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poison, his family summons the doctor to have the poison removed, and the doctor gives an antidote:&lt;ref name=hanh&gt;{{cite book

|year=1991
|pages=299
|isbn=0-938077-26-0
|publisher=Parallax Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But the man refuses to let the doctor do anything before certain questions can be answered.  The wounded man demands to know who shot the arrow, what his caste and job is, and why he shot him.  He wants to know what kind of bow the man used and how he acquired the ingredients used in preparing the poison.  Malunkyaputta, such a man will die before getting the answers to his questions.  It is no different for one who follows the Way.  I teach only those things necessary to [[Bodhi|realize the Way]].  Things which are not helpful or necessary, I do not teach.}}

== Christianity ==
 {{Main|Secular theology|Christian atheism}}
A few [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] [[theologians]], define a "nontheistic God" as "the ground of all being" rather than as a personal [[divinity|divine]] [[being]]. [[John Shelby Spong]] refers to a theistic God as "a personal being with expanded supernatural, human, and parental qualities, which has shaped every religious idea of the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;''A New Christianity for a New World: Why Traditional Faith Is Dying and How a New Faith Is Being Born'', {{ISBN|0-06-067063-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a nontheist, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]], and [[rationalism|rationalist]] perspective, the concept of divine grace appears to be the same concept as [[luck]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Arnold S. "Ability", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 60, No. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bust of Paul Johannes Tillich (daylight).JPG|170px|thumb|right|Bust of [[Paul Tillich]]]]
	
Many of them owe much of their [[theology]] to the work of Christian existentialist [[philosopher]] [[Paul Tillich]], including the phrase "the ground of all being". Another quotation from Tillich is, "God does not exist. He is being itself beyond essence and existence. Therefore to argue that God exists is to deny him."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, Paul. (1951) ''Systematic Theology'', p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; This Tillich quotation summarizes his conception of God. He does not think of God as a being that exists in time and space, because that constrains God, and makes God finite. But all beings are finite, and if God is the Creator of all beings, God cannot logically be finite since a finite being cannot be the sustainer of an infinite variety of finite things. Thus God is considered beyond being, above finitude and limitation, the power or essence of being itself. 

===Nontheist Quakers=== 
[[File:Nontheist.JPG|thumb|150px|Logo of the Society of Nontheist Friends]]
{{Main|Nontheist Quakers}}
A nontheist Friend or an atheist Quaker is someone who affiliates with, identifies with, engages in and/or affirms [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] practices and processes, but who does not accept a belief in a theistic understanding of [[God]], a Supreme Being, the [[divinity|divine]], the [[soul]] or the [[supernatural]]. Like theistic Friends, nontheist Friends are actively interested in realizing centered [[peace]], simplicity, integrity, community, equality, [[love]], [[happiness]] and [[social justice]] in the Society of Friends and beyond.

== Hinduism ==
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
Hinduism is characterised by extremely diverse beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[R.C. Zaehner]], "it is perfectly possible to be a good Hindu whether one's personal views incline toward [[monism]], [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], or even [[atheism]]."&lt;ref name="Catherine Robinson 1992, page 51"&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that it is a religion that neither depends on the existence or non-existence of God or Gods.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Zaehner, (1966) ''Hinduism'', P.1-2, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, Hinduism can be seen as having three more important strands: one featuring a personal Creator or Divine Being, one that emphasises an impersonal Absolute and a third that is pluralistic and non-absolute. The latter two traditions can be seen as nontheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Paul J, (2005) ''Nontheistic Conceptions of the Divine'' Ch. 3. in  T''he Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion'' by William J Wainwright, p.59 . Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|0-19-513809-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Vedas are broadly concerned with the completion of ritual, there are some elements that can be interpreted as either nontheistic or precursors to the later developments of the nontheistic tradition. The oldest Hindu scripture, the [[Rig Veda]] mentions that 'There is only one god though the sages may give it various names' (1.164.46). [[Max Müller]] termed this [[henotheism]], and it can be seen as indicating one, non-dual divine reality, with little emphasis on personality.&lt;ref&gt;Masih, Y. A comparative study of religions, P.164, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2000 {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Nasadiya Sukta]], the 129th Hymn of the tenth and final Mandala (or chapter) of the Rig Veda,  considers creation and asks "The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. /Who then knows whence it has arisen?".&lt;ref&gt;O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, (1981)''The Rig Veda: An Anthology of One Hundred Eight Hymns'' (Classic) Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen to contain the intuition that there must be a single principle behind all phenomena: 'That one' (tad ekam), self-sufficient, to which distinctions cannot be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Collinson, Diané and Wilkinson, Robert Thirty-Five Oriental Philosophers, P. 39, Routledge, 1994 {{ISBN|0-415-02596-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, Jitendranath (2000), Classical Indian Philosophy: An Introductory Text, p:1 Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|0-8476-8933-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is with the [[Upanishads]], reckoned to be written in the first millennia (coeval with the ritualistic [[Brahmanas]]), that the Vedic emphasis on ritual was challenged. The Upanishads can be seen as the expression of new sources of power in India. Also, separate from the Upanishadic tradition were bands of wandering ascetics called Vadins whose largely nontheistic notions rejected the notion that religious knowledge was the property of the Brahmins.

Routledge Press, 1992, page 45, 98, 115, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; and by others who stress its theistic message.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, pages 47, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; These broadly either follow after either [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] or [[Ramanuja]]&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin D, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', (pps 239-234) CUP, {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a nontheistic passage might be "The supreme Brahman is without any beginning. That is called neither being nor non-being," which Sankara interpreted to mean that Brahman can only be talked of in terms of negation of all attributes—'Neti neti'.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Gambhirananda, (1995), [http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/ ''Bhagavadgita: with the Commentary of Sankaracharya''], Ch. 13. Vs. 13, Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta {{ISBN|81-7505-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Advaita Vedanta]] of [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] rejects theism as a consequence of its insistence that Brahman is "Without attributes, indivisible, subtle, inconceivable, and without blemish, Brahman is one and without a second. There is nothing other than He."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, John, [http://www.realization.org/page/namedoc0/vc/vc_10.htm ''Viveka-Chudamani of Shankara'' Vs 468.]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it lacks properties usually associated with God such as omniscience, perfect goodness, omnipotence, and additionally is identical with the whole of reality, rather than being a causal agent or ruler of it.&lt;ref&gt;Wainright, William, (2006), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god/ ''Concepts of God''], Stanford Encyclopedia of Religion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Main|God in Jainism}}
{{Further|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jain texts claim that the universe consists of ''[[jiva]]'' (life force or souls) and [[ajiva]] (lifeless objects). According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents-soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion-have always existed. The universe and the matter and souls within it are eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent [[creator god]]. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings/''devas'', but these heavenly beings are not viewed as creators-they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and are portrayed as mortal.

According to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' and desires, achieves liberation/Nirvana. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from ''karmas'' and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods (''[[Tirthankara]]'').

Besides scriptural authority, Jains also employ [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute [[creationism|creationist]] theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|vedics]], [[samkhya|sāmkhyas]], mimimsas, Buddhists, and other school of thoughts were criticized by Jain Ācāryas, such as [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]].

==Satanism==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Lucien Greaves, the founder of [[the Satanic Temple]], argues that contemporary [[Satanism]] is "the future of religion" insofar as it offers a model for how religious traditions can evolve and be maintained without the need for the supernatural, as cultural and philosophical identities that inform the narratives and the rituals of individuals adherents and communities. His organization challenges the traditional view that [[religion]] must incorporate supernatural claims.

==Others==
Philosophical models not falling within established religious structures, such as [[Daoism]], Confucianism,  [[Deism]] and [[Pandeism]], have also been considered to be nontheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Numen''', pl. '''numina''',  is a [[Latin]] term for "[[divinity]]", or a "divine presence", "divine will." The Latin authors defined it as follows.&lt;ref name=lewisnumen&gt;For a more extensive account, refer to {{cite encyclopedia | author1=Charlton T. Lewis | author2=Charles Short | language=Latin | encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary | title=numen | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dnumen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] writes of a "divine mind" (''divina mens''), a god "whose numen everything obeys," and a "divine power" (''vim divinam'') "which pervades the lives of men." It causes the motions and cries of birds during augury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Cicero | title=De Divinatione | at=I.119-120 | publisher=Loeb Classical Library; penelope.uchicago.edu | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/1*.html}} {{cite web | author=Marci Tulli Ciceronis | title=De divinatione Prior | language=Latin | at=I.119-120 | publisher=The Latin Library | url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Virgil]]'s recounting of the blinding of the one-eyed giant, [[Polyphemus]], from the Odyssey, in his [[Aeneid]], he has Odysseus and his men first "ask for the assistance of the great numina" (''magna precati numina'').&lt;ref&gt;3. 634.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing public opinion of [[Augustus]] on the day of his funeral, the historian [[Tacitus]] reports that some thought "no honor was left to the gods" when he "established the cult of himself" (''se ... coli vellet'') "with temples and the effigies of numina" (''effigie numinum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=C. Cornelius Tacitus | title=Annales | at=1.10 | language=Latin | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0077%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the younger]] in a letter to Paternus raves about the "power," the "dignity," and "the majesty;" in short, the "''numen'' of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=C. Plinius Cæcilius Secundus | title=Letters | at=9.27.1 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | language=Latin | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0139%3Abook%3D9%3Aletter%3D27%3Asection%3D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucretius]] uses the expression ''numen mentis'',&lt;ref&gt;T. Lucretius Carus, ''De Natura rerum'', 3.144.&lt;/ref&gt; or "bidding of the mind,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Lucretius |title=On the Nature of Things | author2=R. Allison, Translator | publisher=Arthur Humphries | location=London | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; where "bidding" is ''numen'', not, however, the divine numen, unless the mind is to be considered divine, but as simply human will.&lt;ref name=lewisnumen/&gt;

Since the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the [[History of religions|history of religion]] as a [[animism|pre-animistic]] phase; that is, a belief system inherited from an earlier time. ''Numen'' is also used by [[sociologists]] to refer to the idea of magical power residing in an [[magical object|object]], particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, ''numen'' is nearly synonymous with ''[[mana]]''. However, some authors reserve use of ''mana'' for ideas about [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] from [[Polynesia]] and southeast [[Asia]].

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the word means "a nod of the head", here referring to a [[deity]] as it were "nodding", or making its will or its presence known). According to [[H. J. Rose]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The literal meaning is simply "a nod", or more accurately, for it is a passive formation, "that which is produced by nodding", just as ''flamen'' is "that which is produced by blowing", ''i.e.'', a gust of wind. It came to mean "the product or expression of power" — not, be it noted, power itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=H. J.|title=Primitive Culture in Italy|year=1926|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co.|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, ''numen'' (divinity) is not personified (although it can be a personal attribute) and should be distinguished from ''[[deus]]'' (god).&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bailey| first=Cyril |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |year=1907|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co Ltd| url =http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm}}, freely available from [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman cults of the numina==
Numen was also used in the [[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] of ancient Rome, to refer to the [[Genius (mythology)#Imperial genii|guardian-spirit]], 'godhead' or divine power of a living emperor—in other words, a means of worshiping a living emperor without literally calling him a god.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]] of [[Augustus]] was promoted by [[Tiberius]], who dedicated the ''Ara Numinis Augusti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title=''Genius'' and ''Numen''|journal = Harvard Theological Review|volume = 62| issue = 3| pages = 356–367| date = July 1969| doi=10.1017/s0017816000032405}} Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, a distinction can be made between the terms ''numen'' and ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title='Numina Augustorum|journal = The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series|volume = 20| issue = 1| pages = 191–197| date = May 1970| doi=10.1017/s0009838800044773}} Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition as a pre-animistic phase of religion==
The expression ''Numen inest'' appears in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' (III, 296) and has been translated as 'There is a spirit here'.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. Fasti. Translated by Frazer, James George. Loeb Classical Library Volume. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Its interpretation, and in particular the exact sense of ''numen'' has been discussed extensively in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Herbert Jennings|title=Nvmen inest: 'Animism' in Greek and Roman Religion|journal = Harvard Theological Review|volume = 28| issue = 4| pages = 237–257| date = October 1935| doi=10.1017/s0017816000023026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposition that a ''numinous presence'' in the natural world supposed in the earliest layers of [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] religion, as it were an "[[animism|animistic]]" element left over in historical Roman religion and especially in the etymology of Latin theonyms, has often been popularly implied, but was criticised as "mostly a scholarly fiction" by McGeough (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McGeough ''The Romans: new perspectives'' 2004:179 "Numinous Forces and Other scholarly Inventions"; "Scholars may have to content themselves with nodes of meanings for the Italic gods rather than hard-and-fast definitions," observes Charles Robert Phillips III, in "A Note on Vergil's Aeneid 5, 744," ''Hermes'' '''104'''.2 (1976:247–249) p. 248, with recent bibliography; Gerhard Radke's classification of the forms and significances of these multifarious names in ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' (Münster, 1965) was criticized as "unwarranted precision" in the review by A. Drummond in ''The Classical Review'', New Series, '''21'''.2 (June 1971:239–241); the coupling and uncoupling of Latin and Italic [[cognomen|cognomina]] of the gods, creating the appearance of a multitude of deities, were classically dissected in Jesse Benedictus Carter, ''De Deorum Romanorum Cognominibus: Quaestiones Selectae'' (Leipzig, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numina and specific religions==
The phrase "numen eris caeloque redux mirabere regna" appears on line 129 of the poem ''Metrum in Genesin'',&lt;ref name="KreuzPseudo-Hilary2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gottfried Kreuz|author2=Pseudo-Hilary|title=Pseudo-Hilarius Metrum in Genesin, Carmen de Evangelio: Einleitung, Text und Kommentar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaEXAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|isbn=978-3-7001-3790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to [[Hilary of Arles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pavlovskis|first=Zoja|title=The Pastoral World of Hilarius' "in Genesin"|journal = The Classical Journal|volume = 85| issue = 2| pages = 121–132| date = December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{In popular culture|date=May 2017}}
In modern times, the term (referring to the Christian God) has been used in various expressions:

The description '''person of faith''' (plural: '''people of faith''') refers to any person who can be delineated or classified by an adherence to a religious tradition or doctrine, as opposed to those who do not publicly identify or in any way espouse a religious path. The term '''people of faith''' has been increasingly used in the 20th and 21st century by religious adherents in Westernized countries who are critical of a perceived increase in public disenchantment or de-emphasis upon accommodation for religious adherents, although the term itself is used more as a catch-all term which is intentionally non-denominational or non-specific to any particular religious path.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} A person of faith is said to belong to a '''faith community''' or '''faith-based community'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=faith community|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/faith-community|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=faith-based|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith-based|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also criticized by advocates of nontheistic positions for being inaccurate in its assumption of an underlying, unifying commonality between all religious observants - despite stark doctrinal differences and oppositional stances - simply for the purpose of reducing the influence of secular-minded individuals (similar to the term [[person of color]] as a catch-all descriptor of non-white persons, or the Islamic description of [[people of the Book]] to describe the communities of adherents to Islam, Christianity and Judaism).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

A '''prayer walk''' is an activity that consists in walking and [[Prayer|praying]] at the same time. It's done not for the physical benefit but for the spiritual exercise, either publicly functioning also as a [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]] or rally (to let other people know the group is praying), or quietly in sight of the subject. For instance, a person or group may be praying for a town or city, and walk the streets of the city while praying, either out loud, or in silence.

==Defining religion and religious elements==

[[Religion]] has several definitions. [[Organized religion|Religions]] that are [[Religious organization|organized]] can be seen as [[cultural system]]s, with corresponding [[religious behaviour|behavior]] and practice. They often have [[sacred text]]s and [[holy places]]. A [[religious experience]], however, does not necessarily have to be understood through an established religious framework.

Themes and questions about life and death, innocence and guilt and violence are [[Existentialism|existential]] in nature; while they are not immediately understood as "religious", they are about the [[meaning of life]].

==Use of religious elements==

[[Video game developer]]s use religious and spiritual themes to involve the player more deeply in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Testa |first=Alessandro |date= |title= Religion(s) in Videogames Historical and Anthropological Observations |url=http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/religions/issue/view/1449/showToc |journal= Online - Heidelberg Journal of Religions on the Internet |publisher= |volume= 05 |issue= Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective and Interdisciplinary Approaches|pages= 249–276|doi= 10.11588/rel.2014.0.12170 |access-date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game developer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], who used to play outside as a child, used his experiences and memories of exploring the forest and discovering a Buddhist temple in the design of his video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/master-of-play |title= Master of Play |last1= Paumgarten |first1=Nick |date=2010-12-20 |website= [[The New Yorker]] |publisher= |access-date= 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian developer [[BioWare]] (''[[Mass Effect]]'', ''[[Dragon Age]]'') has in its offices several encyclopedias on religion, as well as the [[Book of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="Bissell"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bissell |first= Tom|authorlink=Tom Bissell|date= 2010|title= [[Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter]] |publisher= Pantheon Books|page=120 |isbn=978-0-307-37870-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative portrayal of religions has been criticized.&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/&gt;

Religious elements are used in two ways: explicit and implicit. They are seen side-by-side in video games and do not exclude each other.&lt;ref name="Understanding"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Terry Ray |last2= Clanton | first2 = Dan W. |date= 2012 |title= Understanding Religion and Popular Culture: Theories, Themes, Products and Practices|publisher= [[Routledge]]|page= 130 |isbn= 9780415781060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion in ''Mass Effect'', for instance, can be understood as an "[[unseen character]]".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Irizarry, J.A. &amp; Irizarry, I.T. The Lord is My Shepard: Confronting Religion in the Mass Effect Trilogy. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explicit narrative references===
An explicit reference to a religious or spiritual concept is one that is clear to what it is referring.&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt; These can be based upon real-world religions, but also on fictional ones. Stories, [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] and names of characters from [[religious text]]s are used as reference points.

====Ancient religions====
{{see also|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture}}
Ancient religions and their deities are used in various ways. The religions portrayed are often no longer practiced, like [[ancient Greek religion]].&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/&gt; In the real-time strategy game ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' the player has to choose a "major god", which gives certain gameplay benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-09-age-of-mythology-extended-edition-review |title=Age of Mythology: Extended Edition review |date=9 May 2014 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' the nameless Prince has to fight [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]], an evil deity from [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Crecente, B. |year=2008 |title=Prince of Persia Ditches Roots, Gets a Final Fantasy Make-Over, |accessdate=18 September 2015|url= http://kotaku.com/5011425/prince-of-persia-ditches-roots-gets-a-final-fantasy-make-over}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Events and places====
Real world historical religions and events are used as inspiration for video games. For instance, while ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2007) is [[historical fiction|fictional]], it is set during the [[Third Crusade]] in the [[Holy Land]]; the player takes on the role of the [[Assassins|Assassin]] [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] and is involved in the conflict between Catholic Christians, Orthodox Christians, Sunni Muslims and Shi'ite Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=LeJacq, Y. |year=2014 |title=Assassin's Creed Can Actually Teach You A Thing Or Two |url= http://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-can-actually-teach-you-a-thing-or-two-1576446550 |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these religions appear, they are portrayed in a "sanitized manner".&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5509058/religion-in-games-less-a-leap-of-faith-more-a-suspension-of-belief |title= Religion in Games: Less a Leap of Faith, More a Suspension of Belief |last= Good |first= Owen |date= 2010-04-04 |website= [[Kotaku]] |publisher= |access-date= 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organizations====
Religion is often institutionalized, having a certain organisational structure. Most games in the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series involve a religion, or a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5883361/the-rules-of-religion-and-why-the-next-one-just-might-be-a-game |title=The Rules of Religion, and Why The Next One Just Might Be a Game |first=Patricia |last=Hernandez |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious violence====
In the action role-playing game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' (2011) a civil war is about to erupt between the Empire and the Stormcloaks.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Thames, R. C. Religion as a Resource in Digital Games. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The Stormcloaks wish to worship Talos, a human ascended to godhood. The Empire suffered a defeat against the powerful Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance of Elves who have made the worship of Talos illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/what-happened-between-oblivion-skyrim-a-brief-history/2/ |title=What happened between Oblivion and Skyrim? Here's a brief history |first=Matt |last=Boyd |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is up to the player to help in the conflict.

===Implicit narrative references===
[[Image:Triforce.svg|thumb|right|175px|The [[Triforce]] from [[The Legend of Zelda|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]]. Based upon the concept of [[Mon (badge)|''mon'']], it is a recognizable symbol for the series]]
The stories of [[action-adventure]] and [[Role-playing video games|role-playing]] games often involve world-saving quests. The player, as the protagonist, takes on the role of the hero.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane McGonigal|McGonigal, J]] (2011). ''Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better''. Maven Publishing, Amsterdam. Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The player character is often destined to save the world, which in itself is a [[prophecy]].&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/video-game-religions-or-lack-thereof |title=Video Game Religions (or Lack Thereof) |first=Gil |last=Almogi |accessdate=2016-04-21 |date=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, A.

Immersion into the Field''. Volume 07 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' uses religious elements and motifs like the [[Triforce]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games as a religious medium==

Players and developers use games to express their existential and spiritual feelings. Video games as cultural objects can also provide religious and spiritual experiences, like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/community/2013/01/22/can-we-finally-begin-to-consider-video-games-experiences/|title=It's time we consider video games as ‘experiences,’ not mere products|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Jenova Chen]] said that "I feel that ''Journey'' is a very spiritual game. People from around the world ask me if the game has a religious connection. Many religions share an affinity with ''Journey''—this is because many religions partly share a common structure". Chen said ''Journey'' is based upon [[Joseph Campbell]]'s book on comparative mythology ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' and the [[Monomyth|"Hero's Journey"]] narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/religion-friendship-and-emotion-a-journey-post-mortem/1100-6367138/|title=Religion, friendship, and emotion: A Journey post-mortem|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/180290-journey-as-ritual/|title='Journey' As Ritual|work=[[PopMatters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Leonard Nimoy]], ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' added two statues in his honor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/06/leonard-nimoy-memorials-added-to-star-trek-online?%20|title=Leonard Nimoy Memorials Added to Star Trek Online|first=Luke|last=Karmali|date=6 March 2015|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' added a [[non-player character]] (NPC) based upon [[Robin Williams]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/robin-williams-to-be-memorialized-in-wow|title=Robin Williams to Be Memorialized in WoW|first=David|last=Witmer|date=12 August 2014|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/apparent-robin-williams-model-found-in-world-of-warcraft/|title=Apparent Robin Williams Models Found In World Of Warcraft|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Gearbox Software]] honored a late fan of ''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]'', cancer victim Michael John Mamaril, by adding a NPC named after him in [[Borderlands 2|the sequel]]. Additionally, Gearbox posted a eulogy to Mamaril in the voice of the game character Claptrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/gearbox-to-honor-late-fan-as-an-npc-in-borderlands-2-215160.phtml|title=Gearbox to honor late fan as an NPC in Borderlands 2|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|first=Tony|last=Ponce|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their game ''[[MechWarrior Online]]'', developer [[Piranha Games]] sold a custom in-game unit called a Jenner, honoring the daughter of a player of the game. [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]122,210 was donated to the Canadian Cancer Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/online-gamers-donate-122-210-in-memory-of-5-year-old-1.1302334|title=Online gamers donate $122,210 in memory of 5-year-old|date=23 August 2013|work=[[CBC.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losing his wife Pauline to ovarian cancer, ''[[Minecraft]]'' player "GasBandit" built a memorial for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/5-Touching-Memorials-Video-Games-70528-p2.html|title=5 Touching Memorials In Video Games|work=Cinema Blend|publisher=Gateway Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players of the online game ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'' heard that fellow gamer "Codex Vahla" was in the hospital on life support, they held a digital [[wake (ceremony)|wake]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, M.

===Religious video games===
{{see also|Christian video game|Islamic Fun}}
Some religious groups use video games for education. An example is the Christian game ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]''.

===Use of video games in a religious setting===
In May 2012, the [[Exeter Cathedral]] used ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]'' during its Sunday service.&lt;ref&gt;Narcisse, E. (2012) A PlayStation 3 Game Will Be Part of a Church Service This Sunday, Retrieved 15 september 2015 on http://kotaku.com/5909361/this-sunday-video-games-go-to-church&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/9/3010257/exeter-cathedral-flower-service|title=UK cathedral to use 'Flower' video game as part of upcoming service|first=Andrew|last=Webster|date=9 May 2012|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{See also|Video game controversy}}
Opinions on video games differ from religion and denomination; there are religious groups that use games actively to convert people, while some games are [[List of banned video games|banned]] for religious reasons. Scholars of religious studies are also studying video games, by looking at the game and to the players and their experiences, with games like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]''  Religion is considered a serious real world topic, while video games are an art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"/&gt; As such, developers and publishers sometimes take precaution not to offend people's religious beliefs. Religious references in the Japanese role-playing video game series ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' were originally censored for the U.S. release of the games. It was after the franchise switched to Sony's [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) that the religious references were left largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, A. The Religions Behind Final Fantasy. History of Computer Game Design: Technology, Culture, and Business March 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft's ''Assassin's Creed'' series show a disclaimer: {{blockquote| "Inspired by historical events and characters. This work of fiction was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of various religious faiths and beliefs."&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"/&gt;{{efn|In ''[[Assassin's Creed: Syndicate]]'', the words "sexual orientations and gender identities" were added.}}}}

Despite efforts from some companies, there have been incidents with religious groups and video games. The German video game rating board [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] gave ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' a 16+ rating, considering it "[[Blasphemy|blasphemous]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/182380/postmortem_mcmillen_and_himsls_.php?print=1 |title=Postmortem: McMillen and Himsl's ''The Binding of Isaac'' |last=McMillen |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund McMillen |date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' is heavily based on the notion of [[American exceptionalism]] at the turn of the 19th century, and incorporates notions taken from Christianity to support the game's dystopian themes. One aspect of this was the use of [[baptism]]. One developer on [[Irrational Games]] staff expressed strong concern to the lead developer, [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], that the game's presentation of baptism was highly controversial, leading Levine to with the developer to recast the baptism aspect as a notion of forgiveness rather than a religious tenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | title = Bioshock Infinite altered after "conversations with religious people on the team" says Levine | first = Leon | last = Hurley | date = January 18, 2013 | accessdate = January 20, 2013 | work = [[PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130122031459/http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | archivedate = January 22, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/bioshock-infinites-religious-themes-led-dev-to-consider-quitting-6404620 | title = BioShock Infinite's religious themes led dev to consider quitting | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = February 28, 2013 | accessdate = February 28, 2013 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/01/bioshock-infinite-artist-almost-resigned-over-antagonists-religious-views/ | title = BioShock Infinite artist almost resigned over game's depiction of religion | last = Petitte | first = Omri | date = March 1, 2013 | work= [[PC Gamer]] | accessdate= March 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one player objected to the final changes, prompting them to request a refund from [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name="kotaku refund"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/some-dont-like-bioshocks-forced-baptism-enough-to-as-473178476 | title = Some Don't Like BioShock's Forced Baptism.

On October 22, 2008, Microsoft announced that ''[[Fallout 3]]'' would not be released in India on the [[Xbox 360]] platform.&lt;ref name="Kotaku-India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5067039/fallout-3-not-coming-to-india |title=Fallout 3 Not Coming To India |publisher=Kotaku |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |first=Mike |last=Fahey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious and cultural sentiments were cited as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/fallout-3-withheld-from-india |title=Fallout 3 withheld from India |publisher=Games Industry |accessdate=2009-12-01 |first=Jason |last=Lee |date=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific reason was not revealed in public, it is possible that it is because the game contains two-headed mutated cows called Brahmin, or that [[Brahmin]] is also the name of an ancient, powerful hereditary caste of [[Hindu]] priests and religious scholars in India, or its similarity to the spelling of [[brahman (cattle)|brahman]], a type of cow that originated in India. Brahman, a breed of [[Zebu]], are revered by Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Are-Brahmin-The-Reason-For-Fallout-3-s-Cancellation-in-India-12947.html |title=Are Brahmin The Reason For Fallout 3's Cancellation in India? |publisher=Gaming Blend |accessdate=2011-09-04 |date=2008-10-22 |first=Pete |last=Haas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action game ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' was criticized by Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, for portraying the Hindu deity [[Hanuman]]. Developed and published in India by Aurona Technologies, the player controls Hanuman. "Controlling and manipulating Lord Hanuman with a joystick/button/keyboard/mouse [is] denigration", said Zed. "Lord Hanuman was not meant to be reduced to just a 'character' in a video game to solidify [a] company/product's base in the growing economy of India." He urged Sony, the publisher of the game, to pull the game. Sony's regional manager however said that ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' sold beyond their expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114224/Hindu_Statesman_Criticizes_Sonys_Hanuman_Boy_Warrior.php |title=Hindu Statesman Criticizes Sony's Hanuman: Boy Warrior |website=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-20 |first=Leigh |last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5217826/indias-first-game-gets-indias-first-game-controversy |title=India's First Game Gets India's First Game Controversy |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-18 |first=Owen |last=Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india/|title=Hindus Protest PS2 Game Released in India|work=GamePolitics|date=2009-04-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420175535/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india|archivedate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zed was also critical of the use of [[Hindu deities]] in the [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]''. In response, developer [[Hi-Rez Studios]] COO Todd Harris said that ''Smite'' would still be featuring Hindu deities, possibly adding more. GameSpot asked if characters based upon Abrahamic religions would be added as well, but Harris said that "the key Abrahimic figures—Adam, Noah, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, are not that interesting in character design or gameplay".&lt;ref&gt;Connor Sheridan on June 29, 2012, http://www.gamespot.com/articles/deity-based-moba-smite-will-not-use-jewish-christian-islamic-figures/1100-6384974/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
''[[LittleBigPlanet (PlayStation 3)|LittleBigPlanet]]'' (2008) had a last-minute delay involving a licensed song in the game's soundtrack,&lt;ref name=delay&gt;{{cite web| url=http://threespeech.com/blog/2008/10/littlebigplanet-scees-official-statement/|title=LittleBigPlanet – SCEE's official statement|author=Three Speech|date=17 October 2008|accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a PlayStation Community member reported the lyrics to one of the licensed songs in the game included passages from the [[Qur'an]] and could therefore be offensive to [[Muslim]]s.

The [[fighting game]] ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' was temporarily banned in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=Ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/news/10356/injustice-gods-among-us-banned-in-uae-kuwait|date=2013-04-29|accessdate=2013-05-08|last=Fakhruddin|first=Mufaddal|publisher=[[IGN|IGN Middle East]]|title=Injustice: Gods Among Us Banned in UAE, Kuwait}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/injustice-gods-among-us-video-game-not-available-in-uae|date=2013-04-30|accessdate=2013-05-08|last=Hanif|first=Nadeem|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|title='Injustice: Gods Among Us' video game not available in UAE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the title of the game was rebranded as ''Injustice: The Mighty Among Us'' for promotional uses in those areas.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt; It is speculated that ''Injustice'' was banned because of the inclusion of the word 'Gods' in the title, the cleavage exposed in the outfits of some female characters, and overall bloodiness.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt; Eventually, the ban in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was lifted.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt;

===Sikhism===
''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' (2002) sparked controversy due to a level featuring the killing of [[Sikh]]s within a depiction of their most holy site, the [[Harmandir Sahib]], where hundreds of Sikhs [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|were massacred in 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_2440000/2440713.stm |title=Young Sikhs force changes to Hitman 2 |publisher=[[CBBC]] |date=21 November 2002|accessdate=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An altered version of ''Silent Assassin'' was eventually released with the related material removed from the game.

==Religion and violence==
A study released by the University of Missouri stated that video games often emphasize the violent aspects of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5888663/study-says-video-games-have-problematized-view-of-religion|title=Study Says Video Games Have 'Problematized' View of Religion|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Greg Perreault said "It doesn't appear that game developers are trying to purposefully bash organized religion in these games, I believe they are only using religion to create stimulating plot points in their story lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2012/0227-video-games-depict-religion-as-violent-problematized-mu-study-shows/|title=Video Games Depict Religion as Violent, Problematized, MU Study Shows|publisher=MU News Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games as focus of religious studies==
{{main|Game studies}}

For many years video games were seen as mere [[entertainment]], a form of "low culture".&lt;ref&gt;Mäyrä, F. An Introduction to Game Studies (2008). SAGE Publications. Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; Playing video games was seen as a form of [[escapism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 58&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was not regarded as a valid object of scientific research. To "play" games as a scholarly pursuit was thought of as "ludicrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticalreligion.org/2013/10/21/here-be-dragons-the-quest-for-academic-credibility/|title=Here Be Dragons: the quest for academic credibility|work=The Critical Religion Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has only been in recent years that video games have become the object of scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, J. Videogames (2012). Routledge. Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at the game as an object, researchers can explore religious and spiritual references. Video game research is done in two ways; the game can be studied as an [[object (philosophy)|object]], while [[actant|actor-focused]] research looks at the player.

===Game-immanent approach===
Video games, as products of human culture, can be seen and read as "[[Text (literary theory)|texts]]". They carry myths, stories and symbols of the time in which they were created.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Campbell, H. (ed.). Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds (2012). Rutledge. Page 145&lt;/ref&gt; By "reading" video games, philosophers, sociologists and theologians have the opportunity to study the religious and spiritual themes in video games.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, H. A. en Grieve, G. P. Studying Religion in Digital Gaming. A Critical Review of an Emerging Field. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches. Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done in several ways.

*by studying the design, rules and mechanics or by talking to the developers
*by watching others play (e.g. [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play videos]])
*by playing the game themselves&lt;ref&gt;[[Espen Aarseth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Player-focused approach===

Video games are [[Interactivity|interactive]]; it requires input from the player to happen. While a video game developer designs the game, including its rules and story, it is up to the player to make the game "happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Luke |editor-last=Cuddy |title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |date=2008 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; As such, it is up to individual player to give [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] to their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=James |title=Videogames |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games allow the player to think, form and possibly change their own opinion about religious and spiritual matters.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Players often discuss these elements on online platforms. For instance, some players made their own version of the player character [[Commander Shepard]] of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series an atheist, while others thought of him/her{{efn|Commander Shepard can be female or male.}} as a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, T. "Are Those the Only Two Solutions?" In Heidbrink, S., Knoll, T. Wysocki, J. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games Reloaded. Immersion into the Field. Volume 07 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, video games also give new meaning to the concept of religion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14069">'''Religiosity''' is difficult to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and involvement. It includes experiential, ritualistic, ideological, intellectual, consequential, creedal, communal, doctrinal, moral, and cultural dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists of religion have observed that the people's beliefs, sense of belonging, and behavior often are not congruent with an individual's actual religious beliefs since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt; Multiple problems exist in measuring religiosity. For instance, variables such as church attendance produce different results when different methods are used such as traditional surveys vs time use surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rossi |first1=Maurizio |last2=Scappini |first2=Ettore |title=Church Attendance, Problems of Measurement, and Interpreting Indicators: A Study of Religious Practice in the United States, 1975-2010 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=June 2014 |volume=53 |issue=2 |page=249–267 |doi=10.1111/jssr.12115 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12115 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |issn=0021-8294}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Diversity in an individuals' beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors==

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, "Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don’t do it in the dry season."&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic studies often show wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion: 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, 17% are agnostics; also, in terms of self-identification of religiosity 18% consider themselves religious, 37% consider themselves as spiritual but not religious, and 42% considers themselves as neither spiritual nor religious; and 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global studies on religion also show diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Numerous studies have explored the different components of human religiosity (Brink, 1993; Hill &amp; Hood 1999). What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226–244|doi=10.2307/3511418}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cognition
**traditional [[orthodoxy]]
**particularistic orthodoxy
*Effect
**Palpable
**Tangible
*Behavior
**religious behavior
**religious participation

Other researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].

For example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian]] doctrines (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).

An individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.

Most dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.

[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists adapted Glock's list to include additional components (see for example, a  [[Mervin F. Verbit#The Twenty Four-Dimensional Religiosity Measure|six component measure]] by [[Mervin F. Verbit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970).

===Genes and environment===

[[File:Church Attendance and Welfare Spending Graph.png|thumb|350px|National welfare spending vs church attendance in Christian societies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The contributions of [[genes]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] to religiosity have been quantified in [[twin study|studies of twins]] (Bouchard ''et al.'', 1999; Kirk ''et al.'', 1999) and sociological studies of welfare, availability, and legal regulations &lt;ref&gt;Nolan, P., &amp; Lenski, G. E. (2010). Human societies: Introduction to macrosociology. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[state religions]], etc.).

Koenig ''et al.'' (2005) report that the contribution of genes to variation in religiosity (called [[heritability]]) increases from 12% to 44% and the contribution of shared (family) effects decreases from 56% to 18% between [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]].&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Koenig, M. McGue, R. F. Krueger and T. J. Bouchard, Jr. (2005). Genetic and environmental influences on religiousness: findings for retrospective and current religiousness ratings. ''Journal of Personality'', '''73''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00316.x 471-88]&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-based theory of religious choice and governmental regulation of religion have been the dominant theories used to explain variations of religiosity between societies{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}.  However, Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; documented a much stronger correlation between welfare state spending and religiosity.  See "Welfare spending vs Church attendance" diagram on the right.

===Just-world hypothesis===
Studies have found [[Just-world hypothesis|belief in a just world]] to be correlated with aspects of religiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375-382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk-aversion===
Several studies have discovered a positive correlation between the degree of religiousness and [[Risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Risk aversion and religion | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | first = Charles | last = Noussair |author2=Stefan T.

==Definition ==
Individuals experiencing religious delusions are preoccupied with religious subjects that are not within the expected beliefs for an individual's background, including culture, education, and known experiences of religion. These preoccupations are incongruous with the [[mood (psychology)|mood]] of the subject. Falling within the definition also are delusions arising in [[psychotic depression]]; however, these must present within a [[major depressive episode]] and be congruous with mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lieberman | first1=Jeffrey A. | last2=Stroup | first2 = T.

Researchers in a 2000 study found religious delusions to be unrelated to any specific set of diagnostic criteria, but correlated with demographic criteria, primarily age.&lt;ref name="raja2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. |last1=Raja |first2=A. |last2=Azzoni |first3=L. |last3=Lubich |year=2000 |title=Religious delusion: An observational study of religious delusion in a population of 313 acute psychiatric inpatients |journal=Schweizer Archiv für Neurologie und Psychiatrie |volume=151 |issue=1 |pages=22–9 |url=http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322210939/http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF | archivedate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a comparative study sampling 313 patients, those with religious delusion were found to be aged older, and had been placed on a drug regime or started a treatment programme at an earlier stage. In the context of [[Medical sign|presentation]], their [[Global Assessment of Functioning|global functioning]] was found to be worse than another group of patients without religious delusions. The first group also scored higher on the [[Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms]] (SAPS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | publisher=Psychiatric [[University Hospital Zurich]] | last=Andreasen | first = Nancy C. | year=2007 |url=http://www.bli.uzh.ch/PDF/saps.pdf |title=SCALE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF POSITIVE SYMPTOMS | accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a greater total on the [[Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale]] (BPRS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | publisher=[[The University of Iowa]] | work = Iowa Coalition on Mental Health and Aging | url=http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/icmha/outreach/documents/BPRS_expanded.PDF | title=Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) | accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were treated with a higher mean number of [[neuroleptic]] medications of differing types during their hospitalization.&lt;ref name="raja2000"/&gt;

Religious delusion was found in 2007 to strongly correlate with "temporolimbic overactivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10398560601083118 |title=The Interface Between Religion and Psychosis |year=2007 |last1=Ng |first1=Felicity |author10=The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 | pmid = 17464638}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a condition where irregularities in the brain's [[limbic system]] may present as symptoms of [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/513.full.pdf | title = The Temporolimbic System Theory of Paranoid Schizophrenia | first = Manuel F. | last = Casanova | journal = [[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] | volume = 23 | number = 3 | year = 1997 | pages = 513–515 | publisher = Oxford University Press | doi=10.1093/schbul/23.3.513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 study, Swiss psychiatrists found religious delusions with themes of spiritual persecution by malevolent spirit-entities, control exerted over the person by spirit-entities, delusional experience of sin and guilt, or [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/psyc.2010.73.2.158 |title=Delusions with Religious Content in Patients with Psychosis: How They Interact with Spiritual Coping |year=2010 |last1=Mohr |first1=Sylvia |last2=Borras |first2=Laurence |last3=Betrisey |first3=Carine |last4=Pierre-Yves |first4=Brandt |last5=Gilliéron |first5=Christiane |last6=Huguelet |first6=Philippe |journal=Psychiatry: Interpersonal and Biological Processes |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=158–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious delusions have generally been found to be less stressful than [[Delusion#Themes|other types of delusion]].&lt;ref name="raja2000" /&gt; A study found adherents to [[new religious movement]]s to have similar delusionary cognition, as rated by the Delusions Inventory, to a psychotic group, although the former reported feeling less distressed by their experiences than the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1348/014466599162683 |title=Delusional ideation in religious and psychotic populations |year=1999 |last1=Peters |first1=Emmanuelle |last2=Day |first2=Samantha |last3=McKenna |first3=Jacqueline |last4=Orbach |first4=Gilli |journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=38 |pages=83–96 |pmid=10212739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Behaviours out of the ordinary were traditionally viewed as [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0500960.htm | archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050222221921/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0500960.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2005-02-22 | year=2005 | work=Catholic News Service | accessdate=2012-01-23 | title=Real possession by devil not that common, exorcists say during lesson | last=Wooden | first=Cibndy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes, although entirely disavowed by modern psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Peck | first = M. Scott  | title=Glimpses of the Devil: a psychiatrist's personal accounts of possession, exorcism, and redemption | publisher=Simon and Schuster | date=4 Jan 2005 | isbn=0-7432-5467-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; are evaluated by clinicians only such that they fall within the safety of a treatment programme.

Earlier{{when|date=March 2015}} propositions that religious shamans were motivated by delusions and that their behaviour resembled that of patients with [[schizophrenia]] were found to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/ae.1983.10.3.02a00030 |title=Shamanism and schizophrenia: A state-specific approach to the 'schizophrenia metaphor' of shamanic states |year=1983 |last1=Noll |first1=Richard |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=443–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12018978 |year=2002 |last1=Polimeni |first1=J |last2=Reiss |first2=JP |title=How shamanism and group selection may reveal the origins of schizophrenia |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=244–8 |doi=10.1054/mehy.2001.1504 |journal=Medical Hypotheses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1937 essay, [[Sigmund Freud]] stated that he considered believing in a [[single god]] to be a delusion,&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt; thus extending his 1907 comment that religion is the indication of obsessional neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freud.org.uk/education/topic/10573/subtopic/40000/ |title=Religion as obsessional neurosis |publisher=[[Freud Museum]] | last=Freud | first = Sigmund | year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/apt.10.4.287 |title=Working with patients with religious beliefs |year=2004 |last1=Dein |first1=S. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=287–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thoughts defining "delusion" perhaps crystallized from the notion of the religion formulations of the common man (''circa'' 1927) as "patently infantile, foreign to reality";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freud.org.uk/education/topic/10573/subtopic/40005/ |title=Religion as a mass delusion |publisher=Freud Museum |last=Freud | first = Sigmund | year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the same year he also stated that religion "comprises a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality, such as we find in an isolated form nowhere else but amentia, in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Future of an Illusion|last=Freud | first = Sigmund | year=1927 | isbn=978-0-393-00831-9 | oclc= 20479722}} cited in: {{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0101-60832007000700013 |title=Religion, spirituality and psychotic disorders |year=2007 |last1=Koenig |first1=Harold G. |journal=Revista de Psiquiatria Clínica |volume=34 |pages=95–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Examples from a 295-subject study in [[Lithuania]] showed that the most common religious delusions were being a saint (in women) and being God (in men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18695349 |year=2008 |last1=Rudaleviciene |first1=P |last2=Stompe |first2=T |last3=Narbekovas |first3=A |last4=Raskauskiene |first4=N |last5=Bunevicius |first5=R |title=Are religious delusions related to religiosity in schizophrenia? |volume=44 |issue=7 |pages=529–35 |journal=Medicina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study of 193 people who had previously been admitted to hospital and subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia, 24% were found to have religious delusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s001270200005 |title=Religious delusions in patients admitted to hospital with schizophrenia |year=2002 |last1=Siddle |first1=Ronald |last2=Haddock |first2=Gillian |last3=Tarrier |first3=Nicholas |last4=Faragher |first4=E.Brian |journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=130–8 |pmid=11990010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 study identified that religious delusions were often present or expressed in persons with [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic]] committal to a psychiatric unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0087835 |title=Understanding the religious ideation of forensically committed patients |year=1999 |last1=Kunst |first1=Jennifer L. |journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=287–297 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pst/36/3/287/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical examples==

===Biblical===
{{see also|Neuroscience of religion|Psychology of religion|Mental health of Jesus}}
Although many researchers have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious practices and experiences may be linked to [[mental illness]]es of various kind ([[mood disorders]], [[personality disorders]], [[psychiatric disorders]]). In 2011, a team of [[psychiatrists]], [[Behaviorism|behavioral psychologists]], [[neurologists]] and [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrists]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]] published a research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to religious delusion and [[hyperreligiosity]].&lt;ref name="JNCN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=Journal of Neuropsichiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=September 2011 |pages=410–426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |cid= |url=https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214  |access-date=March 22, 2018 |issn=1545-7222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They compared the thought and behavior of the most important figures in the [[Bible]] ([[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]])&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; with patients affected by mental disorders related to the [[Spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychotic spectrum]] using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria ([[DSM-IV-TR]]),&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and concluded that these Biblical figures "may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations",&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; such as [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], [[delusional disorder]], [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]]-[[visual hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], [[Geschwind syndrome]] (Paul especially) and abnormal experiences associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

In 1998–2000 [[Poles|Pole]] Leszek Nowak (born 1962)&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Polish philosopher and lawyer [[Leszek Nowak]] (1943–2009) also from Poznań.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Poznań]] authored a study in which, based on his own history of religious delusions of mission and overvalued ideas, and information communicated in the Gospels, made an attempt at reconstructing Jesus′ psyche&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Nowak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160514125307/http://www.opracowanie.eu/index_2.htm Prywatna Witryna Internetowa Leszka Nowaka] at [[Internet Archive]] (Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; with the view of [[Portraits of the historical Jesus#Apocalyptic prophet|Jesus as apocalyptic prophet]].&lt;ref name=Nowak&gt;Analysis of fragments of the New Testament books for Jesus as apocalyptic prophet: Leszek Nowak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160523101437/http://www.opracowanie.eu/pomylka_2.htm ″A great mistake and disappointment of early Christianity″] at [[Internet Archive]] (Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; He does so in chapters containing, in sequence, an analysis of character traits of the ″savior of mankind″, a description of the possible course of events from the period of Jesus' public activity, a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] explanation of miracles.

===Historical===
A religious experience of communication from heavenly or divine beings could be interpreted as a test of faith. An example of such is [[Joan of Arc]], ''La Pucelle d'Orléans'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A1NrfO2uFNAC | title = A Still, Small Voice: A Practical Guide on Reporting Revelations | first = Father Benedict J. | last = Groeschel | publisher = Ignatius Press | year = 1993 | pages = 52–53| isbn = 9780898704365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who rallied French forces late in the [[Hundred Years' War]].

[[Daniel Paul Schreber]] is an example of a supposed religious delusion occurring in a developed condition of psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Corveleyn | first=Jozef | chapter=Religious Delusion in Psychosis and Hysteria | title=Changing the Scientific Study of Religion: Beyond Freud? | editor-first=J. A. |editor-last=Belzen | year=2009 | publisher=Springer | isbn=9789048125401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schreber was a successful and highly respected German judge until middle age, when he came to believe that God was turning him into a woman. Two of his three illnesses (1884–1885 and 1893–1902) are described in his book ''Memoirs of My Nervous Illness'' (original German title ''Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schreber | first =Daniel Paul | title =Memoirs of My Nervous Illness | publisher =New York Review of Books, 2000 | year = 1903 | location =New York | isbn = 0-940322-20-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became an influential book in the history of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychoanalysis]] thanks to its interpretation by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref #Freud&gt;{{cite book | last =Freud | first =Sigmund | authorlink =Sigmund Freud | last2 =Webber | first2 =Andrew (translator) | last3 =MacCabe | first3 =Colin (contributor) | authorlink3 =Colin MacCabe | title =The Schreber Case | publisher =Penguin Classics Psychology, 2003 | year = 1911 | location =New York | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iY1917GJxqEC&amp;pg=PR22&amp;lpg=PR22&amp;dq=isbn=0142437425#PPP1,M1 | isbn = 0-14-243742-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harvard Medical School research also focused on [[Social psychology|social models]] of [[psychopathology]],&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; analyzing [[new religious movements]] and charismatic [[Cult|cult leaders]] such as [[David Koresh]], leader of the [[Branch Davidians]],&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and [[Marshall Applewhite]], founder of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]].&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; The researchers concluded that "If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum."&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

===Auditory hallucination and crime===
An individual may hear communication from heavenly or divine beings compelling one to [[religious violence|commit acts of violence]]. Some cite the case of the Hebrew patriarch [[Abraham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Katz | first=Claire Elise | title=The Voice of God and the Face of the Other: Levinas, Kierkegaard, and Abraham | journal=The Journal of Textual Reasoning | date=2001 | url=http://jtr.lib.virginia.edu/archive/volume10/Katz.html | volume=10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225214716/http://jtr.lib.virginia.edu/archive/volume10/Katz.html | archivedate=2013-12-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was commanded by God to [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice his son Isaac]]. However, when Abraham was prepared to act on it, God informed him that this was only a test of faith and forbade any human sacrifice.

In contemporary times persons judged to have experienced [[auditory hallucination]] include those hearing voices instructing or motivating them to commit violent acts. These auditory experiences are classified by psychiatry as [[command hallucination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18477881 |year=2008 |last1=Shawyer |first1=F |last2=MacKinnon |first2=A |last3=Farhall |first3=J |last4=Sims |first4=E |last5=Blaney |first5=S |last6=Yardley |first6=P |last7=Daly |first7=M |last8=Mullen |first8=P |last9=Copolov |first9=D |title=Acting on harmful command hallucinations in psychotic disorders: An integrative approach |volume=196 |issue=5 |pages=390–8 |doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318171093b |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease }}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons acting to commit [[murder]] are reported as hearing voices of religious beings such as [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Gaines | first = James | authorlink = James R.

[[File:Bahubali Shravana Belagola.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|The Lord [[Bahubali]] statue symbolising absolute renunciation from the [[Samsara]].]]
'''Renunciation''' (or '''renouncing''') is the act of rejecting something, especially if it is something that the renouncer has previously enjoyed or endorsed.

In religion, renunciation often indicates an abandonment of pursuit of material comforts, in the interests of achieving [[spiritual enlightenment]]. It is highly practiced in Jainism. In [[Hinduism]], the renounced order of life is ''[[sannyasa|sannyāsa]]''; in Buddhism, the Pali word for "renunciation" is ''[[nekkhamma]]'', conveying more specifically "giving up the world and leading a holy life" or "freedom from lust, craving and desires".&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 377, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:692.pali entry for "Nekkhamma"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707141638/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:692.pali |date=7 July 2012 }} (retrieved 2008-04-12).  Rhys Davids &amp; Stede speculate that the [[Sanskrit]] term with which ''nekkhamma'' is associated is either:
:* ''nai{{IAST|ṣ}}kramya'' &amp;mdash; "inactivity, abstinence or exemption from acts and their consequences" ([http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0570-naipAtya.jpg Monier Williams, 1964, p. 570, entry for "Naish"])
:* ''nai{{IAST|ṣ}}kāmya'' &amp;mdash; "suppression of desire, profound contemplation" ([http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0570-naipAtya.jpg ''ibid''.]).&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Sangha]], [[Bhikkhu]], [[Bhikkhuni]], [[Śramaṇa]]. In [[Christianity]], some denominations have a tradition of renunciation of [[the Devil]].

Legally, renunciation arises in [[nationality law]] with the [[renunciation of citizenship]], a formal process by which the renouncer ceases to hold [[citizenship]] with a specific country. A person can also renounce property, as when a person submits a [[disclaimer of interest]] in property that has been left to them in a [[will (law)|will]].

==Mahatma Gandhi==

It is widely believed in India that voluntary renunciation is how one gains power, for whatever purpose. In South Africa (1893-1915) [[Gandhi]] tried many spiritual practices and experiments, almost all of them including a component of renunciation, based in the practice of [[Sannyasi]]. After reading “Unto this Last” By John Ruskin in 1904 he redoubled his commitment to gain greater control over self, increasing his capacity to work for the common welfare and find a greater sense of oneness with others. The ultimate renunciation is of self, one's separateness from others and the world.

==Christianity==
In some [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]], renunciation of the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] is a common [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[rubric]]. This is most often seen in connection with the sacrament of [[baptism]]. In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church a baptism usually contains the "Prayer of Exorcism". Later in the ceremony, the parents and [[Godparent|godparents]] are asked to publicly renounce the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/textcontents/index/4/subindex/67/textindex/7|title=The Catholic Liturgical Library|website=www.catholicliturgy.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]] dismissed this rubric in a 2014 renewal of liturgy. According to [[The Independent]], this was done in an attempt to "widen the appeal" of the rite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/devil-vows-taken-out-of-christening-services-as-church-of-england-aims-to-widen-appeal-9604399.html|title=Devil vows taken out of Christening services as Church of England aims|date=2014-07-14|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prior report for the Church's Liturgical Commission stated that "[f]or the majority of those attending, the existing provision can seem complex and inaccessible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-2690262/BAPTISM-SERVICES-MAY-OMIT-DEVIL.html|title=BAPTISM SERVICES MAY OMIT 'DEVIL'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Church of Norway]], the public renunciation of the Devil is a obligatory element in the [[Church service|Main Service]]. It is stated by the congregation before the profession of faith (usually the [[Apostles' Creed]], as the [[Nicene Creed]] is largely reserved for special observances). When performed in a service which includes a baptism, it is also considered an extension of the testimony given by the [[Godparent|sponsors]], as they are required to confess to a denomination which does not rejects the Apostles' or the Nicene Creed, nor rejects [[infant baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://kirken.no/globalassets/kirken.no/om-troen/liturgier-oversatt/the-order-of-the-principal-service.pdf "''The Order of the Principal Service''", as derived from "''The Service Book for the Church of Norway''".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2791">'''Sacred contagion''' is the belief that spiritual properties within an object, place, or person may be passed to another object, place, or person, usually by direct contact or physical proximity. While the concept of sacred contagion has existed in numerous cultures since before recorded history, the term "sacred contagion" originated with French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], who introduced it in his book, ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life''. For example, the [[Book of Leviticus]], in Chapters 11 through 15, specifies which animals are considered spiritually clean and unclean, and defines women during [[menstruation]] and men after a [[nocturnal emission]] as unclean.

The text also gives many examples of sacred contagion brought about by contact with these spiritually unclean people and things. For example, chapter 15 states that spiritual uncleanliness exists not only in the menstruating woman but also the bed she sleeps in, as well as any object placed upon that bed, and any person who touches an object placed upon that bed. We see not only the passing of uncleanliness through spiritual contagion, but also that the uncleanliness may be further passed, from person to object and back to person indefinitely.

Anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]], whose work is heavily influenced by Durkheim, wrote an extensive modern work on the topic of sacred contagion entitled ''[[Purity and danger|Purity and Danger: An Analysis of the Concepts of Pollution and Taboo]]''.  She states that, "We cannot understand sacred contagion unless we distinguish a class of cultures in which pollution ideas flourish from another class of cultures, including our own, in which they do not." Douglas and Durkheim both rejected the idea that concepts of purity and impurity, such as those found in Leviticus, were an attempt to use religion to explain hygiene, an otherwise impossible task in the scientific terms of the time, several millennium before the concept of [[Microorganism|germs]].  Instead, according to Douglas and Durkheim, spiritual cleanliness and physical cleanliness are wholly separate and must be considered on their own terms.

==Background==
Pakistan, which has a mostly [[Sunni]] population, has seen sectarian attacks against minorities including Shias, who account for about 35–40% of Pakistan's population, and are the followers of the Prophet's progeny.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt; Two days prior to these attacks dozens of Shias were killed in a similar [[September 2010 Lahore bombings|attack]] in [[Lahore]]. Sunni militant groups like [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]] which operate freely in Pakistan have for years targeted minorities including Shias.

On the day prior to this attack Pakistan's interior minister [[Rehman Malik]] had asked the Shia community not to hold large gatherings due to security concerns.&lt;ref name="lat20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-blast-20100904,0,6390463.story|title=Pakistan suicide bombing kills 58|last=Rodriguez|first=Alex|date=3 September 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
The procession was to mark the Quds Day event staged every year by the Shia community to oppose Israel's occupation of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="dawn20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/03-blast-near-meezan-chowk-in-quetta-ss-09|title=Suicide bomber kills 53 at Shia rally in Quetta|date=3 September 2010|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally drew an estimated 2,500 participants, mostly Shiias. The size of the blast caused a stampede.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt; The explosion occurred in the Meezan chowk area of the town. The bomb exploded around 3:05&amp;nbsp;pm local time. It was estimated that the suicide bomber used about 15 kilograms of explosives.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"/&gt;

===Responsibility===
[[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] claimed responsibility for the attack and said a 22-year-old suicide bomber, Rashid Moaawia, carried out the attack.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-09/03/c_13477509.htm|title=L-e-J group claims responsibility for suicide blast in Pakistan's Quetta|date=3 September 2010|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the blast, widespread protests erupted in the city with gunfire being heard across the city. Several shops were burnt by the protesters.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"/&gt; People were seen lying on the roads to avoid gunfire, while others set fire to vehicles and buildings to vent their anger.&lt;ref name="dawn20100903"/&gt;

After the blast, police cordoned off the area and fired in the air to hold back people trying to search for their relatives.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt;

Thousands have attended a funeral in the Pakistani city of Quetta for victims of a suicide attack on a Shia Muslim procession.

The death toll from Friday's attack rose from 43 to 65 overnight as critically wounded people died in hospitals, police said on Saturday.

Shops and schools remained closed the following day. Security was also stepped up at mosques across Pakistan.

Thousands attended a funeral mass in Quetta.&lt;ref name="aje20100904x"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/09/2010948413333315.html|title=Pakistan mourns blast victims|date=4 September 2010|publisher=Al Jazeerah English|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] condemned the attack and ordered an investigation. Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] told the press that militants want to encourage sectarianism in an effort to destabilise the government following a series of military offensives against them. He also claimed that Punjabi, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and al-Qaida and the Tehrik-e-Taliban are one and the same.&lt;ref name="voa20100904"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Pakistani-Flooding-to-Affect-Fight-Against-Militants-102218169.html|title=Pakistani Flooding Impacts Fight Against Militants|date=4 September 2010|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shiite Conference, Balochistan'' announced a 40-day mourning period in line with Shia custom.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt;

UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]]'s spokesman said "These attacks, which deliberately targeted Shiite Muslims and killed or injured scores of civilians, are unacceptable."&lt;ref name="UN20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35821&amp;Cr=pakistan&amp;Cr1=|title=UN chief deplores deadly attacks against Pakistan’s Shiite Muslims|date=3 September 2010|publisher=UN News Centre|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condemning the attacks the [[White House]] stated "To target innocent civilians during the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]] at an already difficult time as the country is working hard to recover from [[2010 Pakistan floods|terrible flooding]] caused by monsoons makes these acts even more reprehensible."&lt;ref name="afp20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hWrPLE_lAq_hxdByLfIiuCYPQemw|title=US condemns 'reprehensible' Pakistan bombings|date=3 September 2010|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15041">'''Spiritual direction''' is the practice of being with people as they attempt to deepen their relationship with the [[divinity|divine]], or to learn and grow in their own personal [[spirituality]].  The person seeking direction shares stories of his or her encounters of the divine, or how he or she is cultivating a life attuned to spiritual things.  The director listens and asks questions to assist the directee in his or her process of [[Introspection|reflection]] and spiritual growth. Spiritual direction advocates claim that it develops a deeper awareness with the spiritual aspect of being human, and that it is not [[psychotherapy]], counseling, or financial planning.

== Forms ==
While there is some degree of variability, there are primarily two forms of spiritual direction: regular direction and [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] direction. They differ largely in the frequency of meeting and in the intensity of reflection.

Regular direction can involve a one- to two-hour meeting every four to eight weeks, and thus is slightly less intense than retreat direction, although spiritual exercises and disciplines are often given for the directee to attempt between meetings.

If the directee is on a retreat (lasting a weekend, a week or even 40 days), he or she will generally meet with his or her director on a daily basis for one hour. During these daily meetings, exercises or spiritual disciplines such as [[lectio divina]] are given to the directee as fodder to continue his or her spiritual growth. Alternatively, retreat centres often offer direction or companionship to persons visiting the centre alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivendellretreat.org/personal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510043839/http://www.rivendellretreat.org/personal.html |archivedate=2012-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola]] are a popular example of guidelines used for spiritual direction.

== Historical traditions ==

=== Western Christianity ===
Within [[Christianity]], spiritual direction has its roots in [[early Church|Early Christianity]].  The [[gospel]]s describe [[Jesus]] serving as a mentor to his disciples. Additionally, [[The Book of Acts|Acts of the Apostles]] Chapter 9 describes Ananias helping [[Paul of Tarsus]] to grow in his newfound experience of Christianity.  Likewise, several of the [[Pauline epistles]] describe Paul mentoring both Timothy and Titus among others.  Tradition tells us that [[John the Evangelist]] tutored [[Polycarp]], the 2nd-century bishop of [[Smyrna]].

Theologian [[John Cassian]] who lived in the 4th century provided some of the earliest recorded guidelines on the Christian practice of spiritual direction.&lt;ref name=christ&gt;{{cite web | title = Got Your 'Spiritual Director' Yet? |publisher= [[Christianity Today]] | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/aprilweb-only/4-28-51.0.html?paging=off 
|date=April 1, 2003| accessdate = 2014-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced mentoring in the monasteries. Each novice was put under the care of an older monk. [[Benedict of Nursia]] integrated Cassian's guidelines into what is now known as the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]].

Spiritual direction is widespread in the Catholic religion: a person with wisdom and spiritual discernment, usually but not exclusively a priest or consecrated in general, provides counsel to a person who wishes to make a journey of faith and discovery of God's will in his life. The spiritual guide aims to discern, understand what the Holy Spirit, through the situations of life, spiritual insights fruit of prayer, reading and meditation on the Bible, tells the person accompanied. The spiritual father or spiritual director may provide advice, give indications of life and prayer, resolving doubts in matters of faith and morals without replacing the choices and decisions to the person accompanying.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
Eastern Orthodoxy comes from the same pre-schism traditions, but the role of a "spiritual director" or "elder" in Orthodoxy has maintained its important role.  The original Greek term geron (meaning "elder", as in gerontology) was rendered by the Russian word [[starets]], from Old Church Slavonic starĭtsĭ, "elder", derived from starŭ, "old". The Greek tradition has a long unbroken history of elders and disciples, such as [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] and [[John Moschos]] in the seventh century, [[Symeon the Studite|Symeon the Elder]] and [[Symeon the New Theologian]] in the eleventh century, and contemporary charismatic gerontes such as [[Porphyrios (Bairaktaris) of Kafsokalivia|Porphyrios]] and [[Paisios (Eznepidis)|Paisios]]. [[Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[Nil Sorsky]] were two most venerated startsy of Old [[Muscovy]]. The revival of elders in the Slavic world is associated with the name of [[Paisius Velichkovsky]] (1722–94), who produced the Russian translation of the [[Philokalia]]. The most famous Russian starets of the early 19th century was [[Seraphim of Sarov]] (1759-1833), who went on to become one of the most revered Orthodox saints.
The [[Optina Pustyn]] near [[Kozelsk]] used to be celebrated for its startsy (Schema-Archimandrite Moses, Schema-Hegumen Anthony, Hieroschemamonk Leonid, Hieroschemamonk Macarius, Hieroschemamonk Hilarion, Hieroschemamonk Ambrose, Hieroschemamonk Anatole (Zertsalov)).[1] Such writers as [[Nikolay Gogol]], [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Konstantin Leontyev]] sought advice from the elders of this monastery. They also inspired the figure of Zosima in Dostoyevsky's novel [[The Brothers Karamazov]]. A more modern example of a starets is Archimandrite [[John Krestiankin]] (1910-2006) of the [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]] who was popularly recognized as such by many [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] living in [[Russia]].

=== Judaism ===
In [[Judaism]], the Hebrew term for spiritual director differs among traditional communities. The verb ''Hashpa'ah'' is common in some communities though not all; the spiritual director called a ''mashpi'a'' occurs in the [[Habad]]-Lubavitch community and also in the [[Jewish Renewal]] community. A  ''mashgiakh ruchani'' is the equivalent role among [[mitnagedim]] (adherents of the ''[[Musar movement|mussar]]'' tradition). The purpose of hashpa'ah is to support the directee in her or his personal relationship with God, and to deepen that person's ability to find God's presence in ordinary life. Amongst [[Lubavitchers]] this draws on the literature and praxis of [[Hasidism]] as it is practiced according to Habad standards, and to Jewish mystical tradition generally. Spiritual mentorship is customary in the Hasidic world, but not necessarily in the same way.

=== Sufism ===
In [[Sufism]], the term used for spiritual master is ''[[murshid]]'', Arabic for "guide" or "teacher". He is more than a spiritual director and believed to be guiding the disciples based on his direct connectivity with the Divine. The murshid's role is to spiritually guide and verbally instruct the disciple on the Sufi path after the disciple takes an oath of allegiance or [[Bay'ah]] (''bai'ath'') with him. The concept of Murshid Kamil Akmal (also known as Insan-e-Kamil) is significant in most [[tariqa]]s. The doctrine states that from pre-existence till pre-eternity, there shall always remain a [[Qutb]] or a Universal Man upon the earth who would be the perfect manifestation of God and at the footsteps of the Islamic prophet [[Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="Murshid Kamil Akmal (Perfect Spiritual Guide)"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman|title=Perfect Spiritual Guide (Murshid-e-Kamil Akmal) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVxlAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=murshid+kamil+akmal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=murshid%20kamil%20akmal&amp;f=false|publisher=Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand French|Commission_Stasi|date=January 2012}}
The French '''commission Stasi''' is a commission set up to reflect upon the application of the ''[[laïcité]]'' principle. Named after the chair [[Bernard Stasi]], [[ombudsman]] of the (French) Republic (''médiateur de la République'') since 1998, and consisting of 20 members, it was set up by the [[President of France|president of the Republic]] [[Jacques Chirac]] on 3 July 2003. It reported its conclusions on 11 December 2003.

==Overview==

Jacques Chirac established the commission to reflect upon the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' and its application in France. He appointed Bernard Stasi to oversee the commission.&lt;ref&gt;France 5, ''Dossiers - Débat Public :'' [http://www.france5.fr/actu_societe/W00137/9/102197.cfm La laïcité (La Commission Stasi)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the commission interviewed various representatives from different groups, for example religious leaders such as [[Cardinal Lustiger]], intellectuals such as [[Régis Debray]] and [[Patrick Weil]] as well school headteachers, political leaders, equal-rights groups and social groups (for example the [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rapports/r1275-t2.asp&lt;/ref&gt;



The commission emerged from public debates concerning the place of the [[hijab]] in French public life in relation to the principles of laïcité, in particular whether its was appropriate in state schools. In addition the commission sought to more clearly define the application of laïcité in the workplace, public services and public spaces. To this end the Stasi Commission lead to the introduction of the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]]. Despite this apparent resolution to the questions concerning laïcité, the controversy surrounding the wearing of the hijab and the media attention paid to it has meant that it remains a source of disagreement within the political class.

In response to the commission's report Jacques Chirac called for the French public to unite around the principle of laïcité.

==Principles==

The report espouses two key stances that emerge from the history of secularism in France: state neutrality in regard to religion and [[freedom of thought]] particularly in relation to freedom of worship. The report also acknowledges that tensions arise between these two principles particularly in the spheres of the army, prisons, hospitals and education.

The Commission also called for the incorporation of 'accomodements raisonables' or [[reasonable accommodation]] into the principles of laïcité for problems that are not covered by the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5215">'''The Ritual of Embalming Papyrus''' or ''Papyrus of the Embalming Ritual'' is one of only two extant papyri which detail anything at all about the practices of [[mummification]] used within the burial practices of Ancient Egyptian culture.

One version of the papyri is contained within the [[Egyptian museum]] Cairo (''Pap. Boulaq No.3'') and the other is within the [[Louvre]] (No. 5158).&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;Robert (''Bob'') Brier, Ronald S.

==The papyri==
The papyri within Cairo was located and discovered during the year 1857, within a tomb in Thebes.  The papyri represents the last ten pages of a work of which all other pages are lost, of these, eight were in a good condition.&lt;ref name="Wade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G.E.Smith &amp; W.R.Dawson"/&gt;

The Louvre papyri shows the same information as is held on the last two pages of the Cairo.&lt;ref name="G.E.Smith &amp; W.R.Dawson"/&gt;

Both are copies made in [[hieratic script]], with [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] notation,  during the Roman period, and were copied from a single earlier text.&lt;ref name="G.E.Smith &amp; W.R.Dawson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OdtgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=The+Ritual+of+Embalming+Papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nh-TVd6yKsv8Ut30gaAD&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ritual%20of%20Embalming%20Papyrus&amp;f=false|author-link=Christina Riggs|author=Christina Riggs|title=Unwrapping Ancient Egypt: The Shroud, the Secret and the Sacred (p.81)|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing 5 Jun 2014, 336 pages| ISBN =0857855077|accessdate=2015-07-01}}(ed. this source used to add &lt; some Demotic notations, Papyrus of the Embalming Ritual, eleven acts, wrapping,  &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The papyri probably dates to the 1st century A.D., and contain specifically information on eleven acts of anointing of the body, the wrapping and placing of internal organs, which had been treated, inside [[Canopic jars]], and the act of performing the bandaging of the embalmed corpse to create a mummy.&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Riggs, Christina"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10x347#page-3|author-link=Christina Riggs|author=Riggs, Christina|title=Funerary rituals (Ptolemaic and Roman Periods) In Jacco Dieleman, Willeke Wendrich (eds.), UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Los Angeles.|publisher=[[UCLA]] Encyclopedia of Egyptology|accessdate=2015-06-29}}([https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10x34 permalink]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Andrews - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RxOKmuZUeM4C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=The+Ritual+of+Embalming+Papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4hiTVavIE8buUPWYgagK&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ritual%20of%20Embalming%20Papyrus&amp;f=false Egyptian Mummies] Harvard University Press 2004 (reprint, revised), 96 pages, {{ISBN|0674013913}} [Retrieved 2015-06-30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ritual==
The act of mummification described was to be done while religious acts of [[Prayer|praying]] and [[Incantations|incantation]] were performed [[ritual]]istically.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sXiMtMnPHikC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=The+Ritual+of+Embalming+Papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OhuTVfLnLsPbU8aTofgM&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ritual%20of%20Embalming%20Papyrus&amp;f=false Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary (p.267)] ''Études préliminaires aux religions orientales dans l'Empire romain'', BRILL, 1973, 301 pages, {{ISBN|9004035141}} [Retrieved 2015-06-30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons necessarily present and participating within a performance of the ritual were a ''master of secrets'' or ''[[stolist]]'' (both refer to the same person), a ''[[lector]]'', and a divine chancellor or seal-bearer (''hetemu-netjer''). Of the persons present, the individual who was the   ''hery-sheshta'' fulfilled the most important and superior position, the ''hetemu-netjer'' was next in importance,  then the  ''wetiu'', who were to wrap the embalmed corpse in material.&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Riggs, Christina"/&gt;

The text proceeds in the direction of the embalming the head, toward the feet.&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"/&gt;

The head was to be wrapped firstly in linen, of this first linen, the embalmer was to obtain the linen from [[Sais]], with a second layer added afterwards.&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16572">A '''tobacco fatwa''' is a [[fatwa]] ([[Islam]]ic legal pronouncement) that prohibits the usage of [[tobacco]] by [[Muslim]]s. All contemporary rulings condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit ([[haraam|haram]]) smoking outright as a result of the [[Health effects of tobacco|severe health damage]] that it causes. [[Arab Muslims]] tend to prohibit smoking (despite [[Saudi Arabia]] ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanbedu.com/2009/10/09/saudi-arabia-don%E2%80%99t-keep-us-from-smoking/|title=Saudi Arabia:  Don’t Keep Us From Smoking|work=American Bedu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged:&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghouri|first1=N|last2=Atcha|first2=M|last3=Sheikh|first3=A|title=Influence of Islam on smoking among Muslims.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=4 February 2006|volume=332|issue=7536|pages=291-4|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7536.291|pmid=16455732|pmc=1360407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many Muslims, the legal status of smoking has changed during recent years, and numerous fatawas, including from notable authorities such as [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, now consider smoking ''[[haram]]'' (prohibited). The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include [[Islamic law]]'s general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Quran says, "And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, jurists rely on the exhortations in the Quran not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with [[secondhand smoke]] has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, distress, or harm to other people.&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"/&gt;

Fatwas condemning smoking have been issued in [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[UAE]], among others.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Byron /&gt;  

==History==
The earliest fatwa regarding smoking was issued in Morocco in 1602. Following the introduction of tobacco to the kingdom in 1598, King [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] sought guidance from religious scholars in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. The kingdom's Grand Mufti and the Wali of Sila both ruled that smoking was forbidden in Islam. This ruling failed to have much effect on tobacco use in the kingdom, leading the Mufti to issue a second ruling forbidding its use, as the use of all "intoxicants and harmful substances" is forbidden in Islam. This categorical prohibition was unsuccessful, and the Mufti and the other scholars who joined him in his ruling were either killed by a mob angry at this ruling or fled the country.{{r|WHO|pp=13-15}}

In recent years, [[tobacco fatwa]]s (Islamic legal pronouncements) have been issued due to health concerns.

The holy book of [[Islam]], the [[Qur'ān]], does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance:

* “Don't throw yourself into danger by your own hands...” (el-Bakara 2/195)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “You may eat, drink, but not waste” (el-A‘râf 7/31)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|7|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Do not kill yourselves for God Almighty is most merciful to you" (en-Nisaa' 4/29)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|4|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, [[Pakistan]]) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hameed|first1=A|last2=Jalil|first2=MA|last3=Noreen|first3=R|last4=Mughal|first4=I|last5=Rauf|first5=S|title=Role of Islam in prevention of smoking.|journal=Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad|date=2002|volume=14|issue=1|pages=23-5|pmid=12043328|url=http://www.ayubmed.edu.pk/JAMC/PAST/14-1/Hameed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young Muslim Arab-Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=SM|last2=Johnson|first2=CA|title=Correlates of smoking behavior among Muslim Arab-American adolescents.|journal=Ethnicity &amp; Health|date=November 2003|volume=8|issue=4|pages=319-37|doi=10.1080/13557850310001631722|pmid=14660124|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714038251~db=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking [[fatwa]] did not reduce smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radwan |first1=GN |last2=Israel |first2=E |last3=El-Setouhy |first3=M |last4=Abdel-Aziz |first4=F |last5=Mikhail |first5=N |last6=Mohamed |first6=MK |title=Impact of religious rulings (Fatwa) on smoking. |journal=Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology |date=December 2003 |volume=33 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1087-101 |pmid=15119472 |url=http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012204303/http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |archivedate=2004-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

The prominent scholar [[Yusuf al Qaradawi]] argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification of the cause on which the ruling is based. They all agree that whatever is proved to be harmful to the body and mind is prohibited, yet they differ whether this ruling applies to smoking. Some of them claimed that smoking has some benefits, others assured that it had few disadvantages compared to its benefits, whereas a third group maintained that it had neither benefits nor bad effects. This means that if scholars had been certain about the harmfulness of smoking, then they would undoubtedly have considered it prohibited.[…]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Second: Our inclination to consider smoking prohibited does not mean that it is as grave as major sins like adultery, drinking alcohol or theft. In fact, prohibited matters in Islam are relative; some of them are minor prohibitions whereas others are major, and each has its own ruling. The major sins, for example, have no expiation other than sincere repentance. However, the minor sins can be expiated by the Five Prayers, the [[Friday Prayer]], the Fasting of [[Ramadan]], the Night Vigil Prayer in Ramadan, and other acts of worship. They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192447/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |title=Is the Ruling on Smoking Still Controversial? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |archivedate=13 February 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fatwas ruling that smoking is impermissible have been issued by sheikhs of all four Sunni schools of [[fiqh]]—[[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]]—as well as by those of the [[Ibadi]] sect.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

==Egypt==
In 2000, the [[Grand Mufti of Egypt]], Dr. [[Nasr Farid Wasil]], ruled that smoking was ''[[haram]]''  (forbidden) in Islam because of its detrimental health effects.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Khayat |editor1-first=M.H. |title=Islamic Ruling on Smoking |date=2000 |publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean |location=Alexandria, Egypt |isbn=92-9021-277-2 |edition=2 |url=http://applications.emro.who.int/dsaf/dsa46.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa, which ruled that smoking is a major sin on par with alcohol use and acceptable grounds for divorce, triggered substantial controversy in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Hossam&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Hossam |title=RELIGION-EGYPT: Fatwa On Smoking Triggers Debate |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2000/10/religion-egypt-fatwa-on-smoking-triggers-debate/ |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=IPS |date=October 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Imam Gadul Haq Ali Gadul Haq, the Sheikh of [[al-Azhar mosque]], the center of Islamic learning in the Sunni world, issued a similar ruling in 2000, citing the following verse from the Quran as justification: "and cast not yourselves to ruin with your own hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|WHO|pg=22}} 

==Indonesia==
In 2009, [[Majelis Ulama Indonesia]], the organization of Indonesian religious scholars, declared smoking in public or near pregnant women ''haram'' (forbidden), while declaring smoking in general to be ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged or reprehensible).&lt;ref name=Byron&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008111| issn = 2044-6055| volume = 5| issue = 12| pages = –008111| last1 = Byron| first1 = M.

==Iran==
Iran’s Grand Ayatollah [[Mirza Shirazi]] in 1891 [[Tobacco Protest|issued a fatwa against tobacco]].

==Malaysia==
Malaysia's [[National Fatwa Council]] first issued a fatwa against smoking in 1996, when it declared smoking haram because of its detrimental health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Don’t take ‘smoking is haram’ fatwa lightly, Muslims told |url=https://www.malaymail.com/s/487343/dont-take-smoking-is-haram-fatwa-lightly-muslims-told |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=malaymail |date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a study of Muslims and Buddhists in Malaysia found that this fatwa and other religious norms against smoking have had an independent and significant increase in quit attempts. Among Muslims, religious pressure against smoking was more effective at inspiring people to quit than social pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s12529-012-9225-6| issn = 1070-5503| volume = 20| issue = 2| pages = 252–258| last1 = Yong| first1 = Hua-Hie| last2 = Savvas| first2 = Steven| last3 = Borland| first3 = Ron| last4 = Thrasher| first4 = James| last5 = Sirirassamee| first5 = Buppha| last6 = Omar| first6 = Maizurah| title = Secular Versus Religious Norms Against Smoking: Which Is More Important as a Driver of Quitting Behaviour Among Muslim Malaysian and Buddhist Thai Smokers?| journal = International Journal of Behavioral Medicine| accessdate = 2018-08-02| date = 2013-06-01| url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-012-9225-6| pmc = 3412917}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the National Fatwa Council followed-up by issuing a fatwa declaring [[electronic cigarette]]s haram because of their harmful health effects and bad smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia's Fatwa Council declares electronic cigarettes as 'haram' or forbidden |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-fatwa-council-declares-electronic-cigarettes-as-haram-or-forbidden |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=The Straits Times |date=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Oman==
In 1996, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Hamad Al Khalili, the Grand Mufti of Oman, issued a fatwa prohibiting smoking and the sale of tobacco, comparing smoking to "sipping poison" Sheikh Al Khalili cited a verse from the Quran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|4|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "do not kill yourselves for God Almighty is most merciful to you," to justify his ruling.{{r|WHO|pg=91}}

The [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia]], Sheikh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal Al-Sheikh, has ruled that "smoking is impermissible on the basis of authentic quotations, sound judgments, and the opinions of reputable physicians."{{r|WHO|pg=97}} The Mufti cites a sahih [[hadith]] (verifiable saying of the Prophet) saying "do not harm yourself or others." He further referenced a Quranic verse saying that the Prophet "forbids that which is unwholesome." 

==The UAE==
In addition to issuing a fatwa against smoking, the United Arab Emirates instructed imams in all mosques to read a sermon against smoking on June 11, 1999 following [[Friday prayers]].{{r|WHO|pg=105}}

From the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in [[Muslim majority countries]] by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a {{"'}}fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to [[Shariah|sharia law]]", and be "a threat to existing government".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boseley |first1=Sarah |title=How tobacco firms tried to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/20/tobacco-firms-tried-undermine-muslim-countries-smoking-ban|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=How tobacco firms try to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/04/21/84683.php|accessdate=5 February 2017|publisher=[[The Bangladesh Observer]]|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tobacco industry]] was also concerned that the [[World Health Organization]]'s encouraging of anti-smoking stance of [[Ulama|Muslim scholars]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: "This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4079">'''''Urreligion''''' is a notion of an "original" or "oldest" form of [[religious tradition]] ({{wikt-lang|de|ur-}} being a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[prefix]] for "original, primitive, elder, primeval, or ''{{wt|en|proto-}}''"). The term contrasts with [[organized religion]], such as the [[theocracy|theocracies]] of the early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|urban]] cultures of the [[Ancient Near East]] or [[major religions|current world religions]].
The term originates in [[German Romanticism]].

==History==
[[Friedrich Creuzer]] put forward the notion of a monotheistic primeval religion  in 1810 - an idea taken up by other authors of the [[Romantic period]], such as [[J. J. Bachofen]],&lt;ref&gt;
In his ''Mutterrecht und Urreligion '', Bachofen connects primeval religion and [[matriarchy]].
&lt;/ref&gt; but decidedly opposed by [[Johann Heinrich Voss]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen. In Vorträgen und Entwürfen.'' Leipzig and Darmstadt, Heyer und Leske, 1810-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Goethe]] in a conversation with [[Eckermann]] on 11 March 1832 discussed the human ''Urreligion'', which he characterized as "pure nature and [pure] reason, of divine origin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang/Gespr%C3%A4che/%5BZu+den+Gespr%C3%A4chen%5D/1832 Gespräche]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final scene of his ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' (1832) has been taken as evoking "the 'Urreligion' of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;
Biblical Borrowings in Goethe's "Faust": A Historical Survey of Their Interpretation, by O. Durrani The Modern Language Review 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Often used in the sense of [[natural religion]] or [[indigenous religion]], the religious behaviour of pre-modern [[tribal societies]] such as [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] (e.g. [[Australian aboriginal mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15220540.600-flood-gave-birth-to-worlds-oldest-religion.html newscientist.com]
&lt;/ref&gt;), the term ''Urreligion'' has also been used by adherents of various religions to back up the claim that their own religion is somehow "primeval" or "older" than competing traditions. In the context of a given religious faith, literal belief in a [[creation myth|creation]] may be the base of primality. (e.g. [[Biblical literalism]], or literal belief in the [[Hindu]] [[Puranas]]).

In particular, [[Urmonotheismus]] comprises the historical claim that primeval religion was [[monotheistic]]. Some have rejected this hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and certain [[Christian apologetics]] circles defend it.&lt;ref&gt;
Pajak, Sylwester, ''Urreligion und Uroffenbarung bei P. W. Schmidt'', St. Augustin 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[Germanic mysticism]] sometimes claimed that the [[Germanic runes]] bore testimony of a primeval religion.&lt;ref&gt;

Some more recent [[new religious movements]] that claim to restore primeval religion include [[Godianism]]&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Veritatis splendor''''' ([[Latin]]: ''The Splendor of the Truth'') is an [[encyclical]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. It expresses the position of the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] regarding fundamentals of the Church's role in moral teaching. The encyclical is one of the most comprehensive and philosophical teachings of moral theology in the Catholic tradition. It was [[Promulgation|promulgated]] on 6 August 1993.

==Summary==
''Veritatis splendor'' responds to questions of [[Ethics in religion|moral theology]] that had been raised during the postconciliar period of the Church (events after the [[Vatican II]] ecumenical council of 1962-65). These questions revolve around man's ability to discern good, the existence of evil, the role of human freedom and human [[conscience]], [[mortal sin]], and the authority of the [[magisterium]] of the Catholic Church in guiding man. In response to these, Pope John Paul II emphatically says that moral truth is knowable, that the choice of good or evil has a profound effect on one's relationship with God, and that there is no true contradiction between freedom and following the good. ''Veritatis splendor'' consists of three chapters: (I) Teacher, What Good Must I Do; (II) Do Not Be Conformed to this World; and (III) Lest the Cross of Christ be Emptied of its Power.

===Response to moral relativism===
''Veritatis splendor'' begins by asserting that there are indeed absolute truths accessible to all persons. Contrary to the philosophy of [[moral relativism]], the encyclical says that moral law is universal across people in varying cultures, and is in fact rooted in the human condition. Pope John Paul teaches that no matter how separated someone is from God, "in the depths of his heart there always remains a yearning for absolute truth and a thirst to attain full knowledge of it." He goes on to say that the splendor of truth "shines forth deep within the human spirit."

===[[Moral authority]] of the Catholic Church===
Ultimately, John Paul teaches, "to ask about the good, in fact, ultimately means to turn towards God, the fullness of goodness." Against the idea that the Church's teaching body has a mainly exhortatory role, the pope reiterates the Catholic doctrine that the magisterium of the Catholic Church has authority to definitively pronounce on moral questions. Even more, John Paul teaches that the Church is Christ's particular response to help answer everyone's question of what is right and wrong.

===Human freedom and divine law===
John Paul teaches that there is no true conflict between human freedom and God's law. The true end of human freedom is growth as a mature person into how each is created by God. Furthermore, God's divine law governing human behavior is not opposed to human freedom, but rather "it protects and promotes that freedom."

The encyclical affirms that today's respect for human freedom "represents one of the positive achievements of modern culture." However, he cautions, though it is a good, human freedom is not in itself an absolute. Merely deciding for oneself that one may do something is not at all a true substitute for determining whether something is in fact good or bad. Because God is the true author of good, it remains of critical importance to understand how the divine Law, as expressed by the authoritative magisterium of the Church, considers an issue before determining absolutely for oneself.

===Natural law===
The pope welcomes and supports the role of human reason in discovering and applying the natural law (those aspects of the moral law that may be discovered without divine revelation). Nevertheless, because God remains the true author of moral law, he states that human reason will not properly supersede the elements of the moral law that are of divine origin—the encyclical states that this "would be the death of true freedom." In particular, John Paul denies those ideas of morality that treat the human body as a "raw datum," separating man and how he uses his body from his greater meaning derived from the entirety of his person.

===The judgment of conscience===
John Paul reiterates the longstanding Catholic teaching that people are obliged to follow their [[conscience]], and that if they do not, they are condemned by their own conscience.

John Paul depicts conscience as a form of inner dialogue. However, he says, it is not merely a dialogue of a man with himself, but it is very much a dialogue between man and God. Following [[Bonaventure]], John Paul likens conscience to a herald from God who proclaims the divine law. In opposition to how it is often represented elsewhere, John Paul says that conscience is emphatically not a replacement for the divine law. Rather, it is the process by which a person may apply the divinely revealed law to the concrete situation at hand.

''Veritatis splendor'' states that because conscience may err in its judgment, a person is obliged to do his best to inform his conscience. Hence, it remains crucial for a person to make an effort to understand what the divine law on a matter is, as expressed by the Church, and the reasons behind it. Even if a person is not condemned by his conscience for a morally wrong act, committing that act nevertheless causes damage in other ways, and if done habitually it can progressively make it harder for a person to perceive the truth. Furthermore, habitual sin enslaves us, so following a wrong judgment of conscience is in the end a step away from freedom.

===The "fundamental option," sin, and salvation===
The encyclical also responds to the idea of the "fundamental option." In this way of thinking, a man's particular actions do not necessarily affect his ultimate salvation—what is important is his fundamental orientation towards or against God. The pope writes:

"There is no doubt that Christian moral teaching, even in its Biblical roots, acknowledges the specific importance of a fundamental choice which qualifies the moral life and engages freedom on a radical level before God. It is a question of the decision of faith, of the obedience of faith (cf. Rom 16:26) "by which man makes a total and free self-commitment to God, offering 'the full submission of intellect and will to God as he reveals' "."&lt;ref&gt;''Veritatis Splendor'', 66&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul firmly opposes the theological assertion that such a fundamental choice can be separated from particular actions, stating that it is contrary to Scripture as well as to long-held Catholic teaching on sin and salvation. He also opposes it on philosophical grounds, writing, "To separate the fundamental option from concrete kinds of behaviour means to contradict the substantial integrity or personal unity of the moral agent in his body and in his soul."

John Paul emphasizes that the "fundamental option" view undermines the traditional Catholic understanding on [[mortal sin]] and [[venial sin]], their distinction, and effects: "For mortal sin exists also when a person knowingly and willingly, for whatever reason, chooses something gravely disordered.... The person turns away from God and loses charity."

===Reality of intrinsically evil acts===
The encyclical also says that certain acts are intrinsically  evil. In the language of Catholic moral theology, this means that certain acts are always wrong, and that there are never circumstances in which they may be permitted if done knowingly and intentionally. Stated another way, this is a strong support for the long-held doctrine of Catholic moral theology that "the ends do not justify the means." John Paul bases this on the argument that certain acts are so destructive to the human person that there are no extenuating circumstances that would allow them. As an example, John Paul specifically mentions the teaching of [[Pope Paul VI]] on contraception, which stipulates that although it is permissible to tolerate a lesser evil to prevent a greater one, or to promote a greater good, it is never permissible, even in the gravest of circumstances to intentionally do an evil so that good may come of it. Or in other words it is never permissible to intend directly something which contradicts a moral order. This reiterates  Paul VI's teaching on contraception, and that if an act is intrinsically evil, a good intention or particular circumstances can diminish their evil, but they cannot remove it.

=== Possibility of obeying the commandments ===
John Paul teaches that man can and must respect the norm of morality even in the most difficult situations: "Temptations can be overcome, sins can be avoided, because together with the commandments the Lord gives us the possibility of keeping them."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 102&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the proposition that the Church's teaching is essentially only an "ideal" which must then be adapted to each case.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 103&lt;/ref&gt;
