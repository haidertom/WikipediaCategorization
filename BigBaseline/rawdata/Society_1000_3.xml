The '''Amethyst Initiative''' is an organization made up of [[Higher education in the United States|U.S. college]] presidents and chancellors that in July 2008 launched a movement calling for the reconsideration of U.S. [[legal drinking age]], particularly the minimum age of 21. The [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984]]  requires all US states to raise their minimum age for purchase and public possession of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to 21 or face a reduction in highway funds under the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act]]. The Amethyst Initiative was initiated by [[John McCardell]], founder of [[Choose Responsibility]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chooseresponsibility.org/cr-news/cr-announces-amethyst-initiative |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203175131/http://blog.chooseresponsibility.org/cr-news/cr-announces-amethyst-initiative/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-03 |title=Choose Responsibility announces Amethyst Initiative |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a former professor of history at [[Middlebury College]] in [[Middlebury, Vermont]] and current Vice-Chancellor of [[Sewanee: The University of the South]], and is currently supported by 136&lt;ref name="theamethystinitiative.org"&gt;http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement/&lt;/ref&gt; college presidents who signed a statement proclaiming, "It’s time to rethink the drinking age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamethystinitiative.org |title=Amethyst Initiative front page|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828030259/http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/| archivedate= 28 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[[The Associated Press]] {{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jWXhmLxHPcv8q_iFiN7nLt7RP8CgD92L2IIO0 |title=College presidents seek debate on drinking age |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821225406/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jWXhmLxHPcv8q_iFiN7nLt7RP8CgD92L2IIO0 |archivedate=21 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] legend, [[amethyst]]s protected their owners from [[drunkenness]].

==Purpose==
The Amethyst Initiative states that, in their experience as university presidents, they have observed, "Alcohol education that mandates [[abstinence]] as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students," and therefore they urge lawmakers "to invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]]s to make responsible decisions about alcohol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement |title=Amethyst Initiative » Statement|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080902032504/http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement| archivedate= 2 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustavus Adolphus College]] President Jack R. Ohle said in a statement that the initiative is not about lowering the drinking age, but to open a debate on alcohol policies that affect young people and their choices about alcohol use. {{quotation|We need serious, sustained, unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned. I signed the statement in hopes that it would encourage debate on our campus about the seriousness of drinking in general but more importantly the high-risk drinking that has become so common on college campuses today. As an educator, I feel a responsibility to encourage a discussion about responsibility. That responsibility rests with not only the students but with those of us who work to provide for their education, safety, and well being. We must engage in civil, informed, and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gustavus.edu/news/4168 |title=Statement from President Ohle Regarding Amethyst Initiative | publisher =  Gustavus Adolphus College |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Statement ==
The Amethyst Initiative states the following:&lt;ref name="theamethystinitiative.org"/&gt;

{{blockquote|'''It’s time to rethink the drinking age'''
In 1984 Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which imposed a penalty of 10% of a state's federal highway appropriation on any state setting its drinking age lower than 21.

Twenty-four years later, our experience as college and university presidents convinces us that…

'''Twenty-one is not working'''

A culture of dangerous, clandestine “binge-drinking”—often conducted off-campus—has developed.

Alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students.

Adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting, signing contracts, serving on juries and enlisting in the military, but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer.

By choosing to use fake IDs, students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law.

'''How many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition?'''

We call upon our elected officials:

To support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age.

To consider whether the 10% highway fund “incentive” encourages or inhibits that debate.

To invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol.

We pledge ourselves and our institutions to playing a vigorous, constructive role as these critical discussions unfold.}}

==Public reaction==
The initiative's proposal has been criticized by several groups and government and industry officials, including [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD). Joining MADD's criticism are other groups, including the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], the [[American Medical Association]], and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]].&lt;ref name="MADD PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-19-2008/0004869764&amp;EDATE= |title=MADD press release: Some University Presidents Shirk Responsibility to Protect Students from Dangers of Underage Drinking |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823001726/http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F08-19-2008%2F0004869764&amp;EDATE= |archivedate=23 August 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A spokesman for the [[Governors Highway Safety Association]] told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that university leaders "are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/20/AR2008082003626.html?sub=new "Lower drinking age is criticized"] (free registration required), ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, Amethyst Initiative's parent organization, Choose Responsibility, proposes that only [[high school graduate]]s should be eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/proposal |title=Choose Responsibility: drinking age proposals|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release, MADD argues that lowering the drinking age would result in greater numbers of fatal automobile accidents, and that the presidents are "looking for an easy way out of an inconvenient problem" and "misrepresenting science."&lt;ref name="MADD PR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madd.org/Article-Archive/2008/August/Article---Amethyst-Initiative-Underage-Drinking-Re.aspx |title=Mothers Against Drunk Driving - Amethyst Initiative Underage Drinking Response |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107101240/http://www.madd.org/Article-Archive/2008/August/Article---Amethyst-Initiative-Underage-Drinking-Re.aspx |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MADD cited former [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] Secretary, and current [[University of Miami]] president [[Donna Shalala]] statement that "maintaining the legal drinking age at 21 is a socially and medically sound policy that helps parents, schools and law enforcement protect our youth from the potentially life-threatening effects of underage drinking."&lt;ref name="MADD PR"/&gt;
 
[[Choose Responsibility]] argues that scientific evidence supports the Amethyst Initiative's views and goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17294/1/2638 |title=Legal Age 21 - National Minimum Drinking Age - FAQ with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17305/1/2643 |title=Drinking and Culture: International Comparisons with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17312/1/2648 |title=Drunken Driving Fatalities with citations|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refutes some of MADD's past claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/myths_realities_c/ |title=Myths and Realities about drinking with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/19785/1/2635/ |title=Not Convinced? |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford Ungar, president of Goucher College and signee of the initiative argues that opponents should not fear because the Amethyst Initiative is about opening up the debate to improve alcohol policy. He brings about the misconception that they want to "polarize" the issue at hand, but instead wishes to find a better alternative to the current drinking age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-span.org/video/?280945-7/changing-drinking-age-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Radley Balko, of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],'' wryly noted inconsistency opponents of the Amethyst Initiative believe that it "would be a "national tragedy" to, for example, allow 19- and 20-year-old men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to have a beer in celebration of completing their tours of duty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Balko | first =Radley  | title =Amethyst Initiative's Debate on Drinking a Welcome Alternative to Fanaticism | newspaper =[[Fox News]] | date =August 25, 2008| url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,410283,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Balko also noted research showing that underage drinking laws had not reduced highway deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Miron | first =Jeffrey A.  |first2=Elina |last2=Tetelbaum |year=2009 |title=Does The Minimum Legal Drinking Age Save Lives? |journal=[[Economic Inquiry]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=317–336 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.2008.00179.x |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4319664/Miron_MinDrinkAgeLives.pdf?sequence=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, the Student Senate at the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]] rejected a proposal to urge that university's chancellor to sign the Amethyst Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2008/11/13/news/z09drinking.txt "UW–L students say no to drinking age debate],''[[La Crosse Tribune]]'', Retrieved on 2008-12-15&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly the first such attempt by a student body to ask a president or chancellor to sign on, the measure at [[UW–L]] was defeated 14-19 after three weeks' debate. Chancellor Joe Gow said this vote, "certainly defies the 'conventional wisdom' regarding young people being eager to lower the drinking age."&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.theracquet.net/media/storage/paper978/news/2008/11/19/News/Amethyst.Initiative.Debate.Finally.Over-3550675.shtml "Amethyst Initiative debate finally over],''[[The Racquet]]'', Retrieved on 2008-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a pair of researchers published a [[literature review]] in [[Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs]] of studies on the effect of the drinking age in response to the Amethyst Initiative; the review indicates support for the drinking age remaining at 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeJong|first1=W|last2=Blanchette|first2=J|title=Case closed: research evidence on the positive public health impact of the age 21 minimum legal drinking age in the United States.|journal=Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs.

{{Criminal law}}
An '''assault''' is the act of inflicting physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or, in some specific legal definitions, a threat or attempt to commit such an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/assault-and-battery-overview.html|title=Assault and Battery Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=criminal.findlaw.com|publisher=|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a [[crime]] and a [[tort]] and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and [[Assault (tort)|tort law]]. 

Traditionally, [[common law]] legal systems had separate definitions for assault and '''[[Battery (crime)|battery]]'''. When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into '''assault and battery''', which then became widely referred to as "assault". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. The legal systems of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots law]] have never distinguished assault from battery.

Legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. In the [[United States]], an assault can be charged as either a [[misdemeanor]] or a [[felony]]. In [[England and Wales]] and [[Australia]], it can be charged as either [[common assault]], [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) or [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH). [[Canada]] also has a three-tier system: assault, [[assault causing bodily harm]] and [[aggravated assault]]. Separate charges typically exist for [[sexual assault]]s, [[affray]] and [[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty|assaulting a police officer]]. Assault may overlap with an [[attempt]]ed crime; for example an assault may be charged as an [[attempted murder]] if it was done with intent to kill.

==Related definitions==

===Battery===
In jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two, assault usually accompanies [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat. See [[common assault]]. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act&lt;ref&gt;An act is volitional if it is purposeful and deliberate as opposed to reflexive or involuntary (see Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams, ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2012) at p 901. For example. a person who has restless leg syndrome kicks his wife while asleep. The contact, although, harmful, would not constitute battery because the act was not wilful.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.&lt;ref&gt;A criminal battery may also be committed if the harmful or offensive contact is due to the criminal negligence of the defendant.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting them is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.

===Aggravated assault===
[[Aggravation (legal concept)|Aggravated]] assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a [[deadly weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime in the United States 2010: Aggravated Assault |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/aggravatedassaultmain}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to:
* cause serious bodily injury to another person with a deadly weapon&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Dennis|last2=William|first2=Glanville|title=Textbook of Criminal Law|publisher=London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have sexual relations with a person who is under the age of consent
* cause bodily harm by recklessly operating a [[motor vehicle]] during [[road rage]]; often referred to as either '''vehicular assault''' or '''aggravated assault with a motor vehicle.'''

Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.

==Defenses==
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:

===Consent===
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as [[de minimis]] harm. Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.

[[consent (criminal law)|Consent]] may be a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;(RvG ref 6. 1980): see{{cite web|url=http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non+Fatal+Assaults/Consent+R+v+Brown.htm |title=R v Brown (1993) 2 All ER 75 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016125514/http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20R%20v%20Brown.htm |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic sexual activity]], the most notable case being the [[Operation Spanner]] case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game ([[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], or [[contact sports]]), bodily adornment (''R v Wilson'' [1996] Crim LR 573), or horseplay (''R v Jones'' [1987] Crim LR 123). However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish law, consent is not a defense for assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotHC/1975/1975_JC_30.html|title=''Smart v. H. M. Advocate'', [1975&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ScotHC HCJ_1, 1975 SLT 65, 1975 JC 30.|author=|date=|website=bailii.org|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and other official acts===
[[Police officers]] and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an [[arrest]] or generally carrying out their official duties. Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.

===Punishment===
In some jurisdictions such as [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[judicial corporal punishment]] is part of the [[legal system]]. The officers who administer the punishment have [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from prosecution for assault.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, [[Corporal punishment in the home#Where corporal punishment in the home is lawful|corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian]] is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable. What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and [[case law]]. Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for [[child abuse]].

Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of corporal punishment for [[School corporal punishment|children in school]]. In [[English law]], s.&amp;nbsp;58 [[Children Act 2004]] limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s.&amp;nbsp;39 [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

===Prevention of crime===
This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.

===Defense of property===
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in [[Defence of property|defense of property]], to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] it may be argued that the defendant has a ''lawful excuse'' to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]) subject to the need to deter [[vigilante]]s and excessive self-help. Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder. The resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruder's presence.

This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Regional details==

===Canada===
Assault is an offence under s. 265 of the  Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref name=1985-46&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |title=CanLII - Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 |publisher= |accessdate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430001252/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |archivedate=30 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur. Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.

The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt; This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.

Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:

* Assault: The offence is defined by section 265 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]] Section 267(b) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].

An individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.

===India===
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php#s351|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; sections 351 through 358.
{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - "Indian Penal Code"|accessdate=2 Mar 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205035155/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|archive-date=5 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Code further explains that "mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault". Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350). The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.

===Nigeria===
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2029|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act. Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2025|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Islands===
'''Marshall Islands'''

The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ Criminal Code [31 MIRC Ch 1&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413025838/http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person is guilty of this offence if they unlawfully offer or attempt, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.

===Republic of Ireland===
Section 2 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]] creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

===South Africa===
[[South African law]] does not draw the distinction between assault and battery. ''Assault'' is a [[common law crime]] defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him". The law also recognises the crime of ''assault with intent to cause [[grievous bodily harm]]'', where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Milton |title=South African Criminal Law and Procedure: Common-law crimes |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta &amp; Co |year=1996 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-7021-3773-0 |pages=405–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common law crime of ''[[indecent assault]]'' was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]], and replaced by a statutory crime of ''[[sexual assault]]''.

===United Kingdom===
;Piracy with violence: Section 2 of the [[Piracy Act 1837]] provides that it is an offence, amongst other things, for a person, with intent to commit or at the time of or immediately before or immediately after committing the crime of piracy in respect of any ship or vessel, to assault, with intent to [[Murder in English law|murder]], any person being on board of or belonging to such ship or vessel.

;Assaulting a member of an international joint investigation team: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/57 section 57(2)] of the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].

;Attacks on UN Staff workers: Section 1(2)(a) of the [[United Nations Personnel Act 1997]] (c.13) makes provision for assault causing injury, and section 1(2)(b) makes provision for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, on UN staff.
;Assault by person committing an offence under the Night Poaching Act 1828: This offence is created by section 2 of the [[Night Poaching Act 1828]].

Abolished offences:

;Assault on customs and excise officers, etc.: Section 16(1)(a) of the [[Customs and Excise Management Act 1979]] (c.2) provided that it was an offence to, amongst other things, assault any person duly engaged in the performance of any duty or the exercise of any power imposed or conferred on him by or under any enactment relating to an assigned matter, or any person acting in his aid. For the meaning of "assault" in this provision, see Logdon v. DPP [1976] Crim LR 121, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|DC]]. This offence was abolished and replaced by the [[Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005]].
;Assaulting a person designated under section 43 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005: This offence was created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/51 section 51(1)] of the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]]. It related to officers of the [[Serious Organized Crime Agency]] and was repealed when that agency was abolished.

====England and Wales====
{{See also|Battery (crime)#England and Wales}}

English law provides for two offences of assault: [[common assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. ''Violence'' in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of [[battery (crime)|battery]], even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

A [[common assault]] is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the [[Crown Court]]). Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.

=====Aggravated assaults=====
An assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing "actual bodily harm" (ABH) or, in the severest cases, "[[grievous bodily harm]]" (GBH).
;[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]: The offence of is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Inflicting [[grievous bodily harm]]: Also referred to as "malicious wounding" or "unlawful wounding". This offence is created by section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.
;Causing grievous bodily harm with intent: Also referred to as "wounding with intent". This offence is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

Other aggravated assault charges refer to assaults carried out against a specific target or with a specific intent:
;Assault with intent to rob: The penalty for [[assault with intent to rob]], a common law offence, is provided by section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated common assault: This offence is created by section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm: This offence is created by section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Assault with intent to resist arrest: The offence of [[assault with intent to resist arrest]] is created by section 38 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;[[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty]]: Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides that it is an offence for a person to assault either:
:*a [[constable]] acting in the execution of his duty; or
:*a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
;Assaulting a traffic officer: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/18/section/10 section 10(1)] of the [[Traffic Management Act 2004]].
;Assaulting a person designated or accredited under sections 38 or 39 or 41 or 41A of the Police Reform Act 2002: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/46 section 46(1)] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]]. Those sections relate respectively to persons given police powers by a chief police officer, detention contractors retained by police, accredited contractors under a community safety accreditation scheme, and weights and measures inspectors.
;Assault on a prison custody officer: This offence is created by section 90(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]] (c.53).
;Assault on a secure training centre custody officer: This offence is created by section 13(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] (c.33).
;Assault on officer saving wreck: This offence is created by section 37 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Assaulting an officer of the court: This offence is created by section 14(1)(b) of the [[County Courts Act 1984]].
;Cruelty to persons under sixteen: Section 1(1) of the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]] provides that it is an offence for a person who has attained the age of sixteen years, and who has responsibility for a child or young person under that age, to, amongst other things, wilfully assault that child or young person, or to cause or procure that child or young person to be assaulted, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health.
;Sexual assault: The offence of [[Sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. It is not defined in terms of the offences of common assault or battery. It instead requires intentional touching and the absence of a reasonable belief in consent.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law]], assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Criminal Law'' (5th edn, 1948) p.155&lt;/ref&gt; There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a ''physical'' attack on another's person, as demonstrated in ''Atkinson v. [[Lord Advocate|HM Advocate]]''&lt;ref&gt;1987 SCCR 534&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a [[ski mask]]. The court said:

{{quote|[A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm|Atkinson v. HM Advocate (1987)}}

Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or ''Hamesuken'' (to assault a person in their own home). The ''[[mens rea]]'' for assault is simply "evil intent",&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, op. cit, p.155; Smart v. HM Advocate 1975 JC 30&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been held to mean no more than that assault "cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently" as upheld in ''[[Lord Advocate's Reference]] No 2 of 1992'' where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.

It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty, under  Section 90, Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (previously Section 41 of the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]]) which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty.

====Northern Ireland====
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offences of:
* Common assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 42;
* Aggravated assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 43
* Common assault: under section 47
* Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: under section 47
The [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]] creates the offences of:
* Assault with intent to resist arrest: under section 7(1)(b); this offence was formerly created by s.38 of the OAPA 1861.

That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under section 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

=== Australia ===
The term 'assault', when used in legislation, commonly refers to both common assault and battery, even though the two offences remain distinct. Common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force, whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|431|2004|litigants=Darby v DPP |parallelcite=(2004) 61 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 558 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has legislation relating to the act of assault, and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the Magistrates Court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a District or Supreme Court of that State. The legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault, where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes, and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4274/assault-laws-in-australia-definitions-and-defences.aspx|title=Assault Laws in Australia: Definitions and Defences|website=www.findlaw.com.au|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, the Crimes Act 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties. These include:

====Assault with further specific intent====
* Acts done to the person with intent to murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wounding or grievous bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use or possession of a weapon to resist arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault causing certain injuries====
* Actual bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|59}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the term is not defined in the ''Crimes Act'', but case law indicates actual bodily harm may include injuries such as bruises and scratches,&lt;ref name="AustLII"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|305|2009|litigants=R v McIntyre |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as psychological injuries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|442|2005|litigants=Li v R |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; if the injury inflicted is more than merely transient (the injury does not necessarily need to be permanent)&lt;ref&gt;''R v Donovan'' [1934] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 498; [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/cases/NZPoliceLawRp/1934/8.pdf (1934) 5 New Zealand Police Law Reports 247].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wounding &lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|35}}(4).&lt;/ref&gt; - where there is breaking of the skin;&lt;ref name="AustLII"/&gt;
* Grievous bodily harm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|35}}(2).&lt;/ref&gt; - which includes the destruction of a foetus, permanent or serious disfiguring, and transmission of a grievous bodily disease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|Felony Sentences in State Courts, study by the United States Department of Justice.]]

In the United States,{{where|date=September 2018}}&lt;!-- federal? some states? all states and territories? including Louisiana which did not incorporate English common law? --&gt; assault may be defined as an attempt to commit a [[battery (crime)|battery]]. However, the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended, but the defendant's act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault is typically treated as a [[misdemeanor]] and not as a [[felony]] (unless the victim is a [[Police|law enforcement]] officer){{fact|date=September 2018}}, or in New York State for example if the offender is a repeat offender. As a misdemeanor, however, it can still result in incarceration and in a criminal record. The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.

Four elements were required at [[common law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atoki|first1=Morayo|title=Assault and S 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law|date=1995|volume=59|issue=3|page=301|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002201839505900307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The apparent, present ability to carry out;
# An unlawful attempt;
# To commit a violent injury; 
# Upon another.

Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault. In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.

As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.

Laws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Modern American statutes may define assault as including:
* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another 
* [[negligently]] causing bodily injury to another with a dangerous weapon (assault with a deadly weapon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&amp;Statute=22-18-1|title=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* causing bodily harm by reckless operation of a [[motor vehicle]] (vehicular assault).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.522|title=RCW 46.61.522: Vehicular assault  —  Penalty.|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as demonstrated below.

In [[Kansas]] the law on assault states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |title=KS Statutes: Ch 21 Article 34: Crimes Against Persons |date=2007-11-14 |access-date=2016-09-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114225316/http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |archivedate=14 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Assault is intentionally placing another person in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.}}

In [[New York State]], assault (as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/120.05|title=Article 120 - NY Penal Law - Assault Menacing Stalking - Law|publisher=New York State Senate|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires an actual injury. Other states define this as battery; there is no crime of battery in New York. However, in New York if a person threatens another person with imminent injury without engaging in physical contact, that is called "menacing". A person who engages in that behavior is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree (a [[misdemeanor|Class A misdemeanor]]; punishable with up to one year [[incarceration]], [[probation]] for an extended time, and a permanent [[criminal record]]) when they threaten to cause physical harm to another person, and guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree (a [[Class E felony]]) if they have a previous conviction for the same offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-240-30.html|title=New York Consolidated Laws, Penal Law - PEN § 240.30 - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-harassment-laws.html|title=New York Harassment Laws - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/opinion/when-is-a-threat-a-criminal-act.html|title=Opinion - When Is a Threat a Criminal Act?|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.new-york-lawyers.org/second-degree-aggravated-harassment.html|title=Second Degree Aggravated Harassment|author=|date=|website=The Law Office of Crotty &amp; Saland|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York also has specific laws against [[hazing]], when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.

[[North Dakota]] law states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t12-1c17.pdf?20130902151232|title=North Dakota Century Code t12.1c17|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Simple assault.
# A person is guilty of an offense if that person:{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha
| Willfully causes bodily injury to another human being; or
| Negligently causes bodily injury to another human being by means of a firearm, destructive device, or other weapon, the use of which against a human being is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury.}}}}

In [[Tennessee]] assault is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/|title=LexisNexis® Custom Solution: Tennessee Code Research Tool|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|39-13-101.  Assault.{{plainlist|
*(a) A person commits assault who:
*(1) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another;
*(2) Intentionally or knowingly causes another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury; or
*(3) Intentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another and a reasonable person would regard the contact as extremely offensive or provocative.}}}}

States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double [[inchoate offense]].

In some states, [[consent (criminal law)|consent]] is a complete defense to assault. In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a ''petty misdemeanor''.

Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human. Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man. However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See [http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212].

Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:
* A defendant could argue that since they were drunk, they could not form the [[specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail, however, since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.
* A defendant could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior.

===Ancient Greece===
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed [[hubris]]. Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.

Violations of the law against hubris included, what would today be termed, assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1976) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.

Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.

The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[Atë]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of their hubris, or great pride, that leads to their death or downfall.

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame. The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

[[Image:CPAS building.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at the Australian National University in Canberra]]
The '''Centre for the Public Awareness of Science''' is part of the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Centre for the Public Awareness of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000 it became an accredited Centre for the Australian National Commission for [[UNESCO]].

==Work of the Centre==

As a [[UNESCO]] Centre, CPAS engages with [[science communication]] and communicators in the Pacific region and beyond.  In partnership with the [[UNESCO]] Pacific Office in [[Apia]], [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=36986&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Pacific Office in Apia, Samoa]&lt;/ref&gt; CPAS has focused on science teaching training and communication in Pacific nations.  As well as running a science journalism workshop for [[Pacific Island]] journalists in 2001, CPAS  followed up in the same year with a science teacher workshop and the first Pacific Science Communication Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Pacific Science Communication Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] office in [[Jakarta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.or.id UNESCO Office in Jakarta, Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; invited CPAS to join a mission to [[Cambodia]] to conduct a survey to identify and assess the needs of the country with respect to science education in schools and universities. Other activities include joining with [[UNESCO]] ([[Apia]]) to help in its aims to raise social participation in science in and around the Pacific.

CPAS also established, as a pilot project, the Register of Pacific Scientists, an online database for those involved with Pacific Science to record their details and/or search for other people with similar or complementary interests. 

Other activities of CPAS include the presentation of workshops for secondary school science teachers and others in [[Fiji]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]]. A joint teaching program is being developed with the [[National University of Singapore]]. In [[South Africa]], CPAS helped to develop a touring hands-on science exhibition and has been invited to work in and with various [[South African]] science centres.

==Teaching, Outreach and Research==

With a flourishing graduate program, CPAS encourages research in all aspects of [[science communication]]. Degrees are offered at all tertiary levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php CPAS Academic Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113805/http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outreach programs within Australia include workshops for research scientists, science teachers, science and engineering students and science centre personnel, as well as the ANU Shell [[Questacon]] Science Circus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/sqsc.html ANU Shell Questacon Science Circus]&lt;/ref&gt; 

CPAS has a wide research program dealing with issues at the interface of science and the public. Apart from a long-standing agenda of research in science centres, CPAS is concerned with current issues in science, with the communication agendas of scientists, and with effective communication of science concepts. The research program is interdisciplinary and contributes to the emerging framework of [[science communication]] theory.

==History==

CPAS was launched by Professor [[Richard Dawkins]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/about/CPAS_launch.php CPAS Launch]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It owes it origin to the establishment, twenty years earlier, of a modest science centre in a vacant primary school in [[Canberra]]. This burgeoning science centre eventually grew into [[Questacon]] – The National Science and Technology Centre. [[Questacon]] was the brainchild of [[Mike Gore (physicist)|Michael Gore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike Prof. Michael Gore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior lecturer in Physics at the Australian National University, who became its first director. An important part of its activities was outreach, supported from the beginning by sponsorship from [[Shell Australia]].

Dr Gore approached Professor Chris Bryant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris Prof. Chris Bryant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then Dean of Science at the [[Australian National University]], with a proposal to set up a science circus to travel Australia, to be staffed by graduate science students enrolled in a course of [[science communication]]. Thus was born the Graduate Certificate in Science Communication that rapidly metamorphosed into a Graduate Diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php CPAS Graduate Diploma in Science Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629085932/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php |date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative proved extremely popular and it became clear that there was a hitherto undetected demand for such a course. Over the next few years, Masters and PhD courses were offered and science communication became a full-fledged graduate program.

By 1994, the demand was so great that the Faculty of Science at the [[Australian National University]] agreed to fund a Lectureship in [[Science Communication]]. This was the first in Australia and, possibly, the world. Dr [[Susan Stocklmayer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue Dr Susan Stocklmayer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to the position and immediately announced her intention of establishing a university centre for [[science communication]].  The Centre was established in 1996, with Professor Bryant as its first, interim, Director. Dr Stocklmayer took over the position in 1998, where she remains today.

==Awards==

In subsequent years, the work of CPAS has been recognised by a number of awards and honours: In 1999, CPAS, [[Shell Australia]] and [[Questacon]] jointly won the Business/Higher Education Round Table&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhert.com/ Business/Higher Education Round Table]&lt;/ref&gt; Award. The citation commends CPAS as “a university centre whose brief is to empower Australians by encouraging in them the confidence of 'ownership' of modern science. It is intended to increase science awareness in the Australian community and to improve communication skills of scientists.”  In 2000, its standing was such that it was designated as the first UNESCO Centre for Science Communication.

In 2004, the triple partnership was awarded the Financial Review National Award for long term sponsorship, and in 2006 it won the Special Award for Excellence in the Prime Ministers Community Business Partnerships. The individual contributions of members of CPAS have also been widely recognised and they have received many personal accolades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5985">In catering, '''beverage functions''' are [[social event|function]]s where beverages are served.

== Who pays ==
One important issue of beverage functions is who pays for the drinks.&lt;ref name=Idiots&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Meeting and Event Planning|author=Robin E. Craven and Lynn Johnson Golabowski|pages=192|publisher=Alpha Books|date=2001|isbn13=9780028640044}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main scenarios:
*a cash bar (a.k.a. a no-host bar): Attendees pay for their own drinks.&lt;ref name=Idiots/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|article=cash bar|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Travel, Tourism and Hospitality|author=S. Medlik|pages=33|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|date=2003|isbn13=9780750656504}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a cash bar with tickets: The host issues vouchers to attendees for a limited number of free drinks, and attendees pay for any further drinks themselves.&lt;ref name=Idiots/&gt;
*a host bar (a.k.a. an open bar): The host pays for all drinks, either by the hour, by the bottle, by the drink, or per person.&lt;ref name=Idiots/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|article=host bar|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Travel, Tourism and Hospitality|author=S. Medlik|pages=86|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|date=2003|isbn13=9780750656504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackTie/&gt;

Choosing among the several options is influenced by several factors.  One such factor is etiquette. Providing a cash bar at a function such as a wedding reception is generally considered poor etiquette in the United States.&lt;ref name=Leigh&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Plan Your Own Wedding and Save Thousands|author=Tracy Leigh|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|date=2008|isbn13=9781601380074|pages=207&amp;ndash;208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such factor is cost. A cash bar is the least expensive option for a host. However, there are alternatives between a cash bar and a fully open bar that can limit costs. The host can set a hard limit on cost, beyond which all beverages have to be paid for by attendees. The host can specify that specific beverages, such as a few selected types of wines and beers, are paid for by the host, and that attendees pay for all other types of drinks. The host can set a time limit for an open bar, beyond which it reverts to being a cash bar. Or more complex combinations of these can be employed.&lt;ref name=Leigh/&gt;

Some venues, such as hotels, subject to the terms of their [[liquor license]]s, may allow attendees to bring their own alcoholic drinks to beverage functions. However, they may also charge attendees a fee, usually charged per bottle (either at a flat rate or as a percentage of the bottle's price), for doing so, known as [[corkage]].&lt;ref name=BlackTie/&gt;

Cash bars have their problems for caterers and venue managers. One major problem is the possibility of theft. To prevent this, managers can set up cashiers, who take money and issue drinks tickets, separate from the serving staff who actually serve drinks. Brown and Godsmark recommend to managers that they place only their most trustworthy staff in charge of the cash bars at banquets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Food Service Manager's Guide to Creative Cost Cutting|author=Douglas Robert Brown|pages=460|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|date=2005|isbn13=9780910627610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controlling Liquor, Wine &amp;amp; Beverage Costs|author=Douglas Robert Brown and Elizabeth Godsmark|pages=123|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|date=2002|isbn13=9780910627184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, open bars have problems for hosts, in that they can result in an increased number of intoxicated, and potentially obnoxious and aggressive, attendees, as compared to other options. With open bars, the level of waste also increases (which is reflected in increased costs to the host). Since attendees do not pay for their drinks, they often do not consider them to be as valuable as they would if they had paid for them themselves. This results in drinks being abandoned or forgotten, or simply discarded by guests who leave their drinks (as they go and do something else) after only partly consuming them and then replace them with fresh ones rather than finishing the drinks that they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Everything Wedding Organizer|author=Shelly Hagen|pages=135&amp;ndash;138|publisher=Everything Books|date=2006|isbn13=9781593376406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=E-Plan Your Wedding|author=Crystal Melendez and Jason Melendez|pages=218|publisher=Mediasoft Press|date=2007|isbn13=9781933457000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of drinks served ==
The types of drinks served at functions can vary, according to the type of the event, and the types and ages of the attendees.  In particular, at wedding receptions whether the bride and groom are themselves alcohol drinkers can affect whether attendees pay for their own alcoholic drinks, or indeed whether alcohol is offered at all. Similarly, alcohol is not served at beverage events for children.&lt;ref name=Leigh/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackTie/&gt;

Another factor that affects whether alcohol is served is liability, for subsequent intoxication and anything that results from it. Many U.S. jurisdictions allow the victims of accidents to sue not only the person who was intoxicated, but also the person who served the alcohol, the person or company employing the bartender, and the board of directors of the company.&lt;ref name=BlackTie&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Tie Optional|author=Harry A. Freedman and Karen Feldman|pages=122&amp;ndash;123|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|date=2007|isbn13=9780470116814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mad Friday''', '''Frantic Friday''' or '''Black Eye Friday''' is a nickname for the last [[Friday]] before [[Christmas]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

It is the most popular night for office and factories Christmas parties, which consequently makes it one of the busiest nights in the year for ambulances and the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7157423.stm BBC News, 22 December 2007: "'Black Friday' keeps police busy"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7792652.stm BBC News, 20 December 2008: "'Black Friday' keeps crews busy"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/dec/18/black-friday-party The Guardian, 18 December 2008: "Ambulance service braced for 'Black Friday'"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursingtimes.net/whats-new-in-nursing/warning-over-alcohol-at-christmas-parties-as-black-friday-for-999-calls-looms/1954076.article Nursing Times, 18 December 2008: "Warning over alcohol at christmas parties as 'Black Friday. for 999 calls looms"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12012042 BBC News Wales, 17 December 2010: "Second snow band brings disruption across much of Wales"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The term Black Friday originates as "jargon" used by NHS and Police, and has entered the popular lexicon. From 2013, the press began to use the term Mad Friday&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2527748/Emergency-services-busy-night-Mad-Friday-descends.html Daily Mail, 22 December 2013: "'Mad Friday' fallout: Emergency services inundated as drinkers descend on towns and cities on last weekend before Christmas"] Linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Mad Friday': Christmas revellers given alcohol warning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35135284|website=BBC News|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|History|reason=I've known the term to be used as long as I've worked in the licensed trade since the mid-00s, and presumably predates that|date=November 2017}} to avoid confusion with the American [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] in November, which was growing increasingly popular in the UK due to marketing by American retailers.

In parts of the [[United Kingdom]], the day has been referred to as Black Eye Friday, due to unusually high number of fights that break out in bars, pubs and clubs in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/cumbrian-police-braced-for-black-eye-friday-1.286376?firstComment=0&amp;commentview=1 The Cumberland News, 18 December 2008: "Cumbrian Police braced for Black Eye Friday"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211124831/http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/cumbrian-police-braced-for-black-eye-friday-1.286376?firstComment=0&amp;commentview=1 |date=December 11, 2014 }} Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumbriacrack.com/2011/12/14/police-crackdown-on-violence-in-the-countdown-to-black-eye-friday/ Cumbria Crack, 14 December 2011: "Police crackdown on violence in the countdown to ‘Black Eye Friday’"] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.real-whitby.co.uk/black-eyed-friday-by-helen-hutchinson Real Whitby, 7 December 2012: ''Black Eyed Friday In Whitby''] Re-linked 2014-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes called Builders' Friday, as it is the last day of work for many construction workers.

==Safety concerns and preventive measures==

In anticipation of the festivities, police and emergency services officials begin their preparations for Black Friday early in December.  Ambulance Trusts around the country plan and set up mobile "drunk tanks" in city centres to help lighten the load on hospitals and police cells.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harley|first1=Nicola|title=Mad Friday: How police and hospitals are preparing|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11301825/Mad-Friday-How-police-and-hospitals-are-preparing.html|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the higher end mobile units can treat up to 11 people at a time with eight beds, seats with restraint straps and two showers, and can cost up to £500,000.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph" /&gt; In Manchester, temporary metal detectors, or "knife arches", are erected in the busiest parts of the city to assure the public that no weapons of any kind will be tolerated.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Greater Manchester Police prepare for 'Mad Friday'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-12015682|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media===

In December 2013, Greater Manchester Police promoted the hashtag #MadMancFriday to expose some of the embarrassing things that revellers would do, in the hopes of discouraging them from getting so publicly drunk again next year.&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Evan|title=Mad Friday: Binge-drinking, arrests and dancing with office chairs...Britain at its worst on its busiest night before Christmas|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/21/mad-friday-binge-drinking-arrests-and-dancing-with-office-chairs-britain-at-its-worst-on-busiest-night-before-christmas-4239554/|accessdate=June 23, 2015|publisher=Metro News UK|date=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brand engagement''' is the process of forming an emotional or rational attachment between a [[consumer]] and a [[brand]].  It comprises one aspect of [[brand management]].

==External==

Brand engagement between a brand and its consumers/potential consumers is a key objective of a [[brand marketing]] effort.

In general, the ways a brand connects to its consumer is via a range of "[[touchpoint]]s"—that is, a sequence or list of potential ways the brand makes contact with the individual.  Examples include retail environments, advertising, word of mouth, online, and the product/service itself.
&lt;!--This section needs development--&gt;

==Internal ("close stakeholder")==

There are two broad areas where brand engagement is relevant within an organization (employees and close stakeholders such as franchise staff, call centers, suppliers or intermediaries).

The first area is ensuring that the [[employer brand]] promised to employees is delivered upon once employees join the firm. If the employee experience is not what is promised, this could result in increased [[employee turnover]] and/or decreased performance.

The second area is ensuring employees and close stakeholders of an organization completely understand the organization's brand, and what it stands for—and to make sure that their activities on a day-to-day basis are contributing to expressing that brand through the customer experience.

In general, this requires an ongoing effort on the part of the organization to ensure that its employees and close stakeholders understand what the brand is promising to its customers, and to help all employees clearly understand how their actions and behaviors, on a day-to-day basis, either support or undermine the effort.

This often raises the issue of the value of investment in "brand engagement". It is a discretionary expense on the part of the organization.  Proponents of brand engagement would argue that this is an investment—that is, the benefits to the organization outweigh the cost of the program.

Within any organization there is competition for resources, so there is a significant need to demonstrate [[return on investment]] in [[employee engagement]]/internal communications. While it is generally accepted that it is important for [[internal communications]] professionals to demonstrate the value this function delivers to the organization, it is difficult to place a discrete figure on this contribution.

Best practice in internal communications generally adheres to certain principles:

* Understanding the stakeholder (audiences)
* Knowing what messages and information is appropriate for each audience
* Ensuring that there is a feedback mechanism in place so communication is a dialogue
* Measuring effectiveness
* Enhancing participation and collaboration.

An aspect of internal brand engagement is [[brand orientation]] which refers to "the degree to which the organization values brands and its practices are oriented towards building brand capabilities."

Thought leaders are increasingly placing employee engagement at the forefront of the fight for greater authenticity in the workplace, increased employee satisfaction and ultimately greater retention and improved customer service.  They are passionate about the link to bottom line benefits and strongly advocate working on brands from the inside out.  There are a range of experts and service providers who have created offers to bring the brand to life—all agree that the employee side of the equation is far more important than has been historically acknowledged.

==The measurement angle==

Much internal communication and employee engagement practice is based on measurement of effectiveness or business contribution.  The key elements in creating a model of employee engagement is the measurement of "engagement drivers"—that is, what are the factors or combinations of factors which affect productivity and commitment and can be monitored and addressed through people, process or technology changes?

Many of the “engagement drivers” currently in use internally are HR focused, and in many cases do not delve deeply into the employee’s role in delivering the brand/[[customer experience]] as a distinct element.

==Example==

Probably the most compelling example of this is the [[service-profit chain]]. The first real case study of this appeared in "[[The Service Profit Chain]]" (the so-called Sears Model, Harvard Business Review, 1997). This statistical model tracks increases in employee “engagement drivers” to correlated increases in customer satisfaction and loyalty, and then correlates this to increases in [[total shareholder return]] (TSR), revenue and other financial performance measures.

Since the service-profit chain emerged, it’s been developed, and criticized, but the general consensus is that employee engagement can contribute roughly 20% to an organization’s TSR (various Vivaldi, Watson Wyatt, [[Towers Perrin]] studies 2004, 2005, 2006).

==Collaboration and connectivity vs. content management==

While some organizations are realizing the benefits of collaboration and work flow online, there appears to be significant focus on publishing and managing content, generally via [[content management system]]s.

There is an emerging school of thought that organizational perspectives on technology are frequently misaligned with the actual requirements and desires of the users of the technology. That is, the nature (or intention) of a technology may not always determine the nature of its use – the telephone, for example, was originally intended as a broadcast medium {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Its designers were focused on delivering content, while its users sought – and still value – connectivity(1).

The [[social media]] phenomenon presents emerging evidence that this quest for connectivity is rapidly becoming a core focus of communication technology within organizations. This potentially creates a disconnect with more traditional content-driven models of internal communication—delivering (or making easily available) the right content at the right time to the right people using the right media.

Therefore, there could be a great deal of potential within organisations, using their existing technologies, to derive cultural and performance benefits from re-thinking how they communicate, make decisions and work virtually.

'''Charles Eliot Norton''' (November 16, 1827 – October 21, 1908) was an [[United States|American]] author, social critic, and professor of art. He was a progressive social reformer and a liberal activist whom many of his contemporaries considered the most cultivated man in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{see also|Eliot family}}
Norton was born at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  His father, [[Andrews Norton]] (1786–1853), was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theologian, and Dexter professor of sacred literature at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]; his mother was Catherine Eliot, a daughter of the merchant [[Samuel Eliot (banker)|Samuel Eliot]]. [[Charles William Eliot]], president of Harvard, was his cousin. Norton graduated from Harvard in 1846, where he was a member of the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding]], and started in business with an East Indian trading firm in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], travelling to [[India]] in 1849. After a tour in [[Europe]], where he was influenced by John Ruskin and pre-Raphaelite painters, he returned to Boston in 1851, and devoted himself to literature and art. He translated [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''Vita Nuova'' (1860 and 1867) and the ''[[Divina Commedia]]'' (1891-91-92, 3 vols, 1902 being the publication year of Norton's thorough final edit). He worked tirelessly as secretary to the [[Loyal Publication Society]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], communicating with newspaper editors across the country, including the journalist [[Jonathan Baxter Harrison]] who became a lifelong friend.&lt;ref&gt;Turner (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; From 1864 to 1868, he edited the highly influential magazine ''[[North American Review]]'', in association with [[James Russell Lowell]]. In 1861 he and Lowell helped [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] in his translation of Dante and in the starting of the informal Dante Club.

==Marriage and family life==
In 1862 Norton married Susan Ridley Sedgwick (21 February 1838 – 17 February 1872), daughter of [[Theodore Sedgwick (writer)|Theodore Sedgwick III]] and Sara Morgan Ashburner.  They were the parents of six children: Eliot (1863), Sarah (1864), Elizabeth (1866), Rupert (1867), Margaret (1870) and Richard (1872).  Susan died at age thirty-three in Dresden, Germany, following the birth of their sixth child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sedgwick.org/na/library/books/sed1961/sed1961-214.html A Sedgwick Genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Turner (historian)|Turner, James]] 1999. "The Liberal Education of Charles Eliot Norton"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept of Western Civilization ==

"Probably only someone with Norton’s experiences and scholarly range – who had written about the Mound Builders, roamed India, organized classical archaeology, scoured medieval archives, published nineteenth-century painting – could have concocted Western Civilization. And only then if he had filtered these materials through the sieve of college teaching during years of curricular anarchy. For Western civilization had a scholarly and pedagogical specificity about it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travel and friendships ==
From 1855 to 1874 Norton spent much time in travel and residence on the continent of Europe and in England, and it was during this period that his friendships began with [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] and [[Leslie Stephen]], an intimacy which did much to bring American and English men of letters into close personal relation. Another friend was [[John Lockwood Kipling]], father of Rudyard Kipling. Father and son visited Norton in Boston and the younger Kipling recalled the visit years later in his autobiography:
{{quote|We visited at Boston [my father's] old friend, Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, whose daughters I had known at The Grange in my boyhood and since. They were Brahmins of the Boston Brahmins, living delightfully, but Norton himself, full of forebodings as to the future of his land’s soul, felt the established earth sliding under him, as horses feel coming earth-tremors. ... Norton spoke of Emerson and Wendell Holmes and Longfellow and the Alcotts and other influences of the past as we returned to his library, and he browsed aloud among his books; for he was a scholar among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Rudyard Kipling, ''Something of Myself: for my friends known and unknown'', London: MacMillan and Co., 1951 (first published 1937). pp. 127–28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Norton was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1860.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter N|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterN.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began teaching at Harvard in 1874.&lt;ref name=elfland1990&gt;{{cite book|author= Arthur Efland |title=History of Art Education: Intellectual and Social Currents in Teaching the Visual Arts |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3tyXoFOpPUC&amp;pg=PA64 |publisher= [[Teachers College Press]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8077-7003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, he was appointed professor of the history of art at Harvard, a chair which was created for him and which he held until retirement in 1898. He "centered his teaching upon the golden ages of art history -- classical Athens, the Italian Gothic style of Venetian architecture, and the Florence of the early Renaissance."&lt;ref name=elfland1990 /&gt;

The [[Archaeological Institute of America]] chose him as its first president (1879–1890).

Norton had a peculiar genius for friendship, and it is on his personal influence rather than on his literary productions that his claim to fame rests. In 1881 he inaugurated the Dante Society, whose first presidents were Longfellow, Lowell and Norton himself.  From 1882 onward he confined himself to the study of Dante, his professorial duties, and the editing and publication of the literary memorials of many of his friends.

In 1883 came the ''Letters of Carlyle and Emerson''; in 1886, 1887 and 1888, ''Carlyle's Letters and Reminiscences''; in 1894, the ''Orations and Addresses of [[George William Curtis]]'' and the ''Letters of Lowell''. Norton was also made Ruskin's [[literary executor]], and he wrote various introductions for the American "Brantwood" edition of Ruskin's works. His other publications include ''Notes of Travel and Study in Italy'' (1859), and an ''Historical Study of Church-building in the Middle Ages: Venice, Siena, Florence'' (1880). He organized exhibitions of the drawings of [[J.M.W. Turner|Turner]] (1874) and of Ruskin (1879), for which he compiled the catalogues. In 1886, he opposed the opening of a 'drinking saloon' on the main street near his home, in a letter which reveals little empathy for, or understanding of the significance of, Irish immigration to Cambridge in that era.&lt;ref&gt;For a copy of his letter, see [http://cambridgecivic.com/?p=2805 Cambridge Civic Journal Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Like his friend Ruskin, Norton believed one of the best things one could do for working-class people was to give them opportunities to gain satisfaction by engaging in [[workmanship]], as opposed to monotonous routine labor where they have to work like machines. [[T. J. Jackson Lears]] has described Norton as the foremost American proponent of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. Norton was a founding member of [[The Society of Arts and Crafts of Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Later years==
During the first years of the twentieth century, Norton spoke out in favor of legalized [[euthanasia]]. He lent his name to a movement led by Ohio socialite Anna S. Hall to pass [[physician-assisted suicide]] legislation in [[Ohio]] and [[Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob M. 2004. "A Duty to Kill? A Duty to Die? Rethinking the Euthanasia Controversy of 1906" in Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Volume 78, Number 3&lt;/ref&gt;
Norton died at "Shady Hill," the house where he had been born, on October 21, 1908, and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
Norton was widely admired for the breadth of his intellectual interests, remarkable scholarship and interest in the common good.  He was awarded the honorary degrees of Litt.D. (Cambridge) and D.C.L. (Oxford), as well as the L.H.D. from Columbia and the LL.D. from both Harvard and Yale. One of his many students at Harvard was [[James Loeb]], who in 1907 created the "Charles Eliot Norton Memorial Lectureship" in archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological.org/giving/endowments/244 The Charles Eliot Norton Memorial Lectureship, Archaeological Institute of America]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] are given annually by distinguished professors at Harvard. Norton bequeathed the more valuable portion of his library to Harvard.

''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]'' 10(3): 231-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Civic nationalism is frequently contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]].

[[Ernest Renan]] is often thought to be an early civic nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan. "[[What is a Nation?]]", 1882; cf. Chaim Gans, ''The Limits of Nationalism'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Civic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a "civic nation" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.&lt;ref name= definition&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|author=ANNA STILZ|title=Civic Nationalism and Language Policy|page=257|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another.&lt;ref name = definition/&gt; German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] argued that immigrants to a [[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] state need not assimilate into the host culture, but only need to accept the principles of the country's constitution (cf. [[Constitutional patriotism]]).&lt;ref name = definition/&gt;

==History==
{{or-section|date=January 2017}}
Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]], but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Membership of the civic [[nation]] is considered voluntary, as in [[Ernest Renan]]'s classical definition in "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]" of the nation as a "daily referendum" characterized by the "will to live together".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] (see the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, and the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789).

The Corsican nationalist movement organized around the [[FLNC]] is giving a civic definition of the Corsican nation ("destiny communauty") in the continuity of [[Pasquale Paoli]] and the ideas of the [[Lumières]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31950">'''Conjectural history''' is a type of [[historiography]] isolated in the 1790s by [[Dugald Stewart]], who termed it "theoretical or conjectural history", as prevalent in the historians and early social scientists of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology ''histoire raisonnée'', and the usage of "natural history" by [[David Hume]] in his work ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. It was related to "philosophical history", a broader-based kind of historical theorising, but concentrated on the early history of man in a type of [[rational reconstruction]] that had little contact with evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects : With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith': With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon MacIntyre|title=Dugald Stewart: The Pride and Ornament of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOFVh-i3Z04C&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-903900-34-5|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Palmeri|title=Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrp6ZZQmiYC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-829-0|pages=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such conjectural history was the antithesis of the [[narrative history]] being written at the time by [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. Stewart defended it as more universal in its application to [[humankind]], even at the cost of detailed documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet and Costa, p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not concerned with the political narrative and public life, but saw itself as an investigative "moral science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; General philosophical history was somewhat closer to narrative history than conjectural history could be, with its reliance in part on tenuous arguments on the nature of [[feudalism]] and early ethnographical reports from European travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stewart the ''Dissertation on the Origin of Languages'' by [[Adam Smith]] was an important example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=scottish-18th |title=Scottish Philosophy in the 18th Century |last=Broadie |first=Alexander|Thu Aug 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To justify the procedures of conjectural history, there needed to be an assumption of the uniformity of [[human nature]], or as Stewart put it, the "capacities of the human mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Alexander Broadie |title=The Scottish Enlightenment: An Anthology|year=1997 |publisher=Canongate Books |isbn=978-0-86241-738-3|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern context==
There was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in [[Early Modern Europe]], particularly on [[civil society]] in its components, [[civility]] and "society".

===Models and the "savage"===
{{main article|Noble savage}}
Hodgen comments, in a chapter ''From Hierarchy to History'', on the widespread use of "conjectural series" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The [[great chain of being]] was a static idea. "Stage series" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these conjectural series.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Modern natural history===
While the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, "natural history" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the [[Baconian natural history]], i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to [[natural philosophy]], which was theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G. N. Cantor|author3=J. R. R. Christie|author2=M. J. S. Hodge, R. C. Olby|title=Companion to the History of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&amp;pg=PT260|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97751-2|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Histoire raisonnée''===
The ''histoire raisonnée'' was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With [[Géraud de Cordemoy]] there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to [[Fortuna|Fortune]].&lt;ref&gt;Leffler, pp. 223–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadial history===
Contemporary terminology is '''stadial history''', or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see [[sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory]]).

Some basic conjectural history on [[human civilization]] was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the concept of the [[state of nature]], and with [[Count Buffon]] debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its [[anthropocentrism]] and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Wolloch|title=History and Nature in the Enlightenment: Praise of the Mastery of Nature in Eighteenth-Century Historical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWYe2DZbYskC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2115-3|pages=92–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]) as valid.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjectural histories of language and writing==
Adam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|page=80|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of [[Gabriel Girard (priest)|Gabriel Girard]]. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith: The Rhetoric of Propriety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_MODA0NVjQC&amp;pg=PA83|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8262-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase "conjectural history". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature [[Lucretius]]; it is now considered Smith was influenced by [[Montesquieu]] on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on [[political economy]]. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's [[history of astronomy]]; and the term can be seen as a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|pages=85–7|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Bigelow|title=Fiction, Famine, and the Rise of Economics in Victorian Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLIwbbcbuKcC&amp;pg=PA50|date=20 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44085-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of [[manners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2362-5|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warburton]] had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his ''[[Divine Legation of Moses]]'', a work supporting [[biblical authority]], around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in ''[[Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens]]''. Where writing moved from [[pictogram]]s to [[alphabet]]s, he saw language use as having moved analogously from [[gesture]]s to forms and figures of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra|title=How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-century Atlantic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzIGYxOC1oUC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4693-9|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four stages theory==
The term "conjectural history" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen O'Brien|title=Narratives of Enlightenment: Cosmopolitan History from Voltaire to Gibbon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9bOow5IFUwC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=5 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46533-5|pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an orthodox '''four stages theory''' of society, the stages being:

# [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]];
# [[pasturage]];
# [[agriculture]]; and 
# [[commerce]].

This ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or [[unilineal evolution]]. Some [[economic determinism]] applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Rosen|title=On Voluntary Servitude: False Consciousness and the Theory of Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBEWlGOhSMC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63779-5|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ter Ellingson|title=The Myth of the Noble Savage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqE3IhkeWToC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=17 December 2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92592-2|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] and [[Lord Kames]]; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6bhhU3iyhIC&amp;pg=PA225|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=6 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77924-1|page=225 note 18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France it was published at much the same time, also, by [[Claude Pierre Goujet]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], and [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"/&gt; Smith's "[[natural progress of opulence]]" is a closely related theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Noggle|title=The Temporality of Taste in Eighteenth-Century British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUT8187WaxkC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=9 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964243-4|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representative works==
Besides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included [[Adam Ferguson]], David Hume, Lord Kames, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Lord Monboddo]], writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Zachs |title=Without Regard to Good Manners: A biography of Gilbert Stuart (1743–1786) |year=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-0319-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porscha Fermanis|title=John Keats and the Ideas of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhfJN8IzDOgC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3780-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial. He included [[primate]]s and [[feral children]] as material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Broadie|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtda5SVxaF4C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00323-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson in his ''History of America'' moves between narrative and conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Ferguson, ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767)===
{{details|An Essay on the History of Civil Society}}
Ferguson in this work attempted a rigorous identification of the hunter stage with the so-called [[barbarian]] or savage, and was very alive to the whole scheme as full of tensions within human possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, pp. 330–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against the [[foundation story]] in the style of classical history, proposing instead that [[unintended consequences]] could have more to do with the "establishment" of a society than a self-conscious law-giver.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Millar, ''Observations concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society'' (1771)===
Millar argued in terms of a "system of manners" associated with each of the four stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Chandler|title=England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqWLrZ3UEvcC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=26 June 1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10109-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the advance of freedom, and denounced slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Avery Hunt|title=Measuring Time, Making History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=28 February 2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; As property became more complex, it followed that government did so also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=Enlightenment|year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-025028-2 |page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poovey states that this work makes apparent the relationship of conjectural history with the [[experimental moral philosophy]] of [[Thomas Reid]] and [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Poovey|title=A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf7ProAtFBkC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 December 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-67525-1|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Kames, ''Sketches of the History of Man'' (1774)===
Kames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of [[Montesquieu]], as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt; The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt; In writing to [[Basel]] in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from [[Isaak Iselin]], ''Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit'' (1764), which is also a conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&amp;pg=PA1140|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|page=1140 note 62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sketches'' was a collection of essays on social, cultural and political topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Sauer|title=Reading the Nation in English Literature: A Critical Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blEcG669IWIC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-44524-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author collected some ethnographic and miscellaneous information, assembling in particular a long chapter intended as a "history of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Alan Barnard|author2=Jonathan Spencer|title=Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1VpdrbH3BUC&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-45803-7|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Trentmann|title=Paradoxes of Civil Society: New Perspectives on Modern German and British History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ry0AybYtwEC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-143-1|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a second edition (Edinburgh, 1778) and a third (Dublin, 1779). Kames was an early [[polygenist]], or was an [[environmental monogenist]] only with scepticism about the adequacy of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John P. Jackson, Jr.|author2=Nadine M.

==Later developments==

===The tradition comes to an end===
Mainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as [[John Adams (writer)|John Adams]], [[William Alexander (physician)|William Alexander]] and [[John Logan (minister)|John Logan]] failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's ''History of Women'' (1779) being criticised as shallow.&lt;ref name="Broich"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Broich|title=Reactions to Revolutions: The 1790s and Their Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLvLPSwF-bIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7427-8|pages=232–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his ''Account'' of Adam Smith for the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects: With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith':|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and [[John Burrow]] has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism.&lt;ref name="Burrow1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Wyon Burrow|title=Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=1966|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-04393-9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where stadial theory appeared in later authors, the original thrust was distorted.&lt;ref name="Broich"/&gt; Hopfl has said that the heirs were [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne writes instead of the historical/sociological insights of the Scots being lost in the British context, despite the "tension between a 'natural' account of civil society and a developing sense of the factual importance and moral difficulties of individualism" having become apparent, to [[utilitarianism]] and vaguer [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Geoffrey Hawthorn |title=Enlightenment and Despair: A History of Social Theory |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-33721-6 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious opposition===
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Second Edition|second edition]] but particularly in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|third edition]] (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition [[James Tytler]] opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of [[George Gleig]], featured "Savage" as a new topic, and expanded articles "Society" and "Moral philosophy". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by [[David Doig]] who had answered Kames with ''Two Letters on the Savage State'' from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]] contributed to the article "Society", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing [[Lucretius]] and [[Democritus]], and godless materialist [[spontaneous generation]] of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aa.vv.|title=Storia della Storiografia.

===Relationship to antiquarianism===
Conjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British [[antiquarian]] circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]] and [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]], was favoured in the second half of the century.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;Sweet, pp. 20–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and [[civic humanism]]. The urban history of [[John Trussel]] was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the [[feudal system]] was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadial history was embraced by [[Thomas Pownall]].&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt;

===Conjectural history of peoples===
[[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing "hunting" into "gathering" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin S. Staum|title=Labeling People: French Scholars on Society, Race, and Empire, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJfz4ptLD0kC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=20 August 2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7124-2|pages=13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current "peoples" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and [[structural functionalism]] led to a rejection of the whole paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Ausenda|title=After Empire: Towards an Ethnology of Europe's Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqvhYaHrryEC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=1 February 2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85115-853-2|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cretan pederasty''' was an archaic form of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederasty]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ephorus|Ephorus of Cyme]] in [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'' 10.21.4&lt;/ref&gt; that involved the ritual kidnapping (''harpagmos'') of a noble boy by an adult male of the aristocratic class, with the consent of the boy's father.

The man (known as ''φιλήτωρ – philetor,'' "befriender") took the boy (known as ''kleinos,'' "glorious") into the wilderness, where they spent two months hunting and feasting with their friends. If the boy was satisfied with the conduct of his would-be comrade, he changed his title from ''kleinos'' to ''parastates'' (''κλεινός / παραστάτης'', "sidekick," indicating he had fought in battle alongside his lover)&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Kroll "Knabenliebe" in Pauly-Wissowa, ''Realencyclopaedie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft,'' vol. 11, cols. 897-906 [http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/kroll-pederasty.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; returned to the philetor and lived in close bonds of public intimacy with him.&lt;ref&gt;John Addington Symonds, ''A Problem in Greek Ethics,'' X p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of the institution, beside teaching the youth adult skills, was supposed to confirm the status of the best men, and to offer both lover and beloved the chance to give proof of a noble character deserving of respect.&lt;ref&gt;D. B. Dodd, '"Athenian Ideas about Cretan Pederasty," in T. Hubbard (ed.), ''Greek Love Reconsidered,'' New York, 2000; pp.33-41&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient Greek historical tracts trace the origins of the tradition to mythological times. [[Aristotle]] states that it was king [[Minos]] who established pederasty as a means of population control on the island community: ''[They] "segregated the women and instituted sexual relations among the males so that women would not have children."''&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics,'' II.10&lt;/ref&gt; The practice seems to have been reserved for the aristocracy, and it was a reciprocal acknowledgment and cultivation of honor. The man was honored by being allowed to take the boy, and the boy's honor was increased by being thus taken. As the historian [[Strabo]] records it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"(The Cretans) have a peculiar custom in regard to love affairs, for they win the objects with their love, not by persuasion, but by abduction; the lover tells the friends of the boy three or four days beforehand that he is going to make the abduction; but for the friends to conceal the boy, or not to let him go forth the appointed road, is indeed a most disgraceful thing, a confession, as it were, that the boy is unworthy to obtain such a lover; and when they meet, if the abductor is the boy’s equal or superior in rank or other respects, the friends pursue him and lay hold of him, though only in a very gentle way, thus satisfying the custom; and after that they cheerfully turn the boy over to him to lead away; if, however, the abductor is unworthy, they take the boy away from him."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent scholarship has suggested that the practice may have been adopted by the Dorians around 630 BC, spreading from Crete to [[Spartan pederasty|Sparta]] and then to the rest of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;William Armstrong Percy III, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," in ''Same–Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West,'' Binghamton, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
This custom was highly regarded, and it was considered shameful for a youth to not acquire a male lover. Again, Strabo:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It is disgraceful for those who are handsome in appearance or descendants of illustrious ancestors to fail to obtain lovers, the presumption being that their character (masculinity) is responsible for such a fate.  But the parastathentes (those who stand by their lover in battle) receive honors; for in both the dances and the races they have the positions of highest honor, and are allowed to dress in better clothes than the rest, that is, in the habit given them by their lovers; and not then only, but even after they have grown to manhood, they wear a distinctive dress, which is intended to make known the fact that each wearer has become kleinos, for they call the loved one kleinos (distinguished) and the lover philetor."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not surprisingly, these same Cretans were credited with introducing the myth of Zeus kidnapping Ganymede to be his lover in Olympus &amp;ndash; though even the king of the gods had to make amends to the father. This myth, however, is denounced by [[Plato]] in his ''Laws'' as having been made up to justify purely sensual practices: &lt;blockquote&gt;''And we are unanimous in accusing the Cretans of fabricating the story of Ganymede: because they believed that their laws had come from Zeus, they have also attached this story to the god, thinking that they could reap the fruit of this pleasure and say that they were following the god's example. But that is the realm of myth.'' (636B-D)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strabo also indicates that it is the boy’s [[masculinity]] that consigns him his lover: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The most desirable youths, according to Cretan conventions, are not the exceptionally handsome ones, but rather those who are distinguished for manly courage and orderly behavior.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;Together the boy and his lover live in the wilderness for a time, and at some point during the courtship the two made an offering of a [[ex voto|votive tablet]] and an animal sacrifice at the sanctuary of Hermes and Aphrodite, on [[Dikti|Mt. Dikte]], close to the cave where Zeus was said to have been reared.

Upon their return the lover gives the boy expensive gifts, among which a military outfit, an ox (a sacrifice to [[Zeus]]), and a drinking cup (symbolic of spiritual accomplishment). At that time, according to Strabo, the boy also is empowered to choose between continuing or putting an end to his relationship with his abductor, and to denounce the man if he misbehaved in any way. Here the cycle of honor given and returned is completed, but now it is the boy's turn to grant - or withhold - that honor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The youth sacrifices the ox to Zeus and gives a feast to those who came down with him from the mountains. He then declares, concerning his relationship with the lover, whether it took place with his consent or not; the convention encourages this in order that, if any violence is used against him in the abduction, he may restore his honor and break off the relationship.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A late comment by the Roman historian [[Cornelius Nepos]] claims that Cretan youths had more than one lover: "Quite young men in Crete are praised  for having had as many lovers as they could."&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Nepos, ''Preface,'' 3-5; trans. Thomas K. Hubbard&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological findings==

A number of archaeological findings have been interpreted as documentation of the Cretan pederastic rites. At a rustic shrine dedicated to Hermes and Aphrodite, at [[Kato Syme]], approximately sixty kilometers east of [[Hagia Triada]], excavations led by Angeliki Lembessi have uncovered numerous bronze objects and remains of animal sacrifices.

Among these were found bronze figures of youths from the Minoan period (before 1100 BC), indicating  this to have been a long-standing sanctuary site. Such figurines were offered over the course of many centuries. Little from Minoan and Mycenean times that survived the Dark Age (1200-800) after their fall could have influenced the Archaic Greeks (800-480). Minoans did have sensual art dominated by sexual symbols such as snakes and bulls, by the lithe bodies of wasp-waisted youths usually wearing loin-cloths, and by bare-breasted females. The terra cotta piece discovered near Phaistus showing four nude males with peaked caps dancing in a ring and the nude fisherman on a fresco from the Mycenean colony at Thera are exceptional, but not overtly pederastic. Certain later vases and terra cotta figurines also suggest some influence by sub-Mycenean on geometric art but none of the figural decorations that appeared on Mycenean or on Minoan vases or walls during the second millennium are clearly homoerotic. If those peoples institutionalized pederasty, their art does not indicate that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece|last = Percy|first = William A.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1996|isbn = 0252022092|location = Illinois|pages = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:Image:Cretan votive tablet - man and youth ritual.jpg|One set]], dated to c. 8th-7th century BC and presently in the [[Louvre]] depicts a male couple consisting of an older bearded male and a younger male with long, flowing hair and curls in front. The older partner, who carries a horn bow, grasps the younger by the arm and draws him close. The younger carries a slain goat on his shoulders, presumably a sacrificial animal. They are looking intently at each other, their legs and feet touch, and the genitals of the younger male are exposed.

Another bronze piece, dated c. 750 BC and presently in the [[Heraklion]] Museum, shows two helmeted but otherwise nude youths, one older than the other. They both display erections and stand beside each other holding hands. Yet another bronze cutout dated to the 7th century BC shows a lad, nude except for a long, decorative cape and sandals, holding a bow and quiver. These pieces document that this Cretan initiatory tradition continued over many centuries and that later offerings left by pairs of lovers at this shrine became more elaborate and erotically explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce L. Gerig, 2005, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths and folktales==
Beside the myths, a couple of Cretan pederastic folktales have come down to us, albeit in fragmentary form. In both tales the boy is named Leucocomas (leukos = bright / kóme = hair) and puts his lover to the test by challenging him to perform a number of difficult tasks, known as "athlon" (the same term used of the twelve [[Labors of Heracles]], "dodekathlos"). In the tale of Euxinthetus and Leucocomas the lover must bring the boy's dog from Prasus back to [[Gortyn]], a distance of one hundred eighty stadia (over twenty eight kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' X.4.12&lt;/ref&gt; In the other tale, that of [[Promachus]] ("forward fighter") and Leucocomas, the boy set his lover a number of arduous tasks, culminating in retrieving a priceless helmet. Promachos, however, infuriated by his beloved's endless and unreasonable demands, retrieved the helmet but placed it on the head of another boy, leading Leucocomas to kill himself in a jealous fit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]], ''Narrations'' 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Military Police Corps (United States)|United States Army Military Police Corps]] defines criminal intelligence in more detail; '''criminal intelligence''' is information gathered or collated, analyzed, recorded/reported and disseminated by law enforcement agencies concerning types of [[crime]], identified criminals and known or suspected criminal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm;jsessionid=2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ!99557122|title=Field Manual (FM) 3-19.50 - Police Intelligence Operations (2006)|work=rdl.train.army.mil|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720002859/https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm%3Bjsessionid%3D2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ%2199557122|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly useful when dealing with [[organized crime]]. Criminal intelligence is developed by using [[surveillance]], [[informant]]s, [[interrogation]], and [[research]], or may be just picked up on the "street" by individual [[police]] officers.

Some larger law enforcement agencies have a department, division or section specifically designed to gather disparate pieces of information and develop criminal intelligence. One of the most effective ways of applying criminal intelligence is first to record it (store in a [[computer]] system) which can be "mined" (searched) for specific information.

==US Army usage==
Criminal intelligence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CRIMINT is the result of the collection, analysis, and interpretation of all available information concerning known and potential [[criminal]] threats and vulnerabilities of supported organizations. Army law enforcement agencies are the primary liaison representatives of the Army to federal, state, local, and host nation (HN) agencies for exchanging police intelligence. They collect criminal intelligence (''CRIMINT'') and human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) within the provisions of applicable statutes and regulations. Army law enforcement agencies have the capability to analyze and disseminate collected time-sensitive information concerning a criminal threat against Army interests. The value of such intelligence cannot be overemphasized; it not only serves the purpose of police investigations, it also contributes to the development of countermeasures to safeguard Army personnel, materials, information, and other resources.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"&gt;FM 3-19.13 LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==CRIMINT Process==
The CRIMINT process is effective intelligence results from a series of interrelated activities. The intelligence process is a continuous process of collecting and converting data into [[intelligence]] products to be integrated into operations. The process consists of several phases with continuous evaluation and feedback at each phase and at the end of the process. With the minor modification of adding “reporting” to the second phase, the following text outlines the intelligence process as discussed in Army Regulation (AR) 525-13.

* CRIMINT planning and directing.
* CRIMINT collection and reporting.
* CRIMINT processing.
* Analysis and production.
* Dissemination and integration.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"/&gt;

== Criminal intelligence analysis ==
''Criminal intelligence analysis'' has been recognized by law enforcement as a useful support tool for over twenty-five years and is successfully used within the international community. International organizations, such as the International Police ([[INTERPOL]]), European Police ([[EUROPOL]]) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), and while there are many definitions of Criminal Intelligence Analysis in use throughout the world, the one definition agreed in June 1992 by an international group of twelve European INTERPOL member countries and subsequently adopted by other countries is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The identification of and provision of insight into the relationship between crime data and other potentially relevant data with a view to police and judicial practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071005230215/http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-10-05|title=International Police (INTERPOL) (2010)|work=interpol.int|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, criminal intelligence is a more intense or specific application towards investigations than [[criminology]].

== Criminal investigation analysis software ==
There are several techniques intended for criminal investigation analysis. One of them is [[link analysis]] which is dedicated to evaluate relationships between nodes. In this specific category there are several applications such as IBM i2 that provides integrated tools to support crime investigators and next-generation, single platforms as DataWalk that imports, integrates and links structured and unstructured data at massive scale for further visual analysis, investigation and collaboration.

'''Cultural schema theory''' holds that human beings employ classification to understand members of other cultures, and add new data to previously available categories.&lt;ref&gt;Shahghasemi, E. 2017. Cultural Schema Theory. The International Encyclopedia of Intercultural Communication. 1–9.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0019/full&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural schemas for [[social interaction]] are [[cognitive]] structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in a person's cultural environment. Schemas are generalized collections of knowledge of past experiences that are organized into related knowledge groups; they guide our behaviours in familiar situations. Cultural schemas do not differ from other schemas, except that they are shared by certain cultural groups rather than individuals (Garro, 2000). Schemas unique to individuals are created from personal experiences, whereas those shared by individuals are created from various types of common experiences (Garro, 2000). Cultural schema theory proposes that when we interact with members of the same [[culture]] in certain situations many times, or talk about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in our brain (Nishida, 1999).

== History ==
Cultural schema theory may be a relatively new theory, but neither schema nor cultural schema are new concepts.

The idea of schemas existing as ideal types in the mind dates back all the way back to [[Plato]] (see also [[Schema (disambiguation)|Schema]] and [[Schema (psychology)]]) . In the 19th century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] developed the idea that every person's experiences are gathered in memory, forming higher order concepts. In the 1920s [[Jean Piaget]]'s work investigated schemas in infants. In the 1930s [[Frederic Bartlett]] tested memory for schemas. From the 1970s to the 1990s, many researchers obtained loads of evidence showing that people's [[behaviors]] are deeply embedded to what they store in their brains. Through these studies researchers learned that [[human behavior]] relies heavily on past experiences and the [[knowledge]] stored in one's brain.

Research also revealed that schemas operate at many different levels. The experiences which are unique to individuals allow them to acquire personal schemas.  Societal schemas may emerge from a group's collective [[knowledge]] and are represented across the minds in a [[society]], enabling people to think as if they are one mind (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002). However, when one's cultural environment provides experiences to which every member of that culture is exposed, their experiences allow every member to acquire cultural schemas (Nishida, 1999). Cultural schemas are [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] structures which enable individuals to store perceptual and conceptual information about their [[culture]] and interpret cultural experiences and expressions. If people are not equipped with the appropriate cultural schema, they may not be able to make sense of culturally unfamiliar situations (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002).

== How cultural schemas develop ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

When one interacts with members of the same [[culture]] over and over again, or talks about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in one's brain. Subsequent similar instances cause the cultural schema to become more organized, abstract, and compact. As this occurs, communication becomes much easier. Nishida (1999) simply explains that experience is the force which creates cultural schemas. As people have more experiences their developing cultural schemas become more tightly organized. The information not only becomes more complex, but more useful among members of a culture, alike or different. Beyond the [[cognitive]] activity of cultural schemas is the complex pattern which occurs in the [[brain]].

When humans acquire and retain information from their surrounding environments, [[neural]] circuits are generated. Consequently, information processing experience is stored in the [[long-term memory]]. Memory representation or [[neural]] circuits created in the brain as a result of information processing are assumed to be schemas {{dubious|date=July 2013}}. Thus, schemas provide a foundation in the brain which helps to predict what is to be expected and looked for in certain situations.

Not all schemas are uniformly important. High-level schemas are internalized and emotionally salient; likewise, when a schema is only weakly related to a person's self it becomes emotionally empty and irrelevant (Lipset, 1993).

== Types of cultural schemas for social interactions ==

Cultural schemas for social interactions are cognitive structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in one's cultural environment. Nishida (1999) points out the eight primary types for generating human behavior for social interactions. These eight schemas are also referred to as Primary Social Interaction (PSI) schemas.

# ''Fact-and-concept schemas:'' These are pieces of general information about facts, such as Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States, and concepts, such as bicycles are vehicles that have two wheels, a seat, and pedals.
# ''Person schemas:'' These are knowledge about different types of people, specifically [[personality traits]]; for example, Barb is shy or Dave is outgoing. Since people have some representation or idea of what being shy or outgoing is, they tend to classify others, such as Barb and Dave, into their dominant personality traits.
# ''Self schemas:'' These contain people's knowledge of how they see themselves and knowledge of how others see them.
# ''Role schemas:'' These are knowledge about social roles that denote expected sets of behaviors of people in particular social positions.
# ''Context schemas:'' These contain information about the situations and appropriate settings of behavioral parameters. Information in context schemas includes predictions about appropriate actions to take in order to achieve goals in the respective context. Information also includes suggestions for reasonable problem-solving strategies. It is important to note that context schemas are triggered before other schemas {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.
# ''Procedure schemas:'' These are knowledge about the appropriate sequence of events in common situations. This includes the specific steps to take and the appropriate behavioral rules for the events. The use of procedure schemas causes people to take certain actions some way.
# ''Strategy schemas:'' These are knowledge about problem-solving strategies.
# ''Emotion schemas:'' These contain information about affect and evaluation stored in long-term [[memory]]. This is accessed when other schemas are activated. [[Emotion]] schemas develop through social interactions throughout a person's life. This schema is relatively new {{clarify|date=July 2013}}. Researchers believed it was an important additive because emotions play important roles in human social interactions.

== Application to cross-cultural adaptation ==
The term cross-cultural adaptation refers to the complex process through which an individual acquires an increasing level of the communication skills of the host culture and of relational development with host nationals. Simply put, cross-cultural adaptation is the transformation of a person's own PSI schemas into those of the host culture and acquisition of new PSI schemas in the host culture s/he is residing in. A number of different people may b e subject to cross-cultural adaptation, including [[immigrants]], [[refugees]], [[business people]], [[diplomats]], [[foreign workers]], and [[students]]. However, this entry specifically applies cultural schema theory to [[:wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]s' cross cultural adaptation. Sojourners generally spend a few years in another culture while intending to return to their home country. Business people, diplomats, students, and foreign workers can all be classified as sojourners. In order to better explain sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation, [[axioms]] are used to express causal, correlational, or [[teleological]] relationships. [[Axioms]] also help to explain the basic assumptions of the Cultural Schema Theory (Nishida, 1999).

=== Sojourners' axioms ===
Nishida (1999) describes the following nine axioms:

'''Axiom 1:''' The more often a person repeats a schema-based [[behavior]] in his or her culture, the more likely the cultural schema will be stored in the person's memory.

'''Axiom 2:''' Sojourners' failure to recognize the actions and behaviors that are relevant to meaningful interactions in the host culture are mainly due to their lack of the PSI schemas of the culture.

'''Axiom 3:''' The acquisition of the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation to the culture.

'''Axiom 4:''' The PSI schemas of a person's own culture are interrelated with each other, forming a network of cultural schemas to generate behaviors that are appropriate in the culture. Experience in the host culture causes a change in one's cultural schema. This causes further changes in all other cultural schemas and results in a total change in behavior.

'''Axiom 5:''' The acquisition of information about interrelationships among the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation.

'''Axiom 6:''' People use both schema-driven and data-driven processing to perceive new information, depending on the situation and their motivations.

'''Axiom 7:''' If one has well-organized cultural schemas, schematically salient information is more likely to be processed through the schemas, whereas ambiguous information will either direct a search for the relevant data to complete the stimulus more fully, or it will be filled in with default options of the schemas.

'''Axiom 8:''' Sojourners who lack the PSI schemas of the host culture are more likely to employ data-driven processing, which requires effort and attention.

'''Axiom 9:''' In the host culture, sojourners encounter truly novel situations where they experience [[cognitive]] [[uncertainty]] and [[anxiety]] because of the lack of the PSI schemas in the situations.

'''Axiom 10:''' In the host culture, sojourners experience the stages of self-regulation and self-direction. In the stage of self-regulation, they try to resolve ambiguities and to establish integration of information using their native-culture schemas by gradually modifying them. In the stage of self-direction, on the other hand, they actively try to reorganize their native [[culture]] schemas or to generate host culture schemas in order to adapt to the host-culture environment.

=== Real-world example – a sojourner's experience ===
As discussed above, [[:wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]s are people who live in a culture other than their own with the intent of one day returning home. For sojourner Gillian Gibbons' situation, the cultural schema theory is highly applicable. Ms. Gibbons, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[school teacher]], left [[Liverpool, England]] in August 2007 to teach a group of six- and seven-year-olds at Unity School in [[Khartoum, Sudan]]. Shortly after her arrival, Ms. Gibbons class was due to study the habitat and behavior of bears. Upon her request, a student brought in a [[teddy bear]] to serve as a case study. Students were invited to vote on a name for the bear. After considering the names [[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]] and [[Hassan (name)|Hassan]], 20 of the 23 children voted in favor of the name [[Muhammad]]. What seemed like a harmless children's learning tool took a turn for the worse on November 25, 2007, when Ms. Gibbons was arrested at her home inside the school premises; Sudanese police claimed a number of parents complained to Sudan's [[Ministry of Education (Sudan)|Ministry of Education]] about the bear. Charges against Ms. Gibbons were prepared under article 125 of Sudanese [[criminal law]] which covers insults against faith and religions.  Ms Gibbons' particular crime: insulting Islam's [[Prophet Muhammad]]. In [[Islam]], insulting the [[Prophet Muhammad]] is considered a grave offense.  Ms. Gibbons' was held in a [[Khartoum]] jail facing a maximum penalty of 40 lashes and 6 months in jail. Ms. Gibbons was found guilty of insulting Islam and sentenced to 15 days in jail and deportation from Sudan after her release. Sudanese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] granted her a pardon after she served nine days in jail due to pressure from the British government. She immediately returned to [[England]] upon her release. While colleagues, friends, and family regarded the whole situation as a misunderstanding, many local Sudanese disagreed. Hundreds of protestors gathered outside of the presidential palace to denounce Ms. Gibbons. Some protestors waved ceremonial swords, some voiced anger at the Sudanese government for not treating her more severely, some distributed leaflets which condemned her as an infidel and accused her of polluting children's mentality by her actions. At the edge of extreme were those who called for her execution (BBC News, 2007; CNN, 2007; New York Times, 2007; TIME, 2007; Times Online, 2007). This highly publicized incident can be explained quite well by the cultural schema theory, particularly by discussing Ms. Gibbons' status as a sojourner in an unfamiliar culture. Axiom number three and axiom number nine apply quite well to Ms. Gibbons. As a sojourner, the acquisition of host [[culture]] PSI schemas would be necessary in order for the sojourner's cross-cultural adaptation to occur. Ms. Gibbons may have lived in Sudan, but she lived inside the walls of Unity School. According to [[BBC News]] (2007), once inside the walls of Unity School one would think s/he was at standing on the grounds of an Oxbridge University. This private school with children of well-to-do parents is much different than the rest of Sudan. Ms. Gibbons did not need to acquire the PSI schemas of the host culture because her native PSI schemas worked equally well inside the walls of Unity School. Had Ms. Gibbons been constantly made aware of the local PSI schemas (naming an animal after the [[Prophet Muhammad]] is unacceptable) she may have adapted and not allowed the children to name the teddy bear Muhammad. Naming a teddy bear was not a novel situation to her as a children's school teacher, but she was not in England. After the bear's naming she certainly encountered a novel situation where she experienced cognitive uncertainty and anxiety because of her lack of the PSI schemas in the situation. Hence the difficulties of cross-cultural adaptation for sojourners like Ms. Gibbons. They do not intend to stay and thus will not adapt/experience the stages of axioms which will best prepare them to appropriately fit in.

== Contrasting theory ==
Cultural Schema Theory is often compared and contrasted with the [[Cultural consensus theory|Cultural Consensus Theory]]. Both theories present distinct perspectives about the nature of individual and cultural knowledge. However, unlike the Cultural Schema Theory, the Cultural Consensus Theory helps to describe and mathematically measure the extent to which cultural beliefs are shared. The central idea is the use of the pattern of agreement or consensus among members of the same culture.  Essentially, the more knowledge people have, the more consensus is observed among them. Unfortunately, the Cultural Consensus Theory does not help others to better understand [[intracultural]] variability or how cultural knowledge is interrelated at a cognitive level. Cultural Consensus Theory anticipates intracultural variation but views variation as analogous to performance on a cultural test, with certain individuals functioning as better guides than others to the cultural information pool (Garro, 2000).

== Further use and development of the theory ==
Simply put, cultural schema theory can be described as cultural-specific world knowledge (Razi, 2002). As mentioned above, the concept of Cultural Schemas is not new, but the theory is.  Future studies must generate theorems and further tests must be conducted in order to better formulate theory itself and the axioms it proposes. Once this is complete the theory can be used in cross-cultural training purposes in order to facilitate individuals' adaptation to their respective host-culture environments (Nishida, 1999). There has been efforts to make this task done. For example, Ehsan Shahghasemi and [[D. Ray Heisey]] (2009) introduce the notion of "cross cultual schemata" as "abstract mental structures that one makes according to his/her past experiences or shared knowledge about the members of other cultures and thus makes them more understandable."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2009v18n1/10%20Ehsan%20Shaghasemi%20&amp;%20D.%20Ray%20Heisey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''cycle of violence''' refers to repeated and dangerous acts of [[violence]]  as a cyclical pattern,&lt;ref name=HELP&gt;[http://helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm#cycle ''The cycle of violence.''] Domestic Violence and Abuse,

Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  associated with high emotions and doctrines of [[Retributive justice|retribution]] or [[revenge]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  The pattern, or cycle, repeats and can happen many times during a relationship.&lt;ref name=HELP/&gt; Each phase may last a different length of time, and over time the level of violence may increase.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The phrase has been increasingly widespread since first popularised in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Google Ngram search&lt;/ref&gt;

It often refers to violent behavior learned as a child, and then repeated as an adult, therefore continuing on in a perceived cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, A. A. (2005). The Relationship Between Adolescent Physical Abuse and Criminal Offending: Support for an Enduring and Generalized Cycle of Violence. ''Journal of Family Violence.'' 20(5):279-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within a relationship==

A cycle of abuse generally follows the following pattern:&lt;ref name=HELP/&gt; 
* [[Abuse]] &amp;ndash; The abuser initiates aggressive, [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]], designed to [[Abusive power and control|control]] and oppress the victim.
* [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]] &amp;ndash; The abuser feels guilty for inflicting abusive behavior, primarily out of a concern of being found guilty of abuse rather than feelings of sympathy for the victim.
* [[Rationalization (making excuses)|Excuses &amp;ndash; Rationalization]] of the behavior, including [[blame]] and excuses.
* "Normal" behavior &amp;ndash; The abuser regains personal control, creates a peaceful phase in an attempt to make the victim feel in the relationship.
* [[Fantasy (psychology)|Fantasy]] and planning &amp;ndash; thinking of what the victim has done wrong, how they will be punished, and developing a plan to realize the fantasy.
* Set-up &amp;ndash; the plan is "put in motion."

A cyclical nature of domestic violence is most prevalent in intimate terrorism (IT), which involve a pattern of ongoing [[Abusive power and control|control]] using emotional, physical and other forms of domestic violence and is what generally leads victims, who are most often women, to [[women's shelter]]s.  It is what was traditionally the definition of domestic violence and is generally illustrated with the "Power and Control Wheel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf ''Power and Control Wheel,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027084459/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf |date=2011-10-27 }} National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate the different and inter-related forms of abuse.

==Intergenerational==
[[Intergenerational]] cycles of violence occur when violence is passed from parent to child, or sibling to sibling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abusivelove.com/abuse_types_1_11.htm Intergenerational Cycle Of Abuse] AbusiveLove.com. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children exposed to domestic violence are likely to develop [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] problems, such as [[Regression (psychology)|regressing]], exhibiting out of control behavior,&lt;ref name=acadv&gt;[http://www.acadv.org/children.html ''The Effects of Domestic Violence on Children.''] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021103134717/http://www.acadv.org/children.html |date=2002-11-03 }} Alabama Coalition Against Domestic Violence.&lt;/ref&gt;  and imitating behaviors.

An estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of teenagers subject to viewing domestic violence situations experience [[teen dating violence]], regularly abusing or being abused by their partners verbally, mentally, emotionally, sexually and/or physically. Thirty to 50% of dating relationships can exhibit the same cycle of escalating violence in their marital relationships.&lt;ref name=SASS&gt;[http://www.sassnh.org/ ''Sexual Assault Survivor Services''] (SASS) Facts about domestic violence. (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physical punishment]] of children has also been linked to later [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page=16 |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms "the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later assaults on spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray A. (2000). [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf "Corporal punishment by parents: The cradle of violence in the family and society" (PDF).] ''Virginia Journal of Social Policy and the Law''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==

Arab philosopher [[Ibn Khaldun]] in 1377 identified a cycle of violence in which successive [[dynasties]] take control of a state and establish [[asabiyyah]] or social cohesion, enabling them to expand to the limit. Excess 'pomp' causes the dynasty then to stagnate, become sedentary and collapse, giving way to conquest by a new, more ruthless dynasty. This cycle plays out over the course of three generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[The Muqadimmah]]'', Routledge, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John J. Mearsheimer]] the cycle of violence between nations will continue indefinitely because the [[Great powers]] fear each other, thus compete for power and dominance, in the belief that this will ensure safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[John J. Mearsheimer]], ''[[The Tragedy of Great Power Politics]]'', WW Norton, 2003, Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

'Cycle of violence' is also used more generally to describe any long-term factional dispute within a nation in which [[tit-for-tat]] acts of aggression occur frequently, as for example in  [[Argentina]] in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ervin Staub]],
''The Roots of Evil'', Cambridge UP, 1989, p281&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Miller, ''From Lebanon to Intifada'', University Press of America, 1991, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital addict''' is used to refer to a person who compulsively uses [[digital technology]], which would manifest as another form of [[addiction]] if that technology was not as easily accessible to them. Colloquially, it can be used to describe a person whose interaction with technology is verging on excessive, threatening to absorb their attention above all else and consequently having a negative impact on the well-being of the user.

The primary theory is digital technology users develop digital addiction by their habitual use and reward from computer applications.  This reward triggers the reward center in the brain that releases more dopamine, opiates, and neurochemicals, which over time can produce a stimulation tolerance or need to increase stimulation to achieve a “high” and prevent withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Hilarie|last2=Rae|first2=Cosette D|last3=Steel|first3=Ann H|last4=Winkler|first4=Alexander|date=2017-02-28|title=Internet Addiction: A Brief Summary of Research and Practice|journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews|volume=8|issue=4|pages=292–298|doi=10.2174/157340012803520513|issn=1573-4005|pmc=3480687|pmid=23125561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used as a conversational phrase, digital addict describes an increasingly common dependence on devices in the [[digital age]].

==Discourse==
Founded in current research on the adverse consequences of overusing technology,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecswe.com/downloads/publications/QOC-V3/Chapter-4.pdf. Aric Sigman.

The Impact of Technology on the Developing Child. The Huffington Post. 29 May 2013. Accessed: 06 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; digital addict is used as an overarching phrase to suggest an increasing trend of compulsive behaviour amongst users of technological devices, recognising that over-exposure to and over-use of technology can result in a dependence on digital devices, leading to behavioural symptoms similar to any addictive disorder, as the user neglects to maintain a healthy balance between using technology and socialising outside of it. 
 
The negative side-effects of overusing technology have in recent decades attracted increasing attention as a legitimate psychological disorder.  Unrestrained use of technological devices may impact upon developmental, social, mental and physical well-being and result in symptoms akin to other [[behavioural addiction]]. Several clinics worldwide now offer treatment for [[internet addiction disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10425194/Child-internet-addicts-sent-to-4500-a-week-addiction-clinics.html.

Accessed: 24 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  demonstrating the addictive qualities of technology as warranting further medical and academic research.

It is clear that, whilst still debated, the potential for internet or digital devices to have addictive qualities is an emerging concern.  In recent years particular attention has been paid to how the over-use of technology may be affecting the younger generation.  With an influx of technology designed for day-to-day use, many children are becoming increasingly reliant upon digital devices for education, social networking and entertainment.  With young people spending less time interacting with their peers face to face and more time indoors than previous generations, the direct impact of digital devices on both physical and mental well-being is becoming of concern.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, L. R., Green, G. T., &amp; Cordell, H. K. (2011). Children's Time Outdoors: Results and Implications of the National Kids Survey. Journal of Park &amp; Recreation Administration, 29(2), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The potential developmental side-effects of internet use are also recognised by the American Academy of Paediatrics in children under two years of age.&lt;ref&gt;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/10/12/peds.2011-1753.full.pdf+html.  Council of Communications and Media.  Media Use by Children younger than two years.  Paediatrics: The Official Journal of the American Academy of Paediatrics. 17 October 2011.  Accessed: 24 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, South Korea's concern for the attachment its younger generation has to technology is even greater, with their parliament considering passing a law to curb obsessive game use within the country by classifying online gaming as a potentially anti-social addiction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/south-korea-considers-law-to-classify-online-gaming-as-a-potentially-antisocial-addiction-8998538.html.  Heather Saul.  South Korea considers law to classify online gaming as a potentially antisocial addiction.’ 11 December 2013.  Accessed: 23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether by academics, medics, journalists or users themselves, concerns are voiced worldwide about the potentially addictive qualities of technology, building a legitimate case for considering digital addict a valid social descriptor, aptly describing a collective trend in media habits.  Although the extent to which digital addiction can be considered of medical interest continues to be discussed, the recognition of technology overuse as a developing cultural and social issue remains important.

== Origins  ==

The phrase has been used informally amongst some internet users and bloggers, one of the earliest uses being in 2009 in an article by Rupinder Gill on the popular blog SparkLife.&lt;ref&gt;Rupinder Gill. [http://community.sparknotes.com/2009/08/10/signs-u-r-a-digital-addict Signs u r a Digital Addict]. SparkLife Blog. Aug 2009. Accessed: 11 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was then independently adopted and promoted by Stephen Dilworth MD Member Network UK for Foresters, the international financial services organisation. Foresters defined, developed and applied the term digital addict to substantiate use of the phrase within discussion on the potential danger in being over-exposed to technology. The term has been used in several published resources, first appearing in its commercial use between October – December 2013.

The phrase has been used significantly, and persuasively, as part of the Tech Timeout campaign&lt;ref&gt;http://techtimeout.com/&lt;/ref&gt; an international initiative encouraging families to consider how reliant they are upon the devices within their home by taking an hour out of their day to spend away from technology and instead spend that time as a family. The Tech Timeout campaign was devised to negotiate the growing issue of technology addiction and addresses the importance of moderating our use of digital technologies so as not to become dependent upon them. Digital addict is used within this context to hint at the growing obsession with digital devices, and although an informal descriptor, it is used from a position of concern for the growing dependence upon technology in wider society and within the home.

Born of the recognition that the acceptance of technology in the modern world has hidden the extent to which populations are becoming reliant upon, and over-attached to, digital devices 'digital addict' offers a collective term to recognise the increasing amount of time dedicated to using internet or digital devices in contemporary society.

The digital divide has led to the development of many phrases seeking to define trends in behavioural use of technology and patterns of behaviour, ranging from digital native to [[digital detox]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/digital-detox?q=digital+detoxes.  Oxford Dictionaries Online.  Accessed: 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; to [[digital omnivore]], all recognising the prevalence of technology in our lives.  Digital addict fits within this discourse and begins to consider the psychological effects of internet use and the impact this has upon mental, social and even physical well-being.

== Children using digital devices ==
Studies have shown that children’s technology use has greatly increased over the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cris-rowan/technology-children-negative-impact_b_3343245.html|title = The Impact of Technology on the Developing Child|date = 2013-05-29|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Subrahmanyam, Kaveri, et al. "The Impact of Home Computer use on Children's Activities and Development." ''The Future of Children'' 10.2 (2000): 123-44. ''ProQuest.'' Web. 21 Apr. 2016.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, children as young as one year of age are using technology, such as tablets, iPhones, and computers. Although these devices can be a good learning tool as it teaches children how to use these technologies, it can also harm them in various ways. Researchers have found that the use of these devices can cause or contribute to child obesity because children spend so much time on their devices. It is also common for these children suffer pain because they are looking at their screens for long period of time. Moreover, children in the future may experience having poorer muscle tone because of being hunched over while using the devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Don't put your kids at risk: Experts warn of dangers with children using technology|url = http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/554497/Toddlers-risk-dangers-technology|accessdate = 2015-06-17|first = Charlotte|last = Wace}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With increased time spent in front of the screen, children spend less time playing sports, exercising or participating in other activities, such as reading or engaging with other children. This is not only having a physical effect, but it also is affecting the children’s social development. Face-to-face interactions are highly crucial in a child’s development so that they can learn social and communication skills but increased technology time limits this and can impede learning. The time spent on screen can make young children suffer by affecting their learning abilities in a detrimental way. Children can learn and retain information better in person than from a screen between the ages of 12–18 months. A specific term called "video deficit" occurs when an infant learns better from a live presentation than from a video presentation. There has been multiple studies that showed children between the ages of 12–36 months who learn how to imitate and solve problems more adequately when they observe an in person demonstration versus when watching it from a video screen.&lt;ref&gt;http://ebookcentral.proquest.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/lib/umcp/reader.action?docID=4709397{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the technological age that children are growing up in, this is becoming an increasing problem due to its accessibility to children but taking away digital devices would also have a detrimental effect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ching-Ting, Hsin, Li Ming-Chaun, and Tsai Chin-Chung.

Although there are many significant sources claiming that the negatives outweigh the positives in children’s technology use, it should also be noted that effects of prosocial video game play have been correlated with a child’s ability to feel empathy making them more inclined to help others according to Greitmeyer &amp; Osswald in a 2010 study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/14PAGBS.pdf ''IA State Public Psychology'', The Positive and Negative Effects of Video Game Play, Retrieved February 21, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of technology by children can also contribute to the overall improvements of motor skills. By playing interactive games and knowing how to navigate through a screen using buttons, children are able to learn how to coordinate their brains with their fingers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthresearchfunding.org/11-pros-and-cons-of-children-using-technology/ "11 Pros and Cons of Children Using Technology" - HRFnd".

The '''easiness effect''' is the claim that as a result of [[popular science|science popularization]] [[layperson|laypeople]] develop an overconfident scientific understanding. This results in science-related decision-making that reflects a misunderstanding of popular science rather than the judgment of professional scientists.{{R|"Scharrer"}}

== Context ==
Rainer Bromme and Susan Goldman, writing in the ''[[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]]'' describe the context, stating "Challenges to understanding science include determining the relevance of information, the tentativeness of scientific truth, distinguishing between scientific and nonscientific issues, and determining what is true and what is false."{{R|"Bromme"}}

Scotty Hendricks, a contributing writer to BigThink.com, notes that popular science writers might have to start considering the effect that their work has on the general public.{{R|"Hendricks2016"}}

== Evidence ==
Scharrer and her co-authors studied the claimed effect by inviting laypeople to read popular science articles and/or articles with more scientific detail, publishing their results in ''[[Public Understanding of Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Scharrer" /&gt; The subjects were then interviewed to judge their scientific opinions and confidence in those opinions, in relation to the material that they had read. Scharrer's team inferred that there was a statistically significant effect of scientific overconfidence and willingness to override expert opinion.{{R|"Scharrer"}}

In some of their experiments, Scharrer's team attempted to counteract the easiness effect by explicitly warning subjects of the complexity and controversiality of the scientific material presented. They found that the easiness effect disappeared partially but not completely.{{R|"Scharrer"}} The researchers suggest that it has to do mostly with writing style. Popular articles condense the science and speak with certainty whereas an academic paper speaks mostly in terms of probability. Hence reading mostly popularizations leads to overconfidence in the results.{{R|"Hendricks2016"}}

== Countermeasures ==
Scharrer and her co-authors recommended "explicitly highlighting topic complexity and controversiality" in order to reduce the easiness effect, and additionally
recommended "a need for further educating the public on the division of cognitive labor and its implications for making judgments" and adding to formal science education the notion that "making reliable judgments often requires deference to scientific experts".{{R|"Scharrer"}}
== Commentary ==
Mark Carnall of [[The Guardian]] said that the expanded access that laypeople have to simplified explanations of scientific facts may be the cause of their rising distrust in experts. The partial understanding they get from the "easy-to-digest science stories" from the media and bad [[science communication]] would give them confidence to reject the actual claims that scientists make.  He expresses the concern that "[[alternative facts]]" exploit this effect to confuse what scientific facts really are and highlights the importance of critical thinking skills to counter this phenomenon.{{R|"Guardian_Carnall"}}

'''Elizabeth Fry''' (née '''Gurney''', often referred to as ''Betsy''; 21 May 1780 – 12 October 1845) was an [[England|English]] [[prison reform]]er, [[social reform]]er and, as a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]], a [[Christian]] [[philanthropist]]. She has sometimes been referred to as the "angel of prisons".

Fry was a major driving force behind new legislation to make the treatment of prisoners more humane, and she was supported in her efforts by [[Queen Victoria]]. She was depicted on the [[Bank of England £5 note]] from 2001–2016. Fry kept extensive and revealing diaries.

==Birth and family background==
Elizabeth Fry was born in Gurney Court, off Magdalen Street, [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk, England|Norfolk]], England into a prominent [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] family, the [[Gurney family (Norwich)|Gurneys]]. Her childhood family home was [[Earlham Hall]], which is now part of the [[University of East Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.uea.ac.uk/cm/home/schools/ssf/law/EHall Earlham Hall, UEA]&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[John Gurney (1749–1809)]], was a partner in [[Gurney's Bank]]. Her mother, Catherine, was a member of the Barclay family who were among the founders of [[Barclays Bank]]. Her mother died when Elizabeth was twelve years old. As one of the oldest girls in the family, Elizabeth was partly responsible for the care and education of the younger children, including her brother [[Joseph John Gurney]], a philanthropist. One of her sisters was [[Louisa Gurney Hoare]] (1784–1836), a writer on education.

==Awakening of social concern==
[[File:Elizabeth Fry - Project Gutenberg etext 13103.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Fry]]
According to her diary Elizabeth was moved by the preaching of [[Priscilla Buxton|Priscilla Hannah Gurney]], Deborah Darby and [[William Savery]]. Unlike her direct family she recognised the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Francisca de Haan, ‘Fry , Elizabeth (1780–1845)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10208, accessed 18 Sept 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
She met [[Joseph Fry (tea merchant)|Joseph Fry]] (1777–1861), a banker and part of the Fry's chocolate-making family, who was also a Quaker, when she was 20 years old. They married on 19 August 1800 at the Norwich Goat Lane Friends Meeting House and moved to St Mildred's Court in the [[City of London]]. Elizabeth Fry was recorded as a [[Recorded Minister|minister]] of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] in 1811.

Joseph and Elizabeth Fry lived in Plashet House in [[East Ham]] between 1809 and 1829, then moved to The Cedars on Portway in [[Forest Gate]], where they lived until 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Stratford, West Ham &amp; The Royal Docks| last=Pewsey| first=Stephen| year=1996| publisher=Sutton Publishing| isbn=0-7509-1417-3| page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = WEST HAM PARK, Newham - 1001685 | publisher = Historic England | accessdate = 22 March 2018 | url = https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1001685}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had eleven children, five sons and six daughters:

==Prison work==
[[File:Mrs. Fry reading to the prisoners in Newgate John Johnson.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fry reading to inmates in Newgate prison]]
Prompted by a family friend, [[Stephen Grellet]], Fry visited [[Newgate Prison]] in 1813. The conditions she saw there horrified her.&lt;ref name=quakers&gt;[http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/13/Elizabeth-Fry "Elizabeth Fry", Quakers in the World]&lt;/ref&gt; The women's section was overcrowded with women and children, some of whom had not even received a trial. The prisoners did their own cooking and washing in the small cells in which they slept on straw.

She returned the following day with food and clothes for some prisoners. She was unable to personally further her work for nearly four years because of difficulties within the Fry family, including financial difficulties in the Fry bank{{clarify|date=June 2016}}. 
Fry returned in 1816 and was eventually able to fund a prison school for the children who were imprisoned with their mothers. Rather than attempt to impose discipline on the women, she suggested rules and then asked the prisoners to vote on them. In 1817 she helped found the ''Association for the Reformation of the Female Prisoners in Newgate''. This association provided materials for women so that they could learn to sew and knit and once they were out of prison and then could earn money for themselves.&lt;ref name=howard&gt;[http://www.howardleague.org/elizabethfry/ "Elizabeth Fry", The Howard League for Penal Reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327215033/http://www.howardleague.org/elizabethfry/ |date=27 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the eventual creation of the ''British Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners'' in 1821.&lt;ref name=lyd/&gt; She also promoted the idea of rehabilitation instead of harsh punishment which was taken on by the city authorities in London as well as many other authorities and prisons.

In 1827, Fry visited women prisoners in Ireland (see ''Memoirs of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry'', Thomas Timpson, NY: Stanford &amp; Swords, 1847, pp. 82-99).

Elizabeth Fry also campaigned for the rights and welfare of prisoners who were being [[Penal transportation to Australia|transported]]. The women of Newgate Prison were taken through the streets of London in open carts, often in chains, huddled together with their few possessions. They were pelted with rotten food and filth by the people of the city. The fear was often enough to make women condemned to transportation riot on the evening before. Fry's first action was to persuade the Governor of Newgate prison to send the women in closed carriages and spare them this last indignity before transportation. She visited prison ships and persuaded captains to implement systems to ensure each woman and child would at least get a share of food and water on the long journey. Later she arranged each woman to be given scraps of material and sewing tools so that they could use the long journey to make quilts and have something to sell as well as useful skills when they reached their destination. She also included a bible and useful items such as string and knives and forks in this vital care package.
Elizabeth Fry visited 106 transport ships and saw 12,000 convicts. Her work helped to start a movement for the abolition of transportation. Transportation was officially abolished in 1837, however Elizabeth Fry was still visiting transportation ships until 1843.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Elizabeth Fry: Britain's Second Lady on the Five-Pound Note, Dennis Bardens, {{ISBN|0954197356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Fry wrote in her book ''Prisons in Scotland and the North of England'' that she stayed the night in some of the prisons and invited nobility to come and stay and see for themselves the conditions prisoners lived in. Her kindness helped her gain the friendship of the prisoners and they began to try to improve their conditions for themselves. [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]], Fry's brother-in-law, was elected to Parliament for [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and began to promote her work among his fellow MPs. In 1818 Fry gave evidence to a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] committee on the conditions prevalent in British prisons, becoming the first woman to present evidence in Parliament.

==Humanitarian work==
Elizabeth Fry also helped the [[homeless]], establishing a "nightly shelter" in [[London]] after seeing the body of a young boy in the winter of 1819/1820. In 1824, during a visit to [[Brighton]], she instituted the Brighton District Visiting Society.&lt;ref name=quakers/&gt; The society arranged for volunteers to visit the homes of the poor and provide help and comfort to them. The plan was successful and was duplicated in other districts and towns across Britain.

Elizabeth Fry used her influential network and worked with other prominent Quakers to campaign for the abolition of the slave trade.

After her husband went bankrupt in 1828, Fry's brother became her business manager and benefactor. Thanks to him, her work went on and expanded.

In 1838 the Friends sent a party to France. Fry and her husband, [[Lydia Irving]], and abolitionists [[Josiah Forster]] and [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]]. They were there on other business but despite the language barrier Fry and Lydia Irving visited French prisons.&lt;ref name=lyd&gt;Amanda Phillips, ‘Irving, Lydia (1797–1893)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58591, accessed 20 June 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840 Fry opened a training school for nurses. Her programme inspired [[Florence Nightingale]], who took a team of Fry's nurses to assist wounded soldiers in the [[Crimean War]].

In 1842, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] went to see Fry in [[Newgate Prison]] during an official visit to Great Britain. The [[King of Prussia]], who had met the social reformer during her previous tours of the continent promoting welfare change and humanitarianism, was so impressed by her work that he told his reluctant courtiers that he would personally visit the gaol when he was in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kelly|last=Grovier|title=The Gaol|publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]|page=278|ISBN=978-0-7195-6133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
One admirer was [[Queen Victoria]], who granted her an audience a few times before she was Queen and contributed money to her cause after she ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Another admirer was [[Robert Peel]] who passed several acts to further her cause including the Gaols Act 1823. The act was largely ineffective, because there were no inspectors to make sure that it was being followed.

Following her death in 1845, a meeting chaired by the Lord Mayor of London, resolved that it would be fitting "to found an [[Poorhouse|asylum]] to perpetuate the memory of Mrs Fry and further the benevolent objects to which her life had been devoted."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A fine 18th-century town house was purchased at 195 Mare Street, in the London Borough of Hackney and the first Elizabeth Fry refuge opened its doors in 1849. Funding came via subscriptions from various city companies and private individuals, supplemented by income from the inmates' laundry and needlework. Such training was an important part of the refuge's work. In 1924, the refuge merged with the Manor House Refuge for the Destitute, in Dalston in Hackney, becoming a hostel for girls on probation for minor offences {{Citation needed|reason=no source cited on whether any crimes were "minor"|date=August 2016}}. The hostel soon moved to larger premises in Highbury, Islington and then, in 1958, to Reading, where it remains today. The original building in Hackney became the CIU New Lansdowne Club but became vacant in 2000 and has fallen into disrepair. [[Hackney Council]], in 2009, was leading efforts to restore the building and bring it back into use. The building did undergo substantial refurbishment work in 2012 but as of July 2013, the entire building is for sale. The building and Elizabeth Fry are commemorated by a plaque at the entrance gateway.

==Death==
Fry died from a [[stroke]] in Ramsgate, England, on 12 October 1845. Her remains were buried in the [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]]' burial ground at [[Barking, London|Barking]].&lt;ref name=quakers/&gt; Seamen of the Ramsgate Coast Guard flew their flag at half mast in respect of Mrs Fry; a practice that until this occasion had been officially reserved for the death of a ruling monarch.&lt;ref&gt;'Memoirs of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry' (second edition) by Rev. Thomas Timpson. London : Aylott and Jones, 1847&lt;/ref&gt;
More than a thousand people stood in silence during the burial at the Ramsgate memorial

==Memorials==

[[File:Fry.JPG|thumb|Fry's statue in the [[Old Bailey]]]]
There are a number of memorials which commemorate places where Fry lived. There are plaques located at her birthplace of Gurney Court in [[Norwich]]; her childhood home of Earlham Hall; St. Mildred's Court, [[City of London]], where she lived when she was first married; and Arklow House, her final home and place of death in [[Ramsgate]]. Her name heads the list on the southern face of the Reformers Monument in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], [[London]]. She is depicted in stained glass at [[All Saints' Church, Cambridge|All Saints Church, Cambridge]] alongside [[Edith Cavell]] and [[Josephine Butler]].

Due to her work as a prison reformer, there are several memorials to Elizabeth Fry. One of the buildings which make up the Home Office headquarters, [[2 Marsham Street|2 Marsham St]], is named after her. She is also commemorated in prisons and courthouses, including a terracotta bust in the gatehouse of [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs]] and a stone statue in the [[Old Bailey]]. The [[Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies]] honours her memory by advocating for women who are in the criminal justice system. They also celebrate and promote a National Elizabeth Fry Week in [[Canada]] each May.

Elizabeth Fry is also commemorated in a number of educational and care-based settings. The [[University of East Anglia]]'s School of Social Work and Psychology is housed in a building named after her. There is an Elizabeth Fry Ward at [[Scarborough General Hospital]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. A road is named for Fry at [[Guilford College]], a school in Greensboro, North Carolina, which was founded by Quakers. There is a bust of Elizabeth Fry located in East Ham Library, Newham Borough of London.

Quakers also acknowledge Elizabeth Fry as a prominent member. Her grave at the former [[Society of Friends]] Burial Ground, located off Whiting Avenue in [[Barking, London|Barking]], Essex, was restored and received a new commemorative marble plinth in October 2003. In February 2007, a plaque was erected in her honour at the Friends Meeting House in Upper Goat Lane, Norwich. Fry is also depicted in the [[Quaker Tapestry]], on panels E5 and E6. She is also honoured by other Christian denominations. In the Lady Chapel of Manchester's Anglican Cathedral, one of the portrait windows of Noble Women on the west wall of the Chapel features Elizabeth Fry. The Church of England includes her on its [https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx liturgical calendar] on Oct. 12.

Since 2001, Fry has been depicted on the reverse of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|£5 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England]]. She is shown reading to prisoners at Newgate Prison. The design also incorporates a key, representing the key to the prison which was awarded to Fry in recognition of her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/current/current_5.htm|title=Current Banknotes £5 Note (Elizabeth Fry)|publisher=Bank of England|accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2016, Fry's image on these notes was replaced by that of [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Katie|journal=The Guardian|date=26 April 2013 |title=New £5 note replaces Elizabeth Fry with Sir Winston Churchill|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/26/winston-churchill-new-five-pound-note|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the social reformers honoured on an issue of UK commemorative stamps in 1976.

Fry kept extensive diaries which give unique insight into her work, life and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005|title=The transcription and notation of Elizabeth Fry's journal 1780-1845|url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/6298|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional labor''' is the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title-link=The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling |title=The managed heart: commercialization of human feeling |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-520-05454-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grandey |first1= Alicia A. |year=2000 |title=Emotion regulation in the workplace: A new way to conceptualize emotional labor |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1076-8998.5.1.95 |journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.1037/1076-8998.5.1.95 |pages=59–100 |pmid=10658889}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, workers are expected to regulate their emotions during interactions with customers, co-workers and superiors. This includes analysis and decision making in terms of the expression of emotion, whether actually felt or not, as well as its opposite: the suppression of emotions that are felt but not expressed.

Roles that have been identified as requiring emotional labor include but are not limited to Mother/Wife, those involved in [[public administration]] (especially the palace intrigues of a ruling body, these being an eternal literary theme), guarded professions of secrecy (such as espionage, national security, military intelligence, psychiatry, clerisy, and law), [[flight attendant]], [[Day care|daycare worker]], [[Nursing home care|nursing home worker]], [[Nursing|nurse]], [[Physician|doctor]], [[Cashier|store clerk]], [[Call centre|call center worker]], [[teacher]], [[librarian]], [[social worker]]; most roles in a [[hotel]], [[motel]], [[tavern]], [[bar]], [[pub]], and [[restaurant]]; and jobs in the media, such as television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |contribution=Preface to the 2012 edition |editor-last=Russell Hochschild |editor-first=Arlie |editor-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title-link=The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling |title=The managed heart: commercialization of human feeling |page=x |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-520-27294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As particular economies move from a [[manufacturing]]- to a [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service-based economy]], more workers in a variety of occupational fields are expected to manage their emotions according to employer demands when compared to sixty years ago.

==Definition: emotional labor versus emotion work==
[[File:Waitress2k7.jpg|thumb|A [[waitress]] at a restaurant is expected to do emotional labor, such as smiling and expressing positive emotion towards customers]]

The [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]] provides the first definition of emotional labor, which is a form of emotion regulation that creates a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; The related term [[emotion work]] (also called "emotion management") refers to "these same acts done in a private context", such as within the private sphere of one's home or interactions with [[family]] and [[friendship|friends]]. Hochschild identified three emotion regulation strategies: [[cognitive]], bodily, and expressive.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title=Emotion work, feeling rules, and social structure |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=551–575 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |jstor=2778583 |date=November 1979 |ref=harv |doi=10.1086/227049}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within cognitive emotion work, one attempts to change images, ideas, or thoughts in hopes of changing the feelings associated with them.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may associate a family picture with feeling happy and think about said picture whenever attempting to feel happy. Within bodily emotion work, one attempts to change physical symptoms in order to create a desired [[emotion]].&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt deep breathing in order to reduce anger. Within expressive emotion work, one attempts to change expressive gestures to change inner feelings.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt to smile when trying to feel happy. One becomes aware of emotion work most often when one's feelings do not fit the situation. For instance, when one does not feel sad at a funeral, one becomes acutely aware of the feelings appropriate for that situation.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt;

While emotion work happens within the private sphere, emotional labor is emotion management within the workplace according to employer expectations. According to Hochschild (1983), the emotion management by employers creates a situation in which this emotion management can be exchanged in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; According to Hochschild (1983), [[Job (role)|jobs]] involving emotional labor are defined as those that:

# require face-to-face or voice-to-voice contact with the public.
# require the worker to produce an emotional state in another person.
# allow the employer, through training and supervision, to exercise a degree of control over the emotional activities of employees.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

Hochschild (1983) argues that within this [[commodification]] process, service workers are estranged from their own feelings in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

==Determinants==
# Societal, occupational, and organizational [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. For example, [[empirical]] evidence indicates that in typically "busy" stores there is more legitimacy to express negative emotions, than there is in typically "slow" stores, in which employees are expected to behave accordingly to the display rules;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rafaeli |first1=A. |last2=Sutton |first2=R.

# Supervisory regulation of display rules; That is, supervisors are likely to be important definers of display rules at the job level, given their direct influence on worker's beliefs about high-performance expectations. Moreover, supervisors' impressions of the need to suppress negative emotions on the job influence the employees' impressions of that display rule.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"/&gt;

== Surface and deep acting ==
Original description of this emotion management process, researchers have focused on surface acting and deep acting as the primary strategies that employees use to regulate their emotions. Surface acting involves a "faking" process through which outward expressions are altered, yet internal feelings are left intact (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=The managed heart: The commercialization of feeling |last=Hochschild |first=A.R. |date=1983 |journal=University of California Press |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, deep acting is an effortful process through which employees change their internal feelings to align with organizational expectations, producing more natural and genuine emotional displays (Grandey et al., 2013)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse Perspectives on Emotion Regulation at Work |last=Grandy |first=A. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn= |location= |pages=3–17 |last2=Diefendorff |first2=J.M. |last3=Rupp |first3=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3). Although the underlying regulatory processes involved in each approach differ, the objective of both, is typically to show positive emotions, which are presumed to impact the feelings of customers and bottom-line outcomes (e.g., sales, positive recommendations, and repeat business; Pugh, 2001; Tsai, 2001).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, S.

In the past, emotional labor demands and display rules were viewed as a characteristic of particular [[wikt:occupation|occupations]], such as [[waiting staff|restaurant workers]], [[cashier]]s, [[hospital]] workers, bill collectors, [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselors]], [[secretary|secretaries]], and nurses. However, display rules have been conceptualized not only as [[role]] requirements of particular occupational groups, but also as [[interpersonal]] job demands, which are shared by many kinds of occupations.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diefendorff |first1=J.

In 1991, Sutton did an in-depth [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] study into bill collectors at a [[collection agency]].&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert I. |last=Sutton |year=1991 |title=Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors |journal=[[Administrative Science Quarterly]] |issue=2 |volume=36 |pages=245–268 |jstor=2393355 |doi=10.2307/2393355 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2393355}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that unlike the other jobs described here where employees need to act cheerful and concerned, bill collectors are selected and [[socialized]] to show irritation to most [[debtor]]s.  Specifically, the collection agency hired agents who seemed to be easily aroused. The newly hired agents were then trained on when and how to show varying emotions to different types of debtors.  As they worked at the collection agency, they were closely monitored by their supervisors to make sure that they frequently conveyed urgency to debtors.

Bill collectors' emotional labor consists of not letting angry and hostile debtors make them angry and to not feel guilty about pressuring friendly debtors for money.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They coped with angry debtors by publicly showing their anger or making jokes when they got off the phone.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They minimized the guilt they felt by staying emotionally detached from the debtors.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt;

=== Food-industry workers ===

====Wait staff====
[[File:Waitress taking an order.jpg|thumb|A waitress taking an order in an American restaurant]]

In her 1991 study of [[waitresses]] in [[Philadelphia]], Paules examines how these workers assert control and protect their [[self identity]] during interactions with [[customers]]. In [[restaurant]] work, Paules argues, workers' subordination to customers is reinforced through "[[cultural]] symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about [[service sector|service work]]." Because the waitresses were not strictly regulated by their [[employers]], waitresses' interactions with customers were controlled by the waitresses themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the [[stereotypes]] and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, the waitresses studied were not negatively affected by their interactions with customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill that could be used to gain control over customers. Thus, the Philadelphia waitresses took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paules|first=G.F.|title=Dishing it out: power and resistance among waitresses in a New Jersey restaurant|year=1991|publisher=Temple University|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780877228875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Paules highlights the positive consequences of emotional labor for a specific population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of [[participant observation]] research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that [[casino]] waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bayard De Volo |first=L |title=Service and surveillance: infrapolitics at work among casino cocktail waitresses |journal=[[Social Politics|Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State &amp; Society]] |year=2003 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=346–376 |doi=10.1093/sp/jxg019 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sp/jxg019 }} [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/social_politics/v010/10.3de_volo.html Article at Project MUSE.]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping system]], both casino owners and customers control waitresses' [[behavior]] and [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management makes it difficult to change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress" /&gt;

====Fast-food employees====
By using participant observation and [[interview]]s, Leidner (1993) examines how employers in fast food restaurants regulate workers' interactions with customers.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leidner|first=Robin|title=Fast food, fast talk: service work and the routinization of everyday life|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520085008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leidner (1993), employers attempt to regulate workers' interactions with customers only under certain conditions. Specifically, when employers attempt to regulate worker-customer interactions, employers believe that "the quality of the interaction is important to the success of the enterprise", that workers are "unable or unwilling to conduct the interactions appropriately on their own", and that the "tasks themselves are not too complex or context-dependent."&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), regulating employee interactions with customers involves standardizing workers' personal interactions with customers. At the [[McDonald's]] fast food restaurants in Leidner's (1993) study, these interactions are strictly scripted, and workers' compliance with the scripts and regulations are closely monitored.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

Along with examining employers' attempts to regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' respond to these regulations.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage in some form of emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a [[smile]] and friendly attitude independent of their own [[mood (psychology)|mood]] or [[temperament]] at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used [[humor]] or [[exaggeration]] to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

===Physicians===
According to Larson and Yao (2005), [[empathy]] should characterize physicians' interactions with their patients because, despite advancement in medical [[technology]], the interpersonal relationship between [[physicians]] and [[patients]] remains essential to quality [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name=Physicians&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larson |first1=E.B. |last2=Yao |first2=X. |title=Clinical empathy as emotional labor in the patient-physician relationship |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|The Journal of the American Medical Association]] |year=2005 |volume=293 |issue=9 |pages=1100–1106 |pmid=15741532 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.9.1100 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.293.9.1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians consider empathy a form of emotional labor. Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in emotional labor through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional [[contentment|satisfaction]] when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.&lt;ref name=Physicians /&gt;

===Police work===
According to Martin (1999), [[police]] work involves substantial amounts of emotional labor by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion in the presence of other [[officers]] and [[citizens]].&lt;ref name="Police Officers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=S.E. |title=Police force or police service? Gender and emotional labor |journal=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science#The Annals|The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |year=1999 |volume=561 |issue=1 |jstor=1049285 |doi=10.1177/000271629956100108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically [[masculine]] work that focuses on fighting [[crime]], policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much [[anger]], [[sympathy]], or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work, due to the [[sexist]] views of many police officers.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt; While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt;

===Public administration ===
Many scholars argue that the amount of emotional work required between all levels of government is greatest on the local level. It is at the level of cities and counties that the responsibility lies for day to day emergency preparedness, firefighters, law enforcement, public education, public health, and family and children's services. Citizens in a community expect the same level of satisfaction from their government, as they receive in a [[customer service]]-oriented job. This takes a considerate amount of work for both employees and employers in the field of public administration. There are two comparisons that represent emotional labor within public administration, "Rational Work versus Emotion Work", and "Emotional Labor versus Emotional Intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=6–7 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance====

When public administrators perform emotional labor, many scholars argue administrators are dealing with significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The reason for this is because they are on the front lines of the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emotional Labor and Crisis Response, Working on a Razor's Edge|last=Mastracci|first=Sharron H.|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2012|isbn=|location=Armonk, New York|pages=20–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: rational work vs. emotion work ====
According to Mary Guy, Public administration does not only focus on the business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=63 |last2=Newman |last3=Mastracci |first2=Meredith |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: vs. emotional intelligence ====
Knowing how to suppress and manage one's own feelings is known as [[emotional intelligence]], the ability to control one's emotions and to be able to do this at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=64–65 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) use the term "emotional proletariat" to describe [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service jobs]] in which "workers exercise emotional labor wherein they are required to display friendliness and [[deference]] to customers."&lt;ref name="Gender Book"&gt;{{citation |last1=Macdonald |first1=Cameron L. |last2=Sirianni |first2=Carmen |contribution=The service society and the changing experience of work |editor1-last=Macdonald |editor1-first=Cameron L. |editor2-last=Sirianni |editor2-first=Carmen |title=In working in the service society |year=1996 |pages=1–28 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-480-2 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of deference, these occupations tend to be stereotyped as female jobs, independent of the actual number of women working the job. According to Macdonald and Sirianni (1996), because deference is a characteristic demanded of all those in [[disadvantaged]] structural positions, especially women, when deference is made a job requirement, women are likely to be overrepresented in these jobs. Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) claim that "[i]n no other area of wage labor are the personal characteristics of the workers so strongly associated with the nature of the work."&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt; Thus, according to Macdonald and Sirianna (1996), although all workers employed within the service economy may have a difficult time maintaining their [[dignity]] and self-identity due to the demands of emotional labor, such an issue may be especially problematic for women workers.&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt;

Emotional labor also affects women by perpetuating [[occupational segregation]] and the [[gender wage gap]].&lt;ref name="Gender Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guy|first1=Mary Ellen|last2=Newman|first2=Meredith A.|date=|year=2004|title=Women's jobs, men's jobs: sex segregation and emotional labor|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|journal=[[Public Administration Review]]|volume=64|issue=3|pages=289–298|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job segregation, which is the systematic tendency for men and women to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap can at least be partially attributed to emotional labor. Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and [[empathy|empathizing]] are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations: "Excluded from job descriptions and performance evaluations, the work is invisible and uncompensated. Public service relies heavily on such skills, yet civil service systems, which are designed on the assumptions of a bygone era, fail to acknowledge and compensate emotional labor." According to Guy and Newman (2004), women working in positions that require emotion labour in addition to regular work are not compensated for this additional labour because of the sexist notion that the additional labour is to be expected of them by the fact of being a woman. This suggests that Guy and Newman believe a man conducting emotional labour would be compensated more than a woman would, however, if women are inproportionately hired for positions requiring emotional work, that does not immediately explain a wage gap comparable to men.

==Implications==

Positive affective display in service interactions, such as [[smiling]] and conveying friendliness, are positively associated with customer positive feelings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pugh |first1=S.D. |year=2001 |title=Service with a smile: emotional contagion in the service encounter |jstor=3069445 |journal=[[Academy of Management Journal]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1018–1027 |doi=10.2307/3069445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and important outcomes, such as intention to return, intention to recommend a store to others, and perception of overall service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parasuraman |first1=A. |last2=Zeithaml |first2=V.A. |last3=Berry |first3=L.L. |date=Spring 1988 |title=SERVQUAL: a multiple-item scale for measuring customer perceptions of service quality |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00224359/70 |journal=Journal of Retailing |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=12–40 }} [http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063550/http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that emotional labor may lead to employees' [[emotional exhaustion]] and [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]] over time, and may also reduce employees' [[job satisfaction]]. That is, higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related to higher levels of employees' emotional exhaustion,&lt;ref name="grandey_2005"/&gt; and lower levels of employees' job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brotheridge |first1=C. M. |last2=Grandey |first2=A. A. |year=2002 |title=Emotional labor and burnout: Comparing two perspectives of people work |work=Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume=60|publisher=Aop.psy.unibe.ch |url=http://www.aop.psy.unibe.ch/lehre/proseminar_burnout/9_23.05.07%20Brotheridge%20Grandey%202002.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1006/jvbe.2001.1815 |pages=17–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is empirical evidence that higher levels of emotional labor demands are not uniformly rewarded with higher wages. Rather, the reward is dependent on the level of general cognitive demands required by the job. That is, occupations with high cognitive demands evidence wage returns with increasing emotional labor demands; whereas occupations low in cognitive demands evidence a wage "penalty" with increasing emotional labor demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glomb |first1=T.M. |last2=Kammeyer-Mueller |first2=J. |last3=Rotundo |first3=M. |year=2004 |title=Emotional labor demands and compensating wage differentials |work=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=89 |pages=700–714 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |pmid=15327355 }} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220022147/http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping skills===
[[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] occurs in response to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use to adjust to the changes that occur in your life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/dual-diagnosis-program/News_and_Resources/How_Do_You_Cope |title=How Do You Cope |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2015 |website=ucla.edu |publisher=UCLA |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform to the best of their ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diefendorff|first=J|last2=Gosserand|first2=R|date=2003|title=Understanding the emotional labor process: A control theory perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=24|pages=945–959|doi=10.1002/job.230|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=November 20, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''exchange of women''' is an element of [[alliance theory]] - the [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and other [[anthropologist]]s who see society as based upon the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] treatment of women as property, being given to other men to cement alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Book and the Text: The Bible and Literary Theory|author=[[Regina Schwartz]]|publisher=Blackwell|year=1990|isbn=0-631-16861-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such formal exchange may be seen in the ceremony of the traditional Christian [[wedding]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} in which the [[bride]] is given to the [[Bridegroom|groom]] by her father.

==Kinship==
The structuralist view of kinship was laid out in Lévi-Strauss' grand statement: ''Les Structures élémentaires de la parenté'' (The Elementary Structures of Kinship).  In this, he combined [[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]]' ideas about the importance of [[gift]]s in primitive societies with the role of the [[incest]] taboo in forcing exchanges of mates outside of closely related family groups.  The resulting ''exchange of women'' is asymmetric in that men have power over women which is not reciprocated.  The resulting social structures provide a framework for treating the oppression of women as a [[social construct]] rather than being a matter of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trxGYWX_XNgC|title=Feminist Anthropology|chapter=4 The Traffic in Women|author=Gayle Rubin|pages=92–95|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-0196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical patriarchy==
Men in ancient [[Hebrew]] culture established and negotiated their relations with other men through the exchange of female relatives.  This is seen in [[Old Testament]] narratives such as the stories spread across the books of [[Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Sex, Honor and Power in the Deuteronomistic History: A Narratological and Anthropological Analysis|author=Kenneth A. Stone|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=1996|isbn=1-85075-640-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal treatment==
In [[Afghanistan]] and remote areas of [[Pakistan]], women may be exchanged in compensation for a debt or offence such as murder.  This practice is known as ''[[Swara (custom)|swara]]''.  Pakistan's constitution prohibits this with a penalty of 3 to 10 years of imprisonment but the custom still persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C07%5C16%5Cstory_16-7-2008_pg11_1|title=Trapped by traditions|author=Sohail Chaudhry|date=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
The exchange of women in the course of male bonding appears as a theme in the novels ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and ''[[Tropic of Capricorn (novel)|Tropic of Capricorn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.henry-miller.com/narrative-literature/a-generalized-exchange-of-women.html|title=Henry Miller and the Rise of New Critical Modernism|chapter=7.

'''Face-Negotiation Theory''' was a theory first proposed by [[Penelope Brown|Brown]] and [[Stephen Levinson|Levinson]] (1978) to understand how people from different cultures manage rapport and disagreements. The theory posits "face", or self-image, as a universal phenomenon that pervades across cultures. In conflicts, one's face is threatened; and thus the person tends to save or restore his or her face. This set of communicative behaviors, according to the theory, is called "facework".  Since people frame the situated meaning of "face" and enact "facework" differently from one culture to the next, the theory poses a cultural-general framework to examine facework negotiation.

==Background==
Face-negotiation theory is primarily based on the research of Brown and Levinson. In this theory, "face" is a metaphor for self-image, which originates from two Chinese conceptualizations: lien and mien-tzu. Lien is the internal moral face that involves shame, integrity, debasement, and honor issues. Mien-tzu, on the other hand, is the external social face that involves social recognition, position, authority, influence and power.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting-1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ting-Toomey|last2=Kurogi|title=Facework competence in intercultural conflict: An updated face-negotiation theory|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date=1998|volume=22|issue=2|pages=187–225|doi=10.1016/s0147-1767(98)00004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] situated [[Face (sociological concept)|"face"]] in contemporary Western research and conceptualized the terms lien and mien-tzu as identity and ego..&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that face is a concern for one's projected image that is both immediate and spontaneous and is tied to the dynamics of social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Rogan &amp; Hammer, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Correspondingly, "facework" denotes actions taken to maintain consistency between the self and public line. Further research by Penelope Brown and [[Stephen Levinson]] on [[Politeness theory|politeness]] suggests that the desire for face is a universal concern.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Levinson, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Turner &amp; Zhao, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and Levinson further suggest that face can refer to two wants of the individual- the positive face that necessitates approval by others and the negative face that requires that one's actions or thoughts are unimpeded by others. Thus participants wants are of more importance than the interaction itself in face saving view of politeness. In fact, researchers Brown and Levinson posit that face is something that "is emotionally invested, and can be lost, maintained, or enhanced, and must be constantly attended to in interaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.604.3117&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ting-Toomey expands this thinking and conceptualizes face as an individual's claimed sense of favorable social self-image in a relational and network context.&lt;ref name=Ting-1988&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=Intercultural conflict styles: A face negotiation theory|editor1-last=Kim|editor1-first=Y.Y.|editor2-last=Gudykunst|editor2-first=W.B.|title=Theories in intercultural communication|date=1988|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=213–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facework is defined as clusters of communicative behaviors that are used to enact self-face and to uphold, challenge/threaten, or support the other person's face.&lt;ref name="Ting-1998"/&gt;

With these concepts and frameworks, face-negotiation theory investigates intercultural conflict styles. The perceived or actual conflict differences revolve around three issues: content, relational, and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot &amp; Hocker, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Content conflict refers to the substantive issues external to the individual involved. Relational conflict refers to how individuals define, or would like to define, the particular relationship in that particular conflict episode. Identity-based conflict concerns issues of issues of identity confirmation-rejection, respect-disrespect, and approval-disapproval.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=The matrix of face: An updated face-negotiation theory|editor1-last=Gudykunst|editor1-first=W.B.|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=71–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, identity issues are tided closely to culture-based face-orientation factors. A face-threatening episode is an identity expectancy violation episode. Thus, the face-negotiation theory views conflict, intercultural conflict in particular, as a situation that demands active facework management from the two interdependent conflict parties.

The theory has gone through multiple iterations since its creation. There is a 1988 version of seven assumptions and 12 propositions,&lt;ref name="Ting-1988"/&gt; a 1998 version of seven assumptions and 32 propositions,&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt; and most recent the 2005 version of seven assumptions and 24 propositions.&lt;ref name="Ting-2005"/&gt;

==Components==

===Assumptions===
Face and facework are universal phenomena.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=Translating conflict face-negotiation theory into practice|editor1-last=Landis|editor1-first=Dan|editor2-last=Bennett|editor2-first=Janet M.|editor3-last=Bennett|editor3-first=Millton J.|title=Handbook of Intercultural Training|date=2004|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=217–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Face-Negotiation Theory perspective stresses the impact of culture on the situated meaning of face and the enactment of facework. Thus, the theory assumes that:&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;
#Communication in all cultures is based on maintaining and negotiating face.
#Face is problematic when identities are questioned.
#Differences in individualistic vs. collectivistic and small vs. large power distance cultures profoundly shape face management.
#Individualistic cultures prefer self oriented facework, and collectivistic cultures prefer other oriented facework.
#Small power distance cultures prefer an "individuals are equal" framework, whereas large power distance cultures prefer a hierarchical framework.
#Behavior is also influenced by cultural variances, individual, relational, and situational factors.
#Competence in intercultural communication is a culmination of knowledge and mindfulness.

===Taxonomies===
Face-negotiation theory primarily deals with five sets of themes: face orientation or concerns, face movements, facework interaction strategies, conflict communication styles, and face content domains.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting-1988 /&gt; In the 2005 version of theory, the five thematic clusters are referred as "core taxonomies".&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;

====Face orientations====

The orientation of face determines the focus with which the face negotiator will direct her or his attention and energy of the conflict messages.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; Because of different concerns, caused by different underlying cultural values, face negotiators may orient towards self-face (one's own image), other face (the other conflict party's image) or mutual face (both parties' image and/or the image of the relationship).&lt;ref name=Ting-1988 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in [[Individualism|individualist]] cultures, such as the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, there is great value on personal rights, freedoms and the "do it yourself" attitude.  In [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures such as Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia, more value is placed on "we" vs. "I".  The needs of the group outweigh the needs of the individual.  One-third of the world lives in an individualist society, while the other two thirds are identified with collectivist cultures.

Face orientation also involves the concept of [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|power distance]].  People from large power distance cultures accept unequal power distributions, are reliant on established hierarchy, and understand that rewards and sanctions are based on social position.  People from small power distance cultures value equal power distributions, symmetric relations, and rewards and sanctions based on performance.  The United States is an example of a small power distance culture, while Japan embodies a large power distance culture.

Drawing on research of [[Geert Hofstede]], face-negotiation theory notes that while individualism and power distance are two separate dimensions, they are correlated. Highly individualistic cultures tend to be low in power distance, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Face movements====

Face movement refers to the options that a negotiator faces in choosing whether to maintain, defend and/or upgrade self-face versus other-face in a conflict episode. There are four opportunities a mediator has in regards to their concern for self-face, your personal image and other-face, the counterpart's image of themselves that define face movements:
#If there is a high level of concern for both self-face and other-face, the result is mutual-face protection.
#If there is a low level of concern for both self-face and other-face, the result is mutual-face obliteration.
#If there is a high level of concern for self-face but a low level of concern for other-face, the result is self-face defense.
#If there is a high level of concern for other-face but a low level of concern for self-face, the result is other-face defense.

Ting-Toomey asserts that several conditions must be perceived as severe in order for a negotiator to feel his face is threatened; the importance of the culturally approved facework that is violated, feelings of mistrust because of a large distance between cultures, the importance of the conflict topic, the power distance between the two parties, and the perception of the parties as outgroup members are all conditions which must be made salient for face-threatening communication to occur.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; Whether or not a person engages in a conflict depends on how face-threatening the situation is perceived.

In an individualistic culture, the more self-face threatening the conflict, the more likely the individual will engage in an attack.  In a collectivistic culture, where mutual-face concern is important, avoidance of conflict may prevail in order for the situation to be defused. Collectivistic communicators may also require a third-party negotiation to make progress in finding a resolution.

====Facework interaction strategies====

On a broad level, individualistic cultures operate with a more direct, low-context facework with importance placed on verbal communication and nonverbal gestures for emphasis.  Collectivistic cultures operate in a more indirect, high context facework emphasizing nonverbal subtleties.  There are three prevalent facework strategies: dominating, avoiding, and integrating.  Dominating facework is characterized by trying to maintain a credible image with the goal of winning the conflict.  Avoiding facework attempts to preserve harmony in the relationship by dealing with the conflict indirectly.  Integrating facework focuses on content resolution and maintaining the relationship.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;

Along the face concern/orientation dimension, facework is at play before (preventative), during, and after (restorative) the situation.  Preventative facework is an attempt to minimize face-loss before the threat occurs.  Preventative strategies include credentialing, appealing for suspended judgment, pre-disclosure, pre-apology, hedging, and disclaimers.&lt;ref name="Culpach"&gt;Culpach &amp; Metts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectivistic cultures tend to employ more preventative strategies than individualistic cultures.  Restorative facework attempts to repair face that was lost.  Restorative strategies include excuses, justifications, direct aggression, humor, physical remediation, passive aggressiveness, avoidance, and apologies.&lt;ref name="Culpach" /&gt;  Individualistic cultures are more likely to use restorative facework than collectivistic cultures.

Facework differs from conflict styles by employing face-saving strategies which can be used prior to, during, or after a conflict episode and can be used in a variety of identity-threatening and identity-protection situations.  These strategies are focused on relational and face identity beyond conflict goal issues.  Conflict styles are specific strategies used to engage or disengage from a conflict situation.  Preventative and restorative face-work strategies are typically employed when one's face is being threatened.

====Conflict communication styles====

Conflict style consists of learned behaviors developed through socialization within one's culture.  Rahim&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; based his classification of conflict styles into two dimensions.  The first dimension demonstrates the concern for self, how important it is for the individual to maintain their own face or that of their culture (this is rated on a high to low continuum) and the second is concern for others, how important is it to the individual to help them maintain their own face (also rated on a high to low continuum). The two dimensions are combined to create five styles for dealing with conflict. The individual will choose a style of handling conflict based on the importance of saving their face and that of the face of the other. 
#'''Dominating''': One person's position or goal above the other.
#'''Avoiding''': Eluding the conflict topic, the conflict party, or the conflict situation altogether.
#'''Obliging''': High concern for the other person's conflict interest above a person's own interest. 
#'''Compromising''': A give-and-take concession approach in order to reach a midpoint agreement.
#'''Integrating''': A solution closure that involves high concern for one's self and high concern for the other.

In 2000 Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, and Yee-Jung incorporated three additional conflict communication styles to the original five.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These three have further enhanced conflict communication across cultures.

#'''Emotional Expression'''-Articulating a persons feelings in order to deal with and control conflict.
#'''Third Party Help'''-Resolving conflicts by enlisting additional help to manage communication.
#'''Passive Aggressive'''-Reacting to conflict in a roundabout way, placing blame indirectly.

Other researchers used a different way to group the conflict tactics. Ting-Toomey (1983) grouped strategies into three categories of tactics for handling conflict; integrative, distributive and passive-indirect.

Integrative conflict tactics incorporated integrating and compromising styles and is reflective of mutual-face and the need for a solution. Those who chose this tactic work with the other person involved in the conflict to get the best possible solution for both parties. Examples of Integrative tactics may include listening to the other, respecting their feelings, and providing their own personal viewpoints in a manner that assists in the negotiation.

Distributive conflict tactics use the dominating style of handling conflict, and emphasizes the individuals own power over the other. This style reflects self-face. Passive-indirect conflict tactics are consistent with obliging and avoiding styles of handling conflict and reflects other-face.

====Face content domains====

Face content domains refer to the different topics an individual will engage in facework on. Individuals have different face wants or face needs in a diverse range of communicative situations.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; There are six domains that an individual will operate in:
#'''Autonomy'''-represents our need for others to acknowledge our independence, self-sufficiency, privacy, boundary, nonimposition, control issues, and our consideration of other's autonomy face needs
#'''Inclusion'''-our need to be recognized as worthy companions, likeable, agreeable, pleasant, friendly, cooperative
#'''Status'''-need for others to admire our tangible and intangible assets or resources: appearance, attractiveness, reputation, position, power, and material worth
#'''Reliability'''-need for others to realize that we are trustworthy, dependable, reliable, loyal, and consistent in words and actions
#'''Competence'''-need for others to recognize our qualities or social abilities such as intelligence, skills, expertise, leadership, team-building, networking, conflict mediation, facework, and problem-solving skills
#'''Moral'''-need for others to respect our sense of integrity, dignity, honor, propriety, and morality

===Theoretical propositions===
The heart of Face Negotiation Theories are 24 propositions.  They are based on the seven assumptions and five taxonomies that have been proven in numerous cases and studies.  They describe facework on three levels of communication: cultural, individual, and situational.

''Cultural-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Individualistic cultures predominantly express self-face maintenance interests than collectivistic culture members do.
#Collectivistic cultures are more concerned with other-face maintenance than members of individualistic cultures.
#Members of collectivist cultures are more concerned with mutual-face maintenance than individualistic cultures.
#Members of individualistic cultures predominantly use direct and dominating facework strategies in conflict
#Collectivistic cultures tend to use avoidance strategies more than individualistic cultures do.
#Members of collectivistic cultures use more integrative facework strategies than individualistic culture members do.
#Individualistic cultures prefer dominating/competing conflict styles more than collectivistic cultures do.
#Individualistic cultures use more emotionally expressive conflict styles than collectivistic cultures do.
#Individualistic cultures use more aggressive conflict styles than members of collectivistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures use more avoidance techniques than members of individualistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures use more obliging conflict styles than members of individualistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures utilize compromising styles of conflict more than members of individualistic cultures.

''Individual-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Independent self is positively associated with self-face concern.
#Interdependent self is positively associated with other-/mutual-face concern.
#Self-face maintenance is associated with dominating/competing conflict style.
#Other-face maintenance is associated with avoiding/obliging conflict style.
#Other-face maintenance is associated with compromising/integrating conflict style.
#Independent self–construal is associated with dominating/competing conflict style.
#Interdependent self-construal is associated with obliging/avoiding.
#Interdependent self-construal is associated with compromising/integrating.
#Bi-construal is associated with compromising/integrating.
#Ambivalent is associated with neglect/third-party.

''Situational-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Individualist or independent-self personalities tend to express a greater degree of self-face maintenance concerns and less other-face maintenance concern in dealing with both ingroup and outgroup conflicts situations.
#Collectivist or interdependent-self personalities express a greater degree of other-face concerns with ingroup members and a greater degree of self-face maintenance concerns with outgroup members in intergroup conflict situations.

===Intercultural facework competence===
Reflecting on the final assumption, intercultural facework competence consists of another component of face-negotiation theory. 
Facework competence is conceptualized as an optimal integration of knowledge, mindfulness and communication skills in managing self's and other's face-related concerns.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt; To act competently in an intercultural conflict episode, the theory posits that individuals have to enhance their cultural knowledge and mindfulness in applying context-sensitive facework interaction skills.

====Knowledge dimension====

Knowledge here refers to the process of in-depth understanding of  phenomenon via a range of information gained through conscious learning and personal experiences. Building block concepts include: (1) individualism-collectivism, (2) power distance. (3) two contrastive "self/face" models, and (4) facework communication styles.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt;

====Mindfulness dimension====

Mindfulness means attending to one's internal assumptions, cognitions and emotions and simultaneously attuning attentively to the other's assumptions, cognitions and emotions while focusing the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;Thich, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; To be mindful of intercultural facework differences, we have to learn to see the unfamiliar behavior from a fresh context.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook /&gt; Thus, on a general level, mindfulness demands creative thinking and living.

==Applications==
As an intercultural communication theory, face-negotiation theory was first tested in and applied to the field of intercultural training and conflicts. However, researchers from other areas also find this theory applicable and relevant. Recent applications and examinations of the theory include following studies.

===Intercultural conflict training===

One direct application of face-negotiation theory is the design of intercultural conflict training frameworks. Part of the objective of face-negotiation theory, according to Ting-Toomey, is in fact to translate the theory into a viable framework for mindful intercultural conflict training.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook /&gt;

More specifically, intercultural conflict training revolves around international business negotiation, intercultural conflict mediation, managing intercultural miscommunication, and developing intercultural conflict competencies. Adapting face-negotiation theory, and also in combination with various communication researches such as Critical Incident, Intergroup Negotiation Simulation etc., Ting-Toomey designed a detailed three-day training session. Agenda outline, along with in class activities, lecture themes, and exercises, is provided in her design as well.

===Face concerns in interpersonal conflict===

This study by the author of the theory Stella Ting-Toomey and, Department of communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico, John G. Oetzel was done in order to discover if face was indeed a factor in determining "culture's influence on conflict behavior" (Ting-Toomey &amp; Oetzel, 2003).  There were 768 people from four different countries who partook in the study. The cultures represented were China, Germany, Japan, and the United States. China and Japan representing the collectivist countries and Germany and the United States as the individualist countries. Each contributor was given a survey in which they were to explain interpersonal conflict.&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey"&gt;Ting-Toomey &amp; Oetzel, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest findings are as follows.
#"Cultural individualism-collectivism had direct and indirect effects on conflict styles."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Independent self-construal related positively with self-face and interdependent self-construal related positively with other-face."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Self-face related positively with dominating conflict styles and other-face related positively with avoiding and integrating styles."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Face accounted for all of the total variance explained (100% of 19% total explained) in dominating, most of the total variance explained in integrating (70% of 20% total explained) when considering face concerns, cultural individualism-collectivism, and self-construals."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;

===Face and facework in conflicts with parents and siblings===

This study implemented by the author of this theory Stella Ting-Toomey, John Oetzel, Martha Idalia Chew-Sanchez, Richard Harris, Richard Wilcox, and Siegfried Stumpf observed how facework in conflict with parents and siblings is affected by culture, self-concept, and power distance. There were 449 people from four different countries and cultures that participated. Germany, Japan, Mexico, and the United States were the countries used in the study. The survey looked at 3 apprehensions of face and 11 behaviors of "facework". The results are as follows.
#"Self-construals had strong effects on face concerns and facework with independence positively associated with self-face and dominating facework and interdependence positively associated with other- and mutual-face and integrating and avoiding facework behaviors."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel"&gt;Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, Chew-Sanchez, Harris, Wilcox, &amp;Stumpf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Power distance had small, positive effects on self-face, other-face, avoiding facework, and dominating facework."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"National culture had small to medium effects with individualistic, small power distance cultures having more self-face and mutual-face and using more dominating and integrating facework and less avoiding facework."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Germans have more self-face and used defending more than U.S. Americans."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Japanese used more expression than Mexicans."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Individuals in conflict with parents were more likely to use respect and expression and less likely to use aggression, pretend, and third party than individuals in conflict with siblings."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;

===Face negotiation with mothers===

Motherhood of the Construction of "Mommy Identity" – Heisler &amp; Ellis Face Negotiation Theory suggests that, "USA culture simultaneously encourages connection and autonomy among individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Heisler &amp; Ellis, 2008, pp. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers do not want to be vulnerable so there is a "face" that is developed in the culture of mothers. Heisler and Ellis did a study on the "face" and reasons for face in motherhood. The results portrayed that the main reasons for keeping "face" in a culture of mothers are:

# Acceptance and approval: There is a fear of criticism and rejection by others. There is the avoidance face which deflects others attention. Acceptance face attracts attention.
# Personal Reasons: There are many internal pressures that mothers face. These include the guilt that they do not spend enough time with their children, insecurities and values they have are not being in met, and their self-esteem is low because of the fear of judgment.
# Mentoring/helping others: Mothers put on a face in order to appear as a good mother figure to younger mothers that look up to them. There are cultural expectations that can contribute to personal expectations for how mothers should act. Women's thoughts on mothering are not their own original ideas. They take on a lot of societal pressures. An example would be, if a mother's child acts poorly in public, it makes the mother look bad.

Motherhood and "face": Results from the same study showed that mothers participate in "Mommy face work." Depending on who they are talking to or interacting with. Mothers said to put on their highest face with friends, spouses, mothers and other family members.

===Physician communication in the operating room===
Kristin Kirschbaum applied face-negotiation theory to the [[health communication]] context, and specifically in the operating room environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschbaum, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the research, a survey was administered to anesthesiologists and surgeons at a teaching hospital in the southwestern United States to measure three variables commonly associated with face-negotiation theory: conflict-management style, face concern, and self-construal.
The results strongly support the theory, and significant positive correlations were found between independent self-construal and self-face concern for anesthesiologists and surgeons. Specific to this health communication context, the research shows differences between the two groups of operating-room physicians: surgeons are potentially more other-face oriented and that anesthesiologists are potentially more independently oriented. Further, both anesthesiologists and surgeons recognize the importance of collaboration as surgical team members.

The survey also finds that specific terms were contextually inappropriate for this population, e.g. the terms pride, dignity, or credibility demonstrated a need for error correlation. This suggests unique considerations of language. Along this line of thinking, the research recommends physician communication training to address both unique language considerations and different orientations to face concern and self-construal.

===Safe sex negotiation===
Gust Yep, noticing the potential vulnerability and emotional volatility of sexual interaction, applied face-negotiation theory to the safe sex negotiation context.&lt;ref&gt;Yep, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The study integrates various components of face-negotiation theory, and eight propositions are derived from empirical testing in intimate communication scenarios including East-West romantic dyads. The research is based on preliminary observations on personal interviews with two Asian women, aiming to predict intimate communication patterns between Asian women and Euro-American men. Specifically, low-high context and individualism-collectivism frameworks are used to draw the eight propositions.

'''&lt;big&gt;Face Saving in Business Request Emails&lt;/big&gt;'''

A study conducted on the exchange of business emails between Chinese &amp; American business associates presented how the structure of email requests affected the person's face &amp; impacted how the associates viewed the request. It was observed that direct requests in an email threatened the face of the recipient &amp; sender. It resulted in loss of face because the recipient was denied autonomy and acted in a socially unacceptable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=8f3e42a6-3912-425a-b23f-0ea1e50e4b18@sessionmgr4009|title=Saving Face: Reactions to Cultural Norm Violations in Business Request Emai...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Threat &amp; Disability ===
A research was conducted to gauge how disabled persons interact with able bodied individuals with regards to protecting one’s face and self-identity. The study considered students with not only physical disability but also disabilities not visually identifiable such as heart conditions and hearing impairment. Those with disabilities were threatened by the way others treated them and hence they chose more face-saving strategies. For instance, communication apprehension was noted in students with a hearing impairment and they reported less disclosure in the conversation. In fact, the study found that disabled students viewed asking help from able bodied individuals as a face threatening act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2994eace-95ee-4ef4-836b-8bc5e3f9b6c9@sessionmgr4010|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responding to Unethical Communication ===
A research in people’s reaction to unethical communication revealed that people use Face Threatening Acts in order to counter the apprehension in communication. According to Bisel et al. (2011), ‘denying unethical communication challenges both positive and negative face of the hearer”. An expression of disapproval threatens a person’s positive face which indicates the hearer’s need for approval and it impacts the person’s negative face because it affects the person’s autonomy. 

The study put forth a research question of associating politeness strategies and unethical communication. The strategies considered were don’t’ do the face threatening act, negative politeness, positive politeness and bald on strategy. The unethical communication was classified as one that was either deceptive, manipulative, exploitative, intrusive or coercive. The ideal strategic responses have been highlighted in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=aa4d04da-073a-41a5-8b98-5e9a8ff68e7c@sessionmgr4009|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Saving in Artwork Reviews ===
A research was conducted to study the use of face saving and face threatening acts in reviewing artwork. For the study, twelve reviews from the periodical Literatūra ir menas (Literature and Art) were randomly selected. The source for the research analysis was between 1970 -1975.

It was observed that reviewers generally had the face of the artist in mind before presenting their reviews. When presenting a negative review, reviewers threatened the positive face of the artist and hence also presented positive feedback in order to ‘save face’ of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=dbcd0891-58af-4084-a3ba-49718c0532fc@sessionmgr4006|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Concerns and the Intent to Apologize ===
A study was conducted among 317 Chinese and American participants to determine how the cultural variation between the two affected the intention to apologize. The cultural norms were categorized as the individualistic and collectivist cultures. According to Hofstede (1980), an individualistic culture lays emphasis on the identity of the “I” while collectivist cultures place more importance on the “we” and the harmony in groups. 

Apology, according to Goffman (1971), is the “offender’s device to remedy a social breach and to re-establish social harmony”. This study also took into account culture when trying to understand the intention to apologize. 

The cultural differences were more prominent especially as the intention took into account if the member (whose face was threatened by an act and thus necessities an apology) was an in-group or an out-group member. The study thus found that Chinese participants had a greater intention to apologize especially if their act threatened the positive face of the other individual. On the other hand, the U.S participants had the intention to apologize when their act threatened the negative face of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=9e9b619e-dd86-400d-a1dc-0de0aa7dd4b9@sessionmgr4007|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''feud''' {{IPAc-en|f|juː|d}}, referred to in more extreme cases as a '''blood feud''', '''vendetta''', '''faida''', '''beef''', '''clan war''', '''gang war''', or '''private war''', is a long-running argument or fight, often between [[social group]]s of people, especially [[family|families]] or [[clan]]s. Feuds begin because one party (correctly or incorrectly) perceives itself to have been attacked, insulted or wronged by another. Intense feelings of [[resentment]] trigger the initial [[Retributive justice|retribution]], which causes the other party to feel equally aggrieved and [[revenge|vengeful]]. The dispute is subsequently fuelled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory [[violence]]. This continual cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it extremely difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members or associates, can last for [[generation]]s, and may result in extreme acts of [[violence]]. They can be interpreted as an extreme outgrowth of social relations based in [[family honor]].

Until the [[early modern period]], feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manaraefan.co.uk/index_files/Page3400.htm |title=Revenue, Lordship, Kinship &amp; Law |publisher=Manaraefan.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were regulated to some degree. For example, [[Serbs|Serb]] culture calls this ''krvna osveta'', meaning "blood revenge", which had unspoken{{dubious|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- if people didn't talk about the rules of ''krvna osveta'', how did they know about them? --&gt; but highly valued rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=Christopher|title=Blood Revenge: The Anthropology of Feuding in Montenegro and Other Tribal Societies|year=1984|publisher=The University of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kansas|isbn=0-7006-0245-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tribal societies, the blood feud, coupled with the practice of [[blood money (term)|blood wealth]], functioned as an effective form of social control for limiting and ending conflicts between individuals and groups who are related by [[kinship]], as described by anthropologist [[Max Gluckman]] in his article "The Peace in the Feud"&lt;ref&gt;Gluckman, Max. "The Peace in the Feud". ''Past and Present'', 1955, 8(1):1-14&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955.

== Blood feuds ==
{{Redirect|Blood feud||Blood Feud (disambiguation)}}
A '''blood feud''' is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or [[honor|dishonored]] seeking vengeance by killing or otherwise physically punishing the culprits or their relatives. In the [[English-speaking world]], the Italian word '''''vendetta''''' is used to mean a blood feud, but in reality it means (personal) "vengeance" or "revenge", originating from the [[Latin]] ''vindicta'' ([[wikt:vengeance|vengeance]]), while the word ''[[:wiktionary:faida|faida]]'' would be more appropriate for a blood feud. In the English-speaking world, "vendetta" is sometimes extended to mean any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed. Sometimes, it is not mutual, but rather refers to a prolonged series of hostile acts waged by one person against another without reciprocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vendetta |title=Definition of vendetta |work=Merriam-Webster dictionary online|publisher=Merriam-Webster.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Blood feuds were common in societies with a weak rule of law (or where the state does not consider itself responsible for mediating this kind of dispute), where family and kinship ties are the main source of [[authority]]. An entire family is considered responsible for the actions of any of its members. Sometimes two separate branches of the same family have even come to blows, or worse, over some dispute.

[[File:1673 Heintz Wettstreit auf der Ponte dei Pugni in Venedig anagoria.JPG|thumb|Ponte dei Pugni ("Bridge of Fists") in [[Venice]] was used by rival clans to stage fist fights]]
The practice has mostly disappeared with more centralized societies where [[law enforcement]] and [[criminal law]] take responsibility for punishing lawbreakers.

In [[Homeric]] [[ancient Greece]], the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: "Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vengeance... Feud is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of revenges; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John Gwyn |last=Griffiths |title=The Divine Verdict: A Study of Divine Judgement in the Ancient Religions |year=1991 |page=90 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-09231-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ancient Israel|ancient Hebraic]] context, it was considered the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil on behalf of God. The executor of the law of blood-revenge who personally put the initial killer to death was given a special designation: ''[[go'el haddam]]'', the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer ([[Book of Numbers]] 35: 19, etc.). Six [[Cities of Refuge]] were established to provide protection and [[due process]] for any unintentional manslayers. The avenger was forbidden from harming the unintentional killer if the killer took refuge in one of these cities. As the ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' states: "Since life was viewed as sacred ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9.6), no amount of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be [[lex talionis|'life for life']] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21.23; [[Deuteronomy]] 19.21)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible |first1=Bruce M. |last1=Metzger |first2=Michael D. |last2=Coogan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=68 |isbn=0-19-504645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Marc Bloch]]:
{{bquote|
The [[Middle Ages]], from beginning to end, and particularly the [[feudal]] era, lived under the sign of private [[revenge|vengeance]]. The [[Blame|onus]], of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the ''faide'' (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe — 'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call ''faida''', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a [[chieftain]], took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Bloch]], trans. L. A. Manyon, ''Feudal Society'', Vol. I, 1965, p. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Rita of Cascia]], a popular 15th-century Italian saint, was canonized by the [[Catholic Church]] due mainly to her great effort to end a feud in which her family was involved and which claimed the life of her husband.

The blood feud has certain similarities to the ritualized warfare found in many [[pre-industrial]] tribes. Thus, for instance, more than a third of [[Ya̧nomamö]] males, on average, died from [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the [[enslavement]] of neighboring tribes such as the [[Marueta people|Macu]] before the arrival of European settlers and government.&lt;ref name="Keeley"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. ''[[War Before Civilization|War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage]]'' Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan's feudal past, the [[samurai]] class upheld the honor of their family, clan, and their lord by ''katakiuchi'' ({{lang|ja|敵討ち}}), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the [[Forty-seven Ronin]], others were given official permission with specific targets.

At the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s [[Diet of Worms (1495)|''Reichstag'' at Worms in 1495 AD]], the right of waging feuds was abolished. The [[Imperial Reform]] proclaimed an "eternal [[public peace]]" (''[[Ewiger Landfriede]]'') to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]]s, and it defined a new [[standing army|standing imperial army]] to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted.&lt;!-- non-reliable source &lt;ref&gt;{{NNDB|id=399/000096111|name=Maximilian I|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed a family rival in [[Prague]], and the town councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed.

In Greece, the custom of blood feud is found in several parts of the country, for instance in [[Crete]] and [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]]. Throughout history, the [[Maniots]] have been regarded by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice [[Maniots#Vendettas|blood feuds]], known in the Maniot dialect of Greek as "Γδικιωμός" (Gdikiomos). Many vendettas went on for months, some for years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and, when they got the chance, would murder members of the opposing family. The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} it has led to entire family lines being wiped out. The last vendetta on record required the [[Greek Army]] with [[artillery]] support to force it to a stop. Regardless of this, the Maniot Greeks still practice vendettas even today. Maniots in America, Australia, Canada and [[Corsica]] still have on-going vendettas which have led to the creation of [[Mafia]] families known as "Γδικιωμέοι" (Gdikiomeoi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta |publisher=Mani.org.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}

In [[Corsica]], vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no less than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.&lt;ref&gt;Gregorovius, Ferdinand. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=udhEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Wanderings in Corsica: Its History and Its Heroes]''. (1855). p.&amp;nbsp;196. Retrieved 2015-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] was ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In [[Navarre]], these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In [[Biscay]], the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. (''Cf.'' the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] in Italy). High defensive structures ("towers") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, and sometimes by royal decree.

Leontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the [[Caucasus]], wrote in the mid-19th century: "Among the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|mountain people]] the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion." In the [[Dagestan]]i ''[[aul]]'' of Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/russian-federation/chechen-society-and-mentality |title=Chechen society and mentality |author=Souleimanov, Emil Aslan |work=Prague Watchdog |date=2003-05-25 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ushguli1.JPG|thumb|The defensive towers built by feuding clans of [[Svaneti]], in the [[Caucasus]] mountains]]

The [[Celts|Celtic]] phenomenon of the ''blood feud'' demanded "an eye for an eye," and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between [[clan]]s might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland.

Due to the Celtic heritage of many people living in [[Appalachia]], a series of prolonged violent engagements in late nineteenth-century [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]] were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]], both of whom had written [[historical fiction|semihistorical]] accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]], were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the [[Reconstruction Era]] and the early twentieth century, and are seen by some as linked to a [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|Southern culture of honor]] with its roots in the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] forebears of the residents of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' (2008), Chapter 6, citing, for example, [[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent example is the [[Regulator–Moderator War]], which took place between rival factions in the [[Republic of Texas]]. It is sometimes considered the largest blood feud in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/AllThingsHistorical/The-Worst-Feud-BB1006.htm |title=The Worst Feud |publisher=TexasEscapes.com |author=Bowman, Bob|date=2006-10-15 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to feud was ''[[blood money (term)|blood money]]'' (or ''[[weregild]]'' in the [[Norsemen|Norse]] culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death, even an accidental one. If these payments were not made, or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would ensue.

===Feuds in modern times===
Blood feuds are still practised in some areas in:
* France (especially [[Corsica]] and within [[Sinti|Manush]] communities)
* Ireland (especially [[Dublin]] and [[Limerick]])
* In Northern Ireland between [[Republican movement (Ireland)|Irish republican]] and [[Loyalist|Ulster loyalism]] communities; particularly during [[The Troubles]]
* [[Southern Italy]] (especially [[Sicily]],  [[Campania]], [[Calabria]], [[Apulia]] and other areas of the same territory)&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/police-search-calabrian-village-as-murders-are-linked-to-clan-feud-461917.html Police search Calabrian village as murders are linked to clan feud]", ''The Independent'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226231852/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/police-search-calabrian-village-as-murders-are-linked-to-clan-feud-461917.html |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood feuds within [[Russian people|Russian]] communities do exist (mostly related to criminal gangs), but are neither as common nor as pervasive as they are in the [[Caucasus]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the United States, blood feuds are also not as pervasive or common, but do exist within the [[African-American]] and [[Chicano]] communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGBsoIz8KncC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=chicano+++++feuds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UU_Wayz1N5&amp;sig=KM2jXLtITX1UXZhy59sUKucIXDU&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-oRZUPGwMcm0hAfP_4HICw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chicano%20%20%20%20%20feuds&amp;f=false|title=Chicano Timespace: The Poetry and Politics of Ricardo Sánchez|author=López, Miguel R.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes gang-related, but not necessarily). 
Gang warfare also often takes the form of blood feuds. [[African-Americans|African-American]], [[Khmer people|Cambodian]], [[Cuban people|Cuban]] [[Marielito]], [[Dominican people (Dominican Republic)|Dominican]], [[Guatemalan people|Guatemalan]], [[Haitian people|Haitian]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]], Sino-Vietnamese [[Hoa people|Hoa]], [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]], [[Korean people|Korean]], [[Lao people|Laotian]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[Salvadorans|Salvadoran]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] gang fights in the United States, as well as [[Colombia]]n, [[Mexicans|Mexican]] and [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] gang and paramilitary wars, [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] turf wars in [[South Africa]], [[Dutch Antilleans|Dutch Antillean]], [[Surinamese people|Surinamese]] and [[Moluccans|Moluccan]] gang fights in the [[Netherlands]], and [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[White British]], [[Black British|Black]] and [[Mixed British]] criminal feuds in the [[UK]], very often have taken the form of blood feuds where a family member in the gang is killed and a relative takes revenge by killing the murderer as well as other members of the rival gang. This has resulted in gun violence and murders in cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], [[Ciudad Juarez]], [[Medellin]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Cape Town]], [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], [[Liverpool]], and [[Glasgow]], to name just a few.

Blood feuds also have a long history within the White [[Southern United States|Southern]] population of the U.S., where it is called the "[[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]]", and still exist to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://untpress.unt.edu/catalog/3376|author=Parsons, Chuck|title=The Sutton-Taylor Feud: The Deadliest Blood Feud in Texas|publisher=University of North Texas Press|year=2013|pages=400|accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Albania====
{{main|Gjakmarrja}}
In [[Albania]], ''[[gjakmarrja]]'' (blood feuding) is a tradition. They have returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by [[Enver Hoxha]], and more than 3000 Albanian families are currently engaged in them.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There are now more than 1,600 families who live under an ever-present death sentence because of them, and since 1992, at least 10,000 [[Albanians]] have been killed in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2008/0625/p01s02-woeu.html |title=Peacemaker breaks the ancient grip of Albania's blood feuds |work=The Christian Science Monitor |author=White, Jeffrey|publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood feuds in Albania trace back to the Kanun, this custom is also practiced among the Albanians of Kosovo

A feud may develop into a vicious circle of further [[murder|killings]], retaliation, [[counterattack]]s, and all-out [[war]]fare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====Kosovo====
Blood feuds have also been part of a centuries-old tradition in [[Kosovo]], tracing back to the [[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]], a 15th-century codification of Albanian customary rules. In the early 1990s, most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by [[Anton Çetta]].&lt;ref name="BJC2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjc/azx002/2990197 |title=Did Nonviolent Resistance Fail in Kosovo? |last1=Marsavelski |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Sheremeti |first2=Furtuna |last3=Braithwaite |first3=John |website=British Journal of Criminology |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="BJC2017"/&gt;

====Republic of Ireland====
Criminal gang feuds also exist in [[Dublin]], Ireland and in the Republic's third-largest city, [[Limerick]]. [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] feuds are also common in towns across the country. Feuds can be due to personal issues, money, or disrespect, and grudges can last generations. Since 2001, over 300 people have been killed in feuds between different drugs gangs, [[dissident republican]]s, and [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/garda%C3%AD-suspect-dublin-drug-feud-link-in-double-killing-1.477711 |title=Gardaí suspect Dublin drug feud link in double killing |author=Lally, Conor |work=The Irish Times |publisher=IrishTimes.com |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}

====Philippines====
Family and clan feuds, known locally as ''[[rido]]'', are characterized by sporadic outbursts of retaliatory violence between families and kinship groups, as well as between communities. It can occur in areas where the government or a central authority is weak, as well as in areas where there is a perceived lack of justice and security. ''Rido'' is a [[Maranao language|Maranao]] term commonly used in [[Mindanao]] to refer to clan feuds. It is considered one of the major problems in Mindanao because, apart from numerous casualties, ''rido'' has caused destruction of property, crippled local economies, and displaced families.

Located in the southern Philippines, Mindanao is home to a majority of the country’s Muslim community, and includes the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]]. Mindanao "is a region suffering from poor infrastructure, high poverty, and violence that has claimed the lives of more than 120,000 in the last three decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiafoundation.org/2007/10/31/in-the-philippines-conflict-resolution-in-mindanao/ |title=In the Philippines: Conflict in Mindanao |author=Wilfredo Magno Torres III |accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a widely held stereotype that the violence is perpetrated by armed groups that resort to terrorism to further their political goals, but the actual situation is far more complex. While the Muslim-Christian conflict and the state-rebel conflicts dominate popular perceptions and media attention, a survey commissioned by [[The Asia Foundation]] in 2002 — and further verified by a recent [[Social Weather Stations]] survey — revealed that citizens are more concerned about the prevalence of ''rido'' and its negative impact on their communities than the conflict between the state and rebel groups.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007" /&gt; The unfortunate interaction and subsequent confusion of ''rido''-based violence with [[secession]]ism, [[communist]] [[insurgency]], banditry, military involvement and other forms of armed violence shows that violence in Mindanao is more complicated than what is commonly believed.

''Rido'' has wider implications for conflict in Mindanao, primarily because it tends to interact in unfortunate ways with separatist conflict and other forms of armed violence. Many armed confrontations in the past involving insurgent groups and the military were triggered by a local ''rido''. The studies cited above investigated the dynamics of ''rido'' with the intention of helping design strategic interventions to address such conflicts.

=====Causes=====
The causes of ''rido'' are varied and may be further complicated by a society's concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|honor and shame]], an integral aspect of the social rules that determine accepted practices in the affected communities. The triggers for conflicts range from petty offenses, such as theft and jesting, to more serious crimes, like homicide. These are further aggravated by land disputes and political rivalries, the most common causes of ''rido''. Proliferation of firearms, lack of law enforcement and credible mediators in conflict-prone areas, and an inefficient justice system further contribute to instances of ''rido''.

=====Statistics=====
Studies on ''rido'' have documented a total of 1,266 ''rido'' cases between the 1930s and 2005, which have killed over 5,500 people and displaced thousands. The four provinces with the highest numbers of ''rido'' incidences are: [[Lanao del Sur]] (377), [[Maguindanao]] (218), [[Lanao del Norte]] (164), and [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] (145). Incidences in these four provinces account for 71% of the total documented cases. The findings also show a steady rise in ''rido'' conflicts in the eleven provinces surveyed from the 1980s to 2004. According to the studies, during 2002–2004, 50% (637 cases) of total ''rido'' incidences occurred, equaling about 127 new ''rido'' cases per year. Out of the total number of ''rido'' cases documented, 64% remain unresolved.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Torres, Wilfredo M. (ed) |year=2007 |title=Rido: Clan Feuding and Conflict Management in Mindanao |location=[[Makati]] |publisher=[[The Asia Foundation]] |pages=348 |isbn=978-971-92445-2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Resolution=====
''Rido'' conflicts are either resolved, unresolved, or reoccurring. Although the majority of these cases remain unresolved, there have been many resolutions through different conflict-resolving bodies and mechanisms. These cases can utilize the formal procedures of the Philippine government or the various indigenous systems. Formal methods may involve official courts, local government officials, police, and the military. Indigenous methods to resolve conflicts usually involve elder leaders who use local knowledge, beliefs, and practices, as well as their own personal influence, to help repair and restore damaged relationships. Some cases using this approach involve the payment of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] to resolve the conflict. Hybrid mechanisms include the collaboration of government, religious, and traditional leaders in resolving conflicts through the formation of collaborative groups. Furthermore, the institutionalization of traditional conflict resolution processes into laws and ordinances has been successful with the hybrid method approach. Other conflict-resolution methods include the establishment of ceasefires and the intervention of youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007"/&gt;

Football [[hooliganism]] normally involves conflict between gangs, in English known as football [[List of hooligan firms|firm]]s (the term derives from the British slang for a criminal gang), formed for the purpose of intimidating and physically attacking supporters of other teams. Other English-language terms commonly used in connection with hooligan firms include "army", "boys", "[[Casual (subculture)|casuals]]", and "crew".  Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called [[local derby|local derbies]]) is likely to be more severe.

Conflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from stadiums to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novasports.gr" /&gt; In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and body-armoured [[riot police]] have intervened with [[tear gas]], [[police dogs]], [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] and [[water cannon]]s.&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"/&gt; Hooligan-led violence has been called "aggro" (short for "aggravation") and "bovver" (the [[Cockney]] pronunciation of "bother", i.e. trouble).

Hooligans who have the time and money, may follow national teams to away matches and engage in hooligan behaviour against the hooligans of the home team.  They may also become involved in disorder involving the general public.  While national-level firms do not exist in the form of club-level firms, hooligans supporting the national team may use a collective name indicating their allegiance.

==Behavior==

Football hooliganism involves a wide range of behaviour, including:
* taunting
* spitting
* unarmed fighting

==Early history==
The first instance of football violence is unknown, but the [[phenomenon]] can be traced back to [[History of England#14th century|14th-century England]]. In 1314, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] banned football (at that time, a violent, unruly activity involving rival villages kicking a [[pig's bladder]] across the local [[heath]]) because he believed the disorder surrounding matches might lead to [[Rebellion|social unrest]], or even [[treason]].&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"&gt;{{Cite news|title=When did football hooliganism start?|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 December 2006|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,618130,00.html|accessdate=2007-07-25 | location=London | first=Sean | last=Ingle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[University of Liverpool]] academic [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|paper]], conflict at an 1846 match in [[Derby]], England, required a reading of the "[[riot act]]" and two groups of [[dragoon]]s to effectively respond to the disorderly crowd. This same paper also identified "[[pitch invasion]]s" as a common occurrence during the 1880s in English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html|work=University of Liverpool FIG Factsheet|publisher=Liverpool FC|accessdate=9 May 2012|author=Pearson, G.|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded instances of football hooliganism in the [[History of association football#From amateurism to professionalism|modern game]] allegedly occurred during the 1880s in England, a period when [[gang]]s of supporters would intimidate neighbourhoods, in addition to attacking referees, opposing supporters and players. In 1885, after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 5–0 in a friendly match, both teams were [[wikt:pelt|pelted]] with stones, attacked with sticks, punched, kicked and spat at. One Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness and press reports at the time described the fans as "howling roughs".&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"/&gt; The following year, Preston fans fought [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] fans in a railway station—the first alleged instance of football hooliganism outside of a match. In 1905, a number of Preston fans were [[Trial|tried]] for hooliganism, including a "[[Public intoxication|drunk and disorderly]]" 70-year-old woman, following their match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"/&gt;

Although instances of football crowd violence and disorder have been a feature of association football throughout its history&lt;ref name="Dunning"&gt;Dunning, E, Murphy, P and Williams, J., 'The Roots of Football Hooliganism' 1988, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]'s ground was reportedly closed in 1920, 1934 and 1950 after crowd disturbances), the phenomenon only started to gain the media's attention in the late 1950s due to the re-emergence of violence in [[History of association football#South America|Latin American football]]. In the 1955–56 English football season, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] fans were involved in a number of incidents and, by the 1960s, an average of 25 hooligan incidents were being reported each year in England. The label "football hooliganism" first began to appear in the English media in the mid-1960s,&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Stott, C. and Pearson, G., 'Football Hooliganism: Policing and the War on the English Disease', 2007 London: Pennant Books&lt;/ref&gt; leading to increased media interest in, and reporting of, acts of disorder. It has been argued that this in turn created a 'moral panic' out of proportion with the scale of the actual problem.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, S, 'The Treatment of 'Football Hooligans' in the Press', in Ingham et al., (1978) Football Hooliganism: The Wider Context, London: Inter-Action Inprint&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Football hooliganism has factors in common with juvenile delinquency and what has been called "ritualized male violence".&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Spaaij, Understanding Football Hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Countries&lt;/ref&gt; Sports Studies scholars Paul Gow and Joel Rookwood at [[Liverpool Hope University]] found in a 2008 study that "Involvement in football violence can be explained in relation to a number of factors, relating to interaction, identity, legitimacy and power. Football violence is also thought to reflect expressions of strong emotional ties to a football team, which may help to reinforce a supporter’s sense of identity."&lt;ref name="joelrookwood.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelrookwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Paper-6-Gow-and-Rookwood-Vol-2-2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031101939/http://www.joelrookwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Paper-6-Gow-and-Rookwood-Vol-2-2009.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] one study from 1986 claimed that alcohol, irregular tickets sales,  the disinterest of the organisers and the "'cowardly ineptitude'" of the police had led to the tragedy. Gow and Rookwood's 2008 study, which used interviews with British football hooligans found that while some identified structural social and physiological causes (e.g. aggression produces violent reactions) most interviewees claimed that media reports (especially in newspapers) and the police's handling of hooligan related events were the main causes of hooliganism.&lt;ref name="joelrookwood.com"/&gt; [[Politics|Political]] reasons may also play in part in hooliganism, especially if there is a political undertone to such a match (e.g. unfriendly nations facing each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9176000/9176519.stm|title=Why does football violence happen?|date=10 November 2010|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an attempt to explain the hooliganism phenomena in Brazil, Nepomuceno and other scholars at Federal University of Pernambuco has accessed 1363 hooligan incidents before and after an alcohol sanction enforced during 8 years. While alcohol presented low evidence to contribute for the incidents of violence, the knockout phases, finals, competitiveness (derby matches), small score boundaries and the pride levels were some of the potentials for the violence among sports spectators. Months after the work being conducted, the State Legislature of Pernambuco decided to abolish the sanction to allow alcohol intake in stadiums.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nepomuceno|first=Thyago Celso C.|last2=de Moura|first2=Jadielson Alves|last3=e Silva|first3=Lúcio Câmara|last4=Cabral Seixas Costa|first4=Ana Paula|date=December 2017|title=Alcohol and violent behavior among football spectators: An empirical assessment of Brazilian's criminalization|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlcj.2017.05.001|journal=International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice|volume=51|pages=34–44|doi=10.1016/j.ijlcj.2017.05.001|issn=1756-0616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22158585 |title=BBC Sport – Millwall &amp; Newcastle violence: Who is to blame for football chaos? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bond stated that in the UK, {{quote|text=[h]igh-profile outbreaks of violence involving fans are much rarer today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. The scale of trouble now compared to then doesn't bear comparison – either in terms of the number of people involved or the level of organisation.  Football has moved on thanks to [[ban (law)|banning orders]] and better, more sophisticated policing.
And while it is too simplistic to say that the higher cost of watching football has pushed unsavoury elements out, there has been a shift in the way people are expected to behave inside grounds. Offensive chants are still way too commonplace but actual fighting doesn't happen very often.}}

==Subculture==
Football hooligans often appear to be less interested in the football match than in the associated violence. They often engage in behaviour that risks their being arrested before the match, denied admittance to the stadium, ejected from the stadium during the match or banned from attending future matches. Hooligan groups often associate themselves with, and congregate in, a specific section (called an ''end'' in England) of their team's stadium, and sometimes they include the section's name in the name of their group. In the United Kingdom, 1960s and early 1970s football hooliganism was associated with the [[skinhead]] subculture. Later, the [[casual (subculture)|casual]] subculture transformed the British football hooligan scene. Instead of wearing working class skinhead-style clothes, which readily identified hooligans to the police, hooligans began wearing [[Designer clothing|designer clothes]] and expensive "offhand" [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] (clothing worn without careful attention to practical considerations), particularly [[Stone Island]], [[Prada]], [[Burberry]], [[CP Company]], [[Sergio Tacchini]] and [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FASHION: On the Street; A Rainbow of Raincoats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/style/fashion-on-the-street-a-rainbow-of-raincoats.html|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 April 1989|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-hooligan measures==
Police and civil authorities in various countries with hooligan problems have taken a number of measures, including:
* banning items that could be used as weapons or missiles in stadiums, and searching suspected hooligans
* banning identified hooligans from stadiums, either formally via judicial orders, or informally by denying them admittance on the day
* moving to [[All-seater stadium|all-seated stadiums]], which reduces the risk of disorderly crowd movement
* segregating opposing fans, and fencing enclosures to keep fans away from each other and off the pitch
* banning opposing fans from matches and/or ordering specific matches to be played behind closed doors
* compiling registers of known hooligans
* restricting the ability of known hooligans to travel overseas.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Football hooliganism in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is particularly associated with the supporters of clubs such as [[FK Sarajevo]] ([[Horde Zla]]), [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo]] ([[The Maniacs]]), [[FK Velež Mostar]] ([[Red Army Mostar|Red Army]]), [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar]] (Ultrasi) and [[FK Borac Banja Luka]] (Lešinari).  Other clubs with hooligans as supporters include [[FK Sloboda Tuzla]] (Fukare), [[NK Čelik Zenica]] (Robijaši) and [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (Škripari).

Hooliganism reflects local ethnic divisions and tensions.  Bosniak oriented groups are fans of FK Sarajevo, FK Željezničar and FK Velež Mostar.  Serb oriented groups are fans of FK Borac Banja Luka, [[FK Slavija]], and [[FK Drina Zvornik]] (Vukovi). Croat oriented groups are fans of [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (Škripari) and HŠK Zrinjski Mostar.

Many fans are associated with fascist ideologies, supporting and glorifying extremist movements such as the [[Ustaše]], [[Chetniks]] and [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/ne-nacizmu/46262 |title=Ne nacizmu! |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[2009 NK Široki Brijeg–FK Sarajevo football riots|riots]] between supports of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Premier League]] club sides [[NK Široki Brijeg]] and [[FK Sarajevo]] left [[Horde Zla]] supporter Vedran Puljić (from [[Sarajevo]]) dead from a gunshot wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotonline.com/blog/2009/10/fc-sarajevo-fan-dies-in-riots/ |title=FC Sarajevo fan dies in riots! &amp;#124; Riot terrace fashion blog |publisher=Riotonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooliganism has also been present in lower leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/veliki-neredi-u-jablanici-spasavala-se-ziva-glava/106331 |title=Veliki neredi u Jablanici, spašavala se živa glava |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riots have been common in Jablanica because fans of different clubs tend to meet and clash there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/sprijecen-sukob-navijaca-borca-i-zrinjskog-u-jablanici/104194 |title=Spriječen sukob navijača Borca i Zrinjskog u Jablanici |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
Football hooliganism in [[Croatia]] has seen riots over inter-ethnic resentments and the politics that were reignited by the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Day Yugoslav Soccer Died |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/football-war.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the best known [[List of hooligan firms|hooligan firms]] are [[Torcida Split|Torcida]] ([[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]) and [[Bad Blue Boys]] ([[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]).&lt;ref name="soccerphile002"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Ultra Scene in Croatia and Serbia: Football Hooliganism Balkan Style |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/hooligans.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the groups are not just hooligan firms; they are more like the South American [[Torcida]] supporters groups and [[Ultras]] groups, with organised [[Tifo]]s and so on.

On 13 May 1990 (before the breakup of Yugoslavia) Serbian club [[Red Star Belgrade]] was in [[Zagreb]] to play [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] at the [[Maksimir Stadium]]. Red Star was accompanied by 3000 Delije, the organized supporters of the club. Before the match a number of small fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] and [[water cannon]]s, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo's player [[Zvonimir Boban]] kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo's fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured. Football hooliganism in Croatia is sometimes connected with racism and nationalism,&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"/&gt; although the racist remarks, if any appear, are pointed solely to opposing club's players, never to own squad.

Ethnic tension between Croats and Serbs has also led to fighting at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, [[Sydney United FC|Sydney United]] (who have a large Croatian following, and were established by Croatian immigrants) and [[Bonnyrigg White Eagles Football Club|Bonnyrigg White Eagles]] (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the [[New South Wales Premier League]]. About 50 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. [[Football NSW]] held an inquiry into the events. Both clubs denied that the fight was racially motivated or that there was any ethnic rivalry.&lt;ref name="SMH050314"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Football riot's stupidity, not ethnic, say clubs|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=14 March 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Football/Football-riots-stupidity-not-ethnic-say-clubs/2005/03/14/1110649117701.html|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
P
Croatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where signal flares and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw signal flares at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police.

Another incident occurred in [[Genoa]] in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting continued in the stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made [[nazi]] salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in [[Osijek]] during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and [[Kohorta Osijek|Kohorta]] occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with signal flares and stones.

A large riot occurred in 2008 in [[Prague]] prior to the [[Sparta Prague]]-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited with the support of Sparta's ultrafans to Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}[http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/bbb-se-susrecu-s-ljubiteljima-karadzica-i-mladica-kojima-ogradu-krasi-srpska-zastava/400226.aspx Index.hr] BBB se susreću s ljubiteljima Karadžića i Mladića, 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- just see the pictures --&gt; Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre breaking shops and attacking police with chairs, signal flares and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and 8 police officer were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local [[Romani people]] by giving [[nazi]] salutes.

A large riot occurred in 2010 on 1.May at the [[Maksimir stadium]] when the Bad Blue Boys clashed with the police resulting in many arrests and one critically injured police officer. After the match violent clashes continued in which one Dinamo fan was shot by police officers. A large incident occurred in 2009 prior to the [[FC Timişoara]]-Dinamo match. 400 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre and attacked local people. After the incident [[Romanians|Romanian]] police detained a large number of Dinamo fans but the situation escalated again at the [[FC Timişoara]] stadium when 200 Bad Blue Boys tore down the pitch fence and attacked the police with chairs and bats resulting in several injured police officers. During the clash Dinamo fans fired signal missiles at [[FC Timişoara]] fans resulting in severe injuries.
Many [[Croats|Croatian]] hooligan groups have also displayed [[nazi]] flags at matches and have [[neo-nazi]] [[skinheads]] in their ranks. Several incidents occurred when Bad Blue Boys and Torcida made racist chants towards opposing club's football players of [[Black people|African]]&lt;!-- Charlize Theron and Richard Gibson are also of African descent --&gt; descent and hurled bananas in the pitch. In 2010, a [[Cameroon]] player was attacked in [[Koprivnica]] resulting in severe injuries.

In December 2010. 10–15 Tornado ([[Zadar]]) hooligans attacked a [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] traveling coach with stones and bricks resulting in one injured person. In December 2010 30–40 [[Bad Blue Boys]] attacked a [[PAOK]] traveling coach with stones, bricks and flares setting the traveling coach on fire and inflicting injuries on several passengers.

In November 2014, during a [[Euro 2016]] qualifying game in [[Milan, Italy]] hooligans from Croatia threw flares and fireworks onto the field and the game had to be briefly suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2836967/Italy-1-1-Croatia-European-Championship-qualifier-suspended-10-minutes-second-half.html|title=Italy 1-1 Croatia: European Championship qualifier suspended for 10 minutes in second-half - Daily Mail Online|date=16 November 2014|work=Mail Online|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
Football hooliganism in Cyprus has been an issue for the past few decades and incidents are generally associated with the 5 major Cypriot clubs.

[[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]] fans have been in involved in many incidents on most occasions involving their ultras group "Mahites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/103398/epeisodia-ston-petosfairiko-agona-anagennisi-anorthosi|title=Επεισόδια στον πετοσφαιρικό αγώνα Αναγέννηση- Ανόρθωση|author=sigmalive/ΚΥΠΕ|date=22 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two clubs in Limassol, [[AEL Limassol]] and [[Apollon Limassol]] have also been involved in numerous incidents, especially in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbeast.gr/sports/arthro/680998/epeisodia-amaurosan-to-derbi-ael-apoel/|title=Επεισόδια αμαύρωσαν το ντέρμπι ΑΕΛ-ΑΠΟΕΛ|work=Newsbeast.gr|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/153504/krisimos-travmatismos-nearou-sto-filiko-anorthosi-apollon|title=Κρίσιμος τραυματισμός νεαρού στο φιλικό Ανόρθωση-Απόλλων|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2013/11/03/treis-syllhceis-gia-ta-epeisodia-ston-ag/|title=ANT1 internet world - Τρεις συλλήψεις για τα επεισόδια στον αγώνα Απόλλων - ΑΠΟΕΛ|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of [[APOEL FC]] and [[AC Omonia Nicosia]], the two most successful and most popular clubs in the country are notorious for hooliganism. The most violent cases of hooliganism in Cyprus usually involve the two teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/200575/ektetamena-epeisodia-exo-apo-to-oikima-tou-apoel|title=Εκτεταμένα επεισόδια έξω από το οίκημα του ΑΠΟΕΛ|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/Cyprus/epeisodia-sthn-kupro.2792956.html|title=Επεισόδια και διακοπή στο ΑΕΛ - ΑΠΟΕΛ|author=Φώντας Σέμπρος|date=17 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2012/05/17/skhniko-polemoy-sth-lemeso-videos/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/multimedia/video/anorthwsh-omonoia-epeisodia.1977896.html|title=Ανόρθωση - Ομόνοια (επεισόδια)|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 APOEL fans entered the Omonia stand and engaged in fistfights with Omonia fans eventually throwing one down the stand stairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=42915|title=Σοβαρά επεισόδια και διακοπή του ντέρμπι ΑΠΟΕΛ-Ομόνοια|work=Ελευθεροτυπία|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 months later in November fans of the two teams clashed close to the [[GSP Stadium]] when APOEL fans tried to hijack a futsal tournament organized by Omonia.

The rivalry between Omonia and APOEL has its roots in politics. APOEL fans are in their majority right wing whereas Omonia fans are left wing. Communist symbols in the Omonia stand and right wing or even fascist symbols in the APOEL stand are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftwingsoccer.com/politics-of-cypriot-football/|title=Left-Wing Soccer – Understanding the Political Divide in Cypriot Football|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limassol rivalry between Apollon and AEL Limassol is more a matter of what team dominates over the city.&lt;ref name="free-project.eu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.free-project.eu/documents-free/Working%20Papers/Performing%20Fan%20Identities%20Role%20Politics%20Antagonistic%20Communication%20Football%20Fans%20Cyprus%20%28S%20Stylianou%20V%20Theodoropoulou%29.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623144937/http://www.free-project.eu/documents-free/Working%20Papers/Performing%20Fan%20Identities%20Role%20Politics%20Antagonistic%20Communication%20Football%20Fans%20Cyprus%20%28S%20Stylianou%20V%20Theodoropoulou%29.pdf |archive-date=23 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooliganism in the case of Anorthosis is also politically linked, especially when the club plays a left wing team such as Omonia. Other incidents between clubs of different cities that are of the same political orientation are associated with intercity rivalries, particularly when a club from Limassol faces a club from Nicosia.&lt;ref name="free-project.eu"/&gt;

===France===

Football hooliganism in France is often rooted in [[social conflict]], including racial tension. In the 1990s, fans of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG) fought with supporters from Belgium, England, Germany, Italy and Scotland.&lt;ref name = "Bay"&gt;{{Cite news| title =Racist insults infiltrate French soccer stadium|url =http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm | publisher =[[The Boston Bay State Banner]]| date= 20 April 2006 | accessdate = 2006-10-21|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060715011039/http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm |archivedate = 15 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long-standing north/south rivalry between PSG (representing Paris and by extension northern France) and [[Olympique de Marseille]] (representing the South of France) which has encouraged authorities to be extremely mobilised during games between the two teams. Violent fights and post-game riots including car burning, and shop windows smashing have been a regular fixture of PSG-OM games. In 2000, the bitter rivalry turned particularly violent.&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;{{Cite news| title = PSG act after fan hurt

On 24 May 2001, fifty people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between PSG and Turkish club [[Galatasaray S.K.

On 24 November 2006 a PSG fan was shot and killed by police and another seriously injured during fighting between PSG fans and the police. The violence occurred after PSG lost 4–2 to [[Israeli people|Israeli]] club [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] at the Parc des Prince in a [[UEFA Cup]] match. PSG fans chased a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv, shouting racist and anti-semitic slogans. A plainclothes police officer who tried to protect the Hapoel fan was attacked, and in the chaos, one fan was shot dead and another seriously injured. In response, the French Interior Minister, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] held a meeting with the president of the French Football League, Frederic Thiriez to discuss racism and violence in football. The director-general of the French police, Michel Gaudin, insisted that measures against football hooliganism had reduced racist incidents to six that season from nineteen in the previous season. Gaudin also stated that 300 known hooligans could be banned from matches.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{Cite news| title = France faces up to football hooliganism |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6189888.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 27 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-29 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fan who was shot, was linked with the ''Boulogne Boys'', a group of fans who modelled themselves on British hooligans in the 1980s. The group's name comes from the [[Kop of Boulogne]] (KOB), one of the two main home fan stand at the Parc des Princes.

The KOB themselves held a silent memorial march attended by 300 and accused the police office of murdering the fan. They cited bias in the French press who had only given a "one-sided" account of the incident.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt; French President [[Jacques Chirac]] condemned violence that led up to the shooting, stating that he was horrified by the reports of racism and anti-Semitism. French Prime Minister, [[Dominique de Villepin]] called for new, tougher measures to deal with football hooligans. Prosecutors opened an inquiry into the incident, to determine whether the officer involved should face criminal charges.&lt;ref name="BBC5"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Chirac condemns football violence |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6182414.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 25 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC6"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Paris fan shot dead by policeman |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6179418.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 24 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0408-011, FC Carl Zeiss Jena - FC Berlin, Ausschreitungen.jpg|thumb|right |German football hooligans with masked faces in a 1990s match.]]Before a home match against [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]] on 4 January 2006, two [[Arab]] youths were punched and kicked by [[white people|white]] fans outside the entrance to the KOB. During the match racist insults were aimed at black players and a PSG player of [[Demographics of India|Indian]] origin, [[Vikash Dhorasoo]] was told to "go sell peanuts in the metro".&lt;ref name="Bay" /&gt; In the recent years, following UK's example, France's legislation has changed, including more and more banning of violent fans from stadiums. The threat of dissolution of fan groups has also tempered the outward rivalry and violence of a number of fans. Known violent fans under ban sentences are to report to the nearest Police station on nights of game, to prove they are not anywhere in proximity to the stadium.

On 11 June 2016, during a Euro 2016 match in [[Marseille]] between Russia and England, violent conflict broke out between the fans and left 35 injured. Both threw numerous items at each other and engaged in physical combat. Even a person who is recording the incident can be seen stomping another person's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/new-gopro-style-footage-shows-fan-violence-first-hand/|title=Incredible GoPro-style footage from Russian fan shows Euro 2016 violence with England supporters first-hand|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, both countries were given a disqualification warning soon later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36510550|title=Euro 2016: England and Russia given disqualification warning - BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended with 1-1.

===Greece===
[[File:Panathinaikos-paok 1989.jpg|thumb|Hooligans of "GATE 13" Panathinaiko's attacking supporters of "GATE 4" Paok and punched in field of Leoforos Alexandras stadium.]]
The first incidents between Football fans in Greece were recorded in June 1930, after the match between [[Aris Thessaloniki]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] at Thessaloniki. While Panathinaikos fans where arriving at the port of [[Piraeus]] from [[Thessaloniki]], Olympiakos fans, who had not forgotten the big loss of their team (8–2) by [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] rioted with the green fans. 
The word "hooliganism" was recorded at the early '60s where Greek students in the UK who had experienced the phenomenon of hooliganism there first taught the term to the journalists who were unable to explain why the fans were fighting each other and gave this situation a name.
In 1962, after [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] and [[P.A.O.K. F.C.]] match incidents, newspapers wrote for the first time that hooligans (Χούλιγκανς) vandalized [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]].
It was on 19 November 1966 that a big flag, at the 13th gate of [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]] announced the arrival of a new group on the scene. [[Gate 13]] would be the first organized group that over the years became a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all possible occasions.
[[P.A.O.K. F.C.]] fans made Gate 4 in 1978 and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] fans create the Gate 7 in 1981.
In 1982, between Aris FC – Paok FC match incidents, Aris Dimitriadis was stabbed and later died in Thessaloniki's hospital. On 26 October 1986, at the Alkazar stadium of Larissa Charalambos Blionas was killed by a flare pistol thrown by the Paok fans. One month later anastasios Zontos was stabbed to death in Omonoia square in the center of Athens before the match [[AEK Athens F.C.]] &amp; [[P.A.O.K. F.C.]]. In January 1991, before the derby of Aek F.C. and Olympiakos F.C., George Panagiotou died in the incidents between hooligans outside Nea Filadelfia's stadium hit by flare pistol.
On 15 May 2005, in [[Thessaloniki]] derby [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]]-[[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris F.C.]], Aris' hooligans called ''Ierolohites'' invaded the pitch when the score was 2–1 for Iraklis. A football player Tasos Katsambis was injured during the clashes. The match was halted and [[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris]] was punished with a 4-point deduction which led to their relegation to the [[Second Division (Greece)|Second Division]].
In April 2007, all sports stadiums were closed down in [[Greece]] for two weeks following the death of a fan in a pre-arranged fight between hooligans in [[Athens]] on 29 March. The fight involved 500 fans of rival [[Super League Greece]] clubs [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], which is based in Athens, and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], which is based in nearby [[Piraeus]]. The [[Politics of Greece|Greek government]] immediately suspended all team sports in Greece and severed the ties between teams and their supporters' organizations.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kitsantonis | first = Niki | title = Soccer: Greece wrestles with fan violence| work=International Herald Tribune | date = 19 April 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/19/sports/GREEKS.php | accessdate = 2007-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match between [[Panetolikos]] and [[Ilioupoli GS|Ilioupoli]] was stopped for thirty minutes when players and fans clashed following a Panetolikos disallowed goal.

On 18 April, rival fans clashed with each other and riot police in [[Ioannina]] during and after a [[Greek football Cup|Greek Cup]] semi-final match between local rivals [[PAS Giannena]] and [[AEL 1964|Larissa]]. There was trouble during the game in which Larissa won 2–0. Fans set fire to [[Waste container|rubbish bins]] and smashed shop windows, while police tried to disperse them by firing tear gas.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novasports.gr" /&gt;

On 10 October 2009, a group of about 30 hooligans disrupted an "Under 17" match between local rivals PAOK and [[Aris Thessaloniki]]. Among the injured were a group of Aris Thessaloniki players and their coach, a veteran PAOK player and another official. On 7 October 2011, a group of Greek supporters firebombed the away section of a Euro 2012 qualifying match against Croatia in Athens.
On 18 March 2012, during the match for the Super League Greek Championship in Athens Olympic Stadium between Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, home team Panathinaikos's fans who were inside the stadium attacked police forces with Molotov bombs, causing extended damages to the stadium, while police forces were unable to keep peace.

On 5 January 2014, in [[Aigaleo]], a suburb in [[Athens]], the local team [[Aigaleo FC]] was hosting [[AEK Athens]], a [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match. Before the match clashes broke up between [[AEK Athens|AEK]] and [[Aigaleo FC|Aigaleo]] fans. Indeed, the clashes resulted in the arrest of a security guard of the stadium who was accused of participating in the clashes among [[Aigaleo]] hooligans and also accused of committing attempted murder against an [[AEK Athens|AEK]] fan.

On 15 September 2014, in [[Nea Alikarnassos]], the team Herodotus&lt;ref&gt;[[:el:Π.Α.Σ.Α. Ηρόδοτος]]&lt;/ref&gt; was hosting [[Ethnikos Piraeus]] , a [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match. On 75' minute of the game, a clash between the supporters of the two clubs forced the referee to stop the match.

===Montenegro===
In a [[Euro 2016]] qualifying match in [[Podgorica]] on 27 March 2015, a few seconds in, a hooligan threw a flare at Russia goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]] injuring him. The match was then temporarily suspended.

===Poland===
{{further|Football hooliganism in Poland}}

One of the biggest riots occurred at a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA – Group 2)|World Cup qualifying match]] between Poland and England on 29 May 1993 in [[Chorzów]].

Arranged football hooligan fights in Poland are known as ''[[wikt:ustawka|ustawki]]''; they became common in Poland since the late 90s. On 30 March 2003, [[Polish police]] arrested 120 people after rival football supporters fought during a match between [[Śląsk Wrocław]] and [[Arka Gdynia]].&lt;ref name="BBC2901451"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Man killed in Polish football riot | publisher = BBC News | date = 30 March 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2901451.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wrocław football riot 2003|riot]], [[hooliganism|hooligans]] pelted police officers with stones and fought a running battle with knives and axes. One victim was seriously injured and later died in hospital.

During the [[UEFA Cup 1998-99|1998–99 UEFA Cup]], a knife was thrown at Italian footballer [[Dino Baggio]], from [[Parma F.C.]] by Polish supporters (allegedly [[Wisła Kraków]] fans), injuring his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igol.pl/article,3402.html |title=W krainie latających noży |publisher=Igol.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430181126/http://www.igol.pl/article,3402.html |archive-date=30 April 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of [[Legia Warszawa]] also attracted negative attention after in Lithuania during the match against [[Vetra Vilnius]] on 10 July 2007.

The most notable hooligan incidents happened in [[Kraków]] where supporters of the [[Wisła Kraków]] and [[KS Cracovia]] teams have a rivalry that reportedly extended to killings of opposing fans.

Country-wide riots involving football fans were seen in [[Słupsk street riots 1998|1998 in Słupsk]] and [[Knurów riots 2015|2015 in Knurów]], both incidents sparked by a killing of a fan by the police.

===Republic Of Ireland===
Football Hooliganism was never an issue in Ireland up until the early 2000s and involved many pre match fights began to spawn in areas such as County Louth, Dublin and Derry. The behaviour of fans in these areas involved fights, racist chants and banners and many different pyrotechnic tools such as flares, smoke bombs and strobes. Often enough the away team and League of Ireland matches would be ganged up on by the home teams and attacked.
===Russia===
[[File:Hooligans of Spartak Moscow 1.jpg|thumb |Hooligans of [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]]]

Football hooliganism has become prevalent in Russia since the beginning of the 2000s, Hooligans are associated with teams such as [[FC Spartak Moscow]] (Gladiators, Shkola, Union), [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] (Red-Green's, Vikings, BHZ, Trains Team), [[PFC CSKA Moscow]] (RBW, Gallant Steeds, Yaroslavka, Einfach Jugend), [[FC Dynamo Moscow]] (Capitals, 9-ka), [[FC Torpedo Moscow]] (Tubes, TroubleMakers) – all from Moscow – and [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg]] (Music Hall, Coalition, Snakes Firm) from [[Saint Petersburg]].

===Serbia===
The most prominent groups of hooligans are associated with [[Belgrade]] and [[Serbia]]'s two main clubs, [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]]. They are known as the ''[[Delije]]'' ("Heroes") and ''[[Grobari]]'' ("Gravediggers"), respectively. [[FK Rad]] is a less-successful Belgrade club, whose associated hooligans, known locally as "''United Force''", have notoriously been involved in many violent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1123137,00.html |title=The Observer: Football, blood and war |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2007, a plainclothes police officer was seriously injured when he was attacked during a [[Serbian Superliga]] match between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Hajduk Kula|Hajduk Kula]].&lt;ref&gt;The officer was attacked with burning flares and broken seats and he had to fire warning shots in the air in self-defence. He was treated for burns, cuts and bruises in a nearby hospital. The following day, the [[Football Association of Serbia]] requested government help to help crack down on football hooliganism in the country.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersidUKL0320214820071203"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Milosavljevic| first = Zoran| title = Soccer-Serbian government to take tougher stance on hooligans| publisher = Reuters | date = 13 December 2007 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL0320214820071203 | accessdate = 2007-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2008 a football fan was killed near [[Novi Sad]] after clashes between [[FK Partizan]]'s [[Grobari]] and fans of [[FK Vojvodina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL1686240920080416 |title=Soccer-Serbian FA issues anti-hooliganism appeal |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same week, after a Red Star Belgrade-Partizan cup match, three people were injured and a bus destroyed by hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=294429 |title=Vesti – Nova divljanja huligana – Internet, Radio i TV stanica; najnovije vesti iz Srbije |publisher=B92 |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Football [[hooliganism]] in Spain arises from three main sources. The first is racism, as some [[black people|black]] players have been victims of [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]]. [[Samuel Eto'o]], a former [[FC Barcelona]] player from [[Cameroon]], has denounced the problem.

The second source is the strong [[Major football rivalries|rivalry]] between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. After transferring from Barcelona to Real Madrid, [[Luís Figo]]'s appearance in Barcelona's [[Camp Nou|Nou Camp]] Stadium triggered a strong reaction. The crowd threw bottles, mobile phones and other things (including a pig's head). Although nobody was injured the match was followed by a large discussion on fan violence in the Spanish [[La Liga|Primera División]].

Hooliganism is also rooted in deep political divisions arising from the [[General Franco]] fascist regime days (some [[Real Madrid]], [[Atlético Madrid]], [[Espanyol]], [[Real Betis Balompie]] or [[Valencia CF]] ultras are linked to franquista groups), the communist ones, (such as [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]], [[Athletic Club Bilbao]], [[Sevilla FC]], [[Celta de Vigo]], [[Rayo Vallecano]]) and the independentist movements in [[Catalonia]] (like [[FC Barcelona]]), [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] region. In Spain, organized hooligan groups are popularly called ''grupos ultra''. Three notorious ones are the [[Boixos Nois]], the Frente Atlético and the Ultras Sur, supporter groups of FC Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid respectively.

In 1991, [[Frederiq Roiquier]], a French supporter of [[Espanyol de Barcelona]] was killed by [[FC Barcelona]] hooligans which mistook him for an Espanyol hooligan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1991/01/30/deportes/665190001_850215.html |title=Un 'ultra' azulgrana afirma que la muerte de un joven francés fue rigurosamente planeada &amp;#124; Edición impresa &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Elpais.com |date=30 January 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 a 13-year-old child died in [[Espanyol]] stadium before a flare impact in his thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-65085 |title=MURIÓ UN NIÑO POR BENGALA EN ESPAÑA – Archivo – Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 |publisher=eltiempo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Aitor Zabaleta, a supporter of [[Real Sociedad]] was killed by an [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/247076/l/ |title=El Tribunal Supremo confirma la pena por desórdenes contra Ricardo Guerra y otros miembros del grupo ultra Bastión |trans-title=The Supreme Court confirmed the sentence for disorderly conduct against Ricardo Guerra and other group members ultra Bastión |language=Spanish |publisher=20 Minutos |date=13 June 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was linked to a neo-Nazi group (Bastión), just before a match between these two teams. In 2003, a supporter of [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]] was killed in riots by Deportivo hooligans, when he tried to protect a supporter of the opposing team, [[SD Compostela]]. Since then, authorities have made attempts to bring hooliganism more under control. In 2007, there were acts of hooliganism before a match between Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, with several cars being destroyed and policemen injured by flares and bottles which were thrown at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Vandal incidents in Madrid|url =http://www.elcomerciodigital.com/prensa/20070225/deportes/vandalismo-frente-atletico_20070225.html | publisher =[[El Correo Digital]]| date= 24 February 2007| accessdate = 2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many black foreign players have been racially abused, such as at a 2004 friendly match between Spain and England, in which black England players such as [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] and [[Ashley Cole]] endured [[monkey chants]] from Spain supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/monkey-chants-force-clampdown-on-spains-racist-football-fans-525020.html |title='Monkey chants' force clampdown on Spain's racist football fans – Europe, World |publisher=The Independent |date=29 January 2006 |accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London | first=Graham | last=Keeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also have been local disputes between rival teams, for example between [[Cádiz Club de Fútbol]] and [[Xerez CD]], [[Real Betis Balompie]] and [[Sevilla FC]] or [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] and [[Celta de Vigo]].

Hooligan violence in Spain decreased since the late '90s due to an alcohol ban in sporting events as well as hooligan laws which attempt fines up to 600,000 euros and bans of two years without access to stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/informacion/legislacion-basica/ley-del-deporte |title=Ley del Deporte – Portal del Consejo Superior de Deportes |language=es |publisher=Csd.gob.es |date=1 January 2000 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 [[FC Barcelona]] hooligans, the [[Boixos Nois]] are not allowed to enter in [[Camp Nou]]. The hardcore of Barcelona hooligans subgroups were involved in police operations against organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/20100919/casuals-una-mafia-catalana/486250.shtml |title=Casuals, una mafia catalana – Sociedad – El Periódico |publisher=Elperiodico.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, after a hooligan incident versus [[Espanyol]], [[FC Barcelona]] very publicly took a stand on violence, saying it hoped to stamp out violence for good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada08-09/09/n080928105461.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801194615/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada08-09/09/n080928105461.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 August 2012 |title=FCBarcelona.cat |publisher=FCBarcelona.cat |date=28 September 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligans clashed with Aberdeen FC hooligans prior to a [[UEFA Cup]] match.In 2009 and 2010 [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligans also clashed with [[FC Porto]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] in Portugal during [[UEFA Cup]] games.
In 2012 a [[Rayo Vallecano]] Hooligan was arrested during riots in 14-November general strike and accused of terrorism.

In 2014, debate about eradicating Spanish hooligans arose after Frente Atlético members murdered a Riazor Blues member, [[Deportivo La Coruña]] radicals; and after members of the [[Boixos Nois]] stabbed two [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] supporters in Barcelona.

In 2016, Football-related violence came once again to the public debate after a Fight between [[Sevilla FC]] and [[Juventus FC]] Supporters that occurred the day before their [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage match. 2 Juventus supporters were stabbed (one of them was seriously injured but survived after being hospitalized) and a Sevilla supporter was hospitalized with head wounds caused by a glass bottle.

===Sweden===
Hooliganism began in Sweden at the turn of the 20th century as fans of [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] and [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] have been reported fighting after derbies in [[Stockholm]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Modern hooliganism began in 1970 when fans of [[IFK Göteborg]] invaded the pitch, destroyed the goalposts and fought the police at the end of a match that relegated Göteborg from the [[Allsvenskan]], although Hooliganism in Sweden became a growing problem in the 1980s, but [[pitch invasion]]s and violence at football grounds decreased in the late 1990s; when hooligan firms started pre-arranging their fights away from the grounds and the regular supporters. Seven clubs that have large organised hooligans firms are [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] (Firman Boys), [[IFK Göteborg]] (Wisemen) [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]] (DFG) [[Hammarby IF]] (KGB) [[Malmö FF]] (True Rockers) [[GAIS]] (Gärningsmännen) and [[Helsingborgs IF]] (Frontline). But several other football, bandy and ice hockey clubs have active hooligan followings.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news| title =First Swedish football death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2169007.stm | publisher =BBC News| date= 2 August 2002 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, 12 members of the Wisemen stood trial for inflicting life-threatening injuries on a [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] fan in 2001.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In August 2002, [[Tony Deogan]], a member of the Wisemen, was killed after a pre-arranged fight against Firman Boys.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; A second fatality occurred in March 2014, when a 43-year-old [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] supporter was killed in [[Helsingborg]] in an assault on his way to Djurgården's opening match in the [[2014 Allsvenskan]] against [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborg]].

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, hooligan incidents are rare due to the fact that the stadiums are small and teams are little.

One incident, dubbed the [[2006 Basel Hooligan Incident]], 13 May 2006, occurred on the last day of the 2005–06 season, when [[FC Zürich]] defeated [[FC Basel]] at [[St. Jakob Park]] to win the Swiss championship with a last-minute goal. After the final whistle, angry Basel hooligans stormed the field and attacked Zürich players. The Zürich team were forced to celebrate in the upper deck of the stands while the fighting continued. There was similar fighting in the streets that night.&lt;ref name="nzz.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/2006/11/23/eng/article7274780.html |accessdate=6 December 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzz.ch"/&gt;

===Turkey===

According to the ''[[Turkish Daily News]]'', hooligan groups are well organised, have their own "leaders", and often consist of organised [[street fighting|street fighters]]. These groups have a "racon" (code of conduct), which states that the intention must be to [[injury|injure]] rather than [[murder|kill]] and that a stab must be made below the waist.&lt;ref name="fatalmistakes"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Chain of Fatal Mistakes | url = http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/h.php?news=chain-of-fatal-mistakes-2000-04-16 | publisher = [[Turkish Daily News]]| date = 16 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hooligans have fired firearms into the air to celebrate their team's victory, which has been known to accidentally kill innocent people watching the celebrations on their balconies.&lt;ref name="passionofturks"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Passion of Turkish fans| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/704374.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 6 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="givingperspective"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Giving perspective to football violence| url = http://www.soccernet.com/euro2000/columns/20000521featmike.html| publisher = [[Soccernet]]| date = 20 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trouble has arisen during matches between Istanbul rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe.&lt;ref name="passionofturks" /&gt; However, the [[Turkish Football Federation]] has tightened security to try and contain the hooliganism.

{{Main|Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom}}

There are records of football hooliganism in the UK from the 1880s, and from no later than the 1960s the UK had a worldwide reputation for it&amp;nbsp;– the phenomenon was often dubbed the ''English Disease''.&lt;ref name="LiverpoolUni"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html | title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM | accessdate=20 March 2011 | publisher=Football Industry Group, University of Liverpool}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title='Football Hooliganism: Policing the War on the English Disease' | author=Stott, Clifford | year=2007 | publisher=Pennant Books | isbn=978-1-906015-05-3 | author2=Pearson, Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EnglishDiseaseBBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6532989.stm | title=The return of the English disease? | accessdate=20 March 2011 | date=6 April 2007 | publisher=BBC | first=Mario | last=Cacciottolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndyEnglishDisease"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/another-sorry-outbreak-of-the-english-disease-730590.html | title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease | accessdate=20 March 2011 | date=17 June 2004 | publisher=The Independent on Sunday | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s, many organised hooligan firms sprang up, with most [[Football League]] clubs having at least one known organised hooligan element. Hooliganism was often as its worst when local rivals played each other. Supporters of teams including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Leicester City]] and 
[[Bristol City]] were among those most frequently linked to hooliganism.

Racism became a major factor in hooliganism around the same time, as black players became a regular feature in English league teams from the 1970s. Black players were frequently targeted with monkey chants, and had bananas thrown at them. Members of far-right groups including the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] also sprayed racist slogans and distributed racist literature at matches.

[[Sectarian]] violence has long been a regular factor of crowd violence, as well as offensive chanting, at matches in [[Scotland]] between [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

As a result of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] at [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in [[1985 European Cup Final|1985]], where Liverpool FC fans rioting led to the death of 39 [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] fans, English clubs were banned from all European competitions until 1990, with Liverpool (the English team present) banned for an additional year.&lt;ref name="hillsboroughjustice"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Michael Moore's Bowling For Columbine and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign | url = http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/bowling.shtm | publisher = Hillsborough Justice Campaign | accessdate = 2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Manchester United hooligan Colin Blaney in his autobiography 'The Undesirables', many of the football hooligan gangs in the UK used hooliganism as a cover for acquisitive forms of crime, specifically theft and burglary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Blaney |title=Undesirables |year=2014 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1782198970 |pages=1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been confirmed in numerous other articles on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Chester |title=Getting Life Lessons From Manchester's Jet-Setting Career Thieves |publisher=Vice Media |date=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=J. |last=Sugden |title=Inside the Grafters' Game: An Ethnographic Examination of Football's Underground Economy |publisher=Journal of Sport and Social Issues |date=January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government led a major crackdown on football-related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations including pubs rather than at the matches themselves.

English clubs who have made the headlines for the worst and most frequent cases of hooliganism include Birmingham City (whose multi racial hooligan element gained the nickname "Zulus" from fans of rival teams in the 1970s when football hooligans were almost always white British), Chelsea (whose then chairman [[Ken Bates]] installed an electric fence at the club's stadium in the mid 1980s to combat hooligans, but was refused permission to switch it on during matches), Leeds United (who were banned from European competitions following a riot after the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern München), Liverpool (14 of whose fans were convicted after a riot at the 1985 European Cup final resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators at Heysel Stadium in [[Belgium]] when a stadium wall collapsed, leading to English clubs being banned from European competitions for 5 years), Manchester United (who were booted out of the European Cup Winner's Cup in 1977 after their fans rioted at a game in France, although they were reinstated to the competition on appeal), Millwall (whose most notorious hooliganism incident was in 1985 when their fans rioted in an FA Cup tie at [[Luton]]), Tottenham Hotspur who gained notoriety for the 1974 UEFA Cup Final disturbances and again in Rotterdam in 1983 (who had a section of fans banned from all football grounds in England in 2008 for their racial and homophobic abuse of former player [[Sol Campbell]]) and Wolves (who had dozens of fans convicted of incidents in the late 1980s involving the [[Subway Army]] hooligan firm at matches against teams including Cardiff City and Scarborough when they were in the Fourth Division).

=== Ukraine ===
Football [[hooliganism]] movement in [[Ukraine]] started in the 1980s. The first big fight (more than 800 people) involving football hooligans was registered in September 1987 between [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] fans in the center of [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusplt.ru/society/okolofutbol-evromaydan-7827.html|title=Родом из советского околофутбола|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s passed in relative silence, as there were no big fights between hooligans. The origin of the football hooligan movement in Ukraine started in the mid-90s. On September 5, 1998 an important game between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Russia national football team|Russia]]'s national football teams was played. Ukrainian hooligans began to unite in "National crews" to resist Russian fans. However, the mass union did not take place due to police intervention and were mainly composed of Ukrainian fans from [[Kiev]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. In March 2001, several crews united and attacked 80 [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] fans after match between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Belarus national football team|Belarus national football]] teams. At that exact time hooligans and ultras were separated, due to changes of views on supporting movement. One part decided to dedicate all time at the tribune to create a choreo in Italian style, and the others decided to remain faithful to English style with fighting and the same wear style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dynamo.kiev.ua/blog/91566-istoriya-i-natsionalnyie-osobennosti-fanatskogo-dvizheniya-ukrainyi-i-rossii|title=История и национальные особенности фанатского движения Украины и России|author=dynamo.kiev.ua|work=Новини Динамо К|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 April 2002 about 50 right Dynamo fans attacked [[Jewish]] quarter in [[Kiev]]. First, they stoned small shop and after that throw stoned in synagogue and beat up the head of synagogue and other believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rus.delfi.ee/archive/v-kieve-skinhedy-razgromili-sinagogu?id=3452154|title=В Киеве скинхеды разгромили синагогу|author=rus.delfi.ee|work=rus.delfi.ee|accessdate=15 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 clashes between hooligans occurred mostly outside the city because of the excessive attention of police. During the [[Euro 2012]] several leaders of football hooligans came under government pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9316682/Dont-judge-a-nation-like-Ukraine-by-its-hooligans.html|title=Don’t judge a nation like Ukraine by its hooligans|date=8 June 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Ukrainian revolution 2014]] was announced about unification of all fans and imposed a ban on any provocation as burning attributes, fighting, offensive songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24tv.ua/ukrayina/obyednannya_ukrayini_uzhe_prodemonstruvali_ultras_i_futbolni_fani__poroshenko/n402531|title=Об'єднання України уже продемонстрували ультрас і футбольні фани, — Порошенко|author=24tv.ua|work=Телеканал новин 24|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[war in eastern Ukraine]] many hooligans and ultras went to the defense of the state.

Because of the ban internal conflicts and successes in the international stage Ukrainian hooligans pay attention to foreign fans. After the match between [[FC Dnipro]] and [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint Etienne]] in [[Kiev]] several French fans were hospitalized with the stabbing. August 20, 2015 there was a big fight in [[Hydropark (Kiev Metro)|Hydropark]] between [[Legia Warsaw|Legia]] and [[Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo]]&amp;[[Zorya Luhansk|Zorya]] hools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ua.korrespondent.net/kyiv/3553356-u-kyievi-pobylysia-fanaty-dynamo-i-lehii|title=У Києві побилися фанати Динамо і Легії|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest clash since unification occurred in Kiev, 6 December 2016 between [[Dynamo Kiev|Dynamo]] and [[Besiktas]] hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultras-tifo.net/photo-news/4651-cl-dynamo-kyiv-besiktas-06-12-2016.html|title=CL: DYNAMO KYIV - BESIKTAS 06.12.2016|author=ultras-tifo.net|work=Ultras' news cite|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Turks it was very important match, because win of [[Turkey]] team mean's qualification to the European top stage.

====1920s====
The first murder related with Argentine football occurred on 21 September 1922 in [[Rosario]], during the second half of a match between [[Tiro Federal|Tiro Federal Argentino]] (in its stadium) and [[Newell's Old Boys]] for the Copa Estímulo of the local first division, in a discussion between two fans. Enrique Battcock, a railroad worker and supporter of the home club (also former footballer and former member of the club's directing) was interpellated for Francisco Campá (Newell's Old Boys' supporter and member of the club's directing) for his behaviour, which carried a discussion that ended when Battcock hit in the face to Cambá, who retired from the stadium, returned after a little while, extracted a gun and shot him, causing Battcock's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salvemosalfutbol.org/lista-de-victimas-de-incidentes-de-violencia-en-el-futbol/ Victims list] Salvemos al Fútbol&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 1924 in [[Montevideo]] ([[Uruguay]]), occurred another murder where an Argentina fan was involved. After the final match of the [[1924 South American Championship|South American Championship]] of this year between Uruguay and Argentina (that Uruguay won), in the Colón Hotel (where the [[Argentine national football team]] was staying) broke out a fight among Uruguay supporters and Argentine fans and footballers, where José Lázaro Rodríguez (a recognized Argentine supporter of Boca Juniors and the national team) shot to Pedro Demby, an Uruguayan fan that died consequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pelotaafuera.blogspot.com/2009/11/85-anos-de-la-muerte-de-pedro-demby.html To 85 years of the death of Pedro Demby] Pelota Afuera&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s====
On 14 May 1939 at the stadium of [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] (in the city of [[Lanús]], in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]), in a match of the minor divisions of the local team and Boca Juniors (previous to the match of the main teams of both clubs), after a foul committed by a player of Lanús, both teams began to fight. Seeing this, Boca Juniors fans wanted to tear down the fence and invade the pitch, prompting the police to fire shots to disperse them. But a police officer named Luis Estrella shot into the stands, killing two spectators: Luis López and Oscar Munitoli (a 9-year old).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=920643 An undesirable list who grow...] La Nación&lt;/ref&gt;

====1940s====
But this violence was not only among fans, footballers or the police, but also against the referees. On 27 October 1946, during a match between Newell's Old Boys and [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] at Newell's Old Boys stadium (in the city of [[Rosario]]), local fans tried to strangle the referee Osvaldo Cossio. The match was tied on two goals when Cossio annulled a goal of the premises, and the third goal of San Lorenzo de Almagro in the next play worsened the situation. 89 minutes into the game, several Newell's Old Boys fans entered the pitch, hit the umpire and tried to hang him with his own belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2010/03/17/noticia_0049.html The shortest match of the history] La Capital&lt;/ref&gt;

====1950s====
Although in [[Football in Argentina|Argentine football]] violence was already present from the beginning (late 19th century), the organized groups ([[Barra brava|barras bravas]]) appeared in the 1950s (barras bravas of [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]], [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]], [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]], [[Rosario Central]], [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]], Racing, etc.) and 1960s (barras bravas of [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]], Boca Juniors, River Plate, etc.), and continued to grow in the coming decades. With the time, every big and small football club in Argentina started to have its own corresponding barra brava, and all are violent or prepared for violence. In Argentina there are the most dangerous organized supporter groups in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124431/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html |archive-date=2 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most powerful of them are the barras bravas of [[Club Atletico Independiente|Independiente]] ([[La barra del Rojo|La Barra Del Rojo]]), [[Club Atlético Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]] and [[Newell's Old Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota1/d-07701.htm |title=Clarín digital &amp;#124; Deportes. River: la barra más temida |publisher=Edant.clarin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But this phenomenon suffered a major transformation in the late 1950s. The journalist Amílcar Romero sets 1958 as the beginning of the current barras bravas (although some had already existed since some years), with the random murder by the police of Mario Alberto Linker (a Boca Juniors supporter -not identified as such- that circumstantially was watching a match between [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] and River Plate at the [[Estadio José Amalfitani|José Amalfitani]] stadium), that was located in the grandstand of River Plate fans when some of them started a fight and the police burst throwing tear gas grenades, one of which hit to Linker in the chest, causing his death. Because of this murder in October 1958, the society notes the existence of this organized groups (the barras bravas). The so-called "industrialization of football" was the kickoff for this organization, because needed to control all aspects involved in the game. Before the emergence of these groups, when a team played as a visitor, was pressured by rival fans. This prompted the organization of the barras bravas in response to that pressure:

{{quote|In Argentine football, it was well established that if you played as the visiting team, you were inexorably in a tight spot. Although they were not barras bravas as we know them today, local fans would pressure you, and the police, when not looking the other way, would pressure you as well. That had to be offset by a doctrine that in the next decade became common currency: the only means by which to neutralize any effectual group with a reputation and capacity for violence, is with another, closer-knit group with as great, or greater, reputation for violence.|source=&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-22673-2003-07-13.html The barras appear with the industrialization of the football] Página/12&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=Amílcar Romero}}

In this way, each club began having his barra brava, which was funded by the leaders of the institution. These groups were given their tickets and paid trips to the stadium, adding later other forms of financing. But the access to these "benefits" by the barra brava depended of the hierarchy inside her. For the barra brava to be prestigious, it had to be violent, so they began to increase the number of dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota2/r-02401d.htm The origins of an evil without remedy] Clarín, especial "Violencia en el fútbol"&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Linker, in Argentine football began a phase marked by "habituation" to the violence of the barras bravas, and an increase in the number of deaths. According to Amílcar Romero, between 1958 and 1985, 103 deaths related to football violence took place in Argentina, that is, an average of one every three months. However, it also clarifies that the origin of such deaths is not always confrontation in the stadium, and range from the premeditated clash between barras bravas outside the sporting venues, police repression against disorder, infighting in a barra brava or "accidents", its analysis tends to show some kind of negligence or violation of safety standards.

====1960s====
In 1964 more than 300 football fans died and another 500 were injured in [[Lima]] ([[Peru]]) in a riot during an Olympic qualifying match between Argentina and Perú on 24 May.&lt;ref name="Disasters in soccer stadiums"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/09/soccer.chronology |title=Disasters in soccer stadiums |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April 1967 in Argentina, before a match between [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]] and Racing de Avellaneda, a Racing fan of 15 years died murdered by the Huracán barra brava&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efdeportes.com/efd8/amilc83.htm The Souto case] EF Deportes&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó|Tomás Adolfo Ducó]] stadium.

====1980s====
From the 1980s and onwards, the nuclei of the biggest barras bravas began to attend the matches of the Argentina national football team in the [[FIFA World Cup]]s. That caused fights against supporters of other countries (sometimes were hooligans or [[ultras]]) and between the Argentine barras bravas themselves. Also, in the 1980s and the 1990s were recorded the highest levels of violence in the history of the Argentine football, and there was a new phenomenon: the internal fragmentation of the barras bravas. It was produced by the emergence of sub-groups with their own names inside the barras bravas. Sometimes these sub-groups fought among themselves to have the power within the barra brava to which they belonged.

An example of the violence of this years was the Roberto Basile's death. Before the start of a match between Boca Juniors and Racing in 1983 in the ''[[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|Bombonera]]'' stadium, this Racing supporter died after being pierced in the neck by a flare thrown from the Boca Juniors stand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-redo.net/la-bengala-perdida-15486/ The lost flare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528143424/http://www.la-redo.net/la-bengala-perdida-15486/ |date=28 May 2010 }} La Redo&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s====
In 1997 a member of La Guardia Imperial (barra brava of [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing de Avellaneda]]) was murdered by an Independiente supporter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1997/10/08/e-05701d.htm Barrabrava jailed for the murder of another supporter] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000s====
In 2001, other supporter of Racing was killed, and the barra brava of Independiente was the main suspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/02/19/d-03401.htm Nobody is taking responsibility and today are football in Racing again] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt; Independiente and Racing (both from the city of [[Avellaneda]], in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]) have a huge rivalry (they form the [[Avellaneda Derby]]), the second most important in Argentina but maybe the fiercest (noteworthy that their stadiums are apart only for about 300 meters).

The next year, one fan was killed and 12 people injured, including six police officers when fans of [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]] and [[Club Atlético Independiente]] clashed in February 2002.

An Independiente fan was shot dead, and another fan was shot in the back and hospitalized when about 400 rival fans fought outside Racing Clubs [[Estadio Juan Domingo Perón]] in [[Avellaneda]] before the match. Between 70 and 80 people were arrested as a result. The match started late when Independiente fans threw a [[smoke bomb]] at Racing Club [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], Gustavo Campagnuolo. That same weekend, 30 people were arrested and 10 police officers injured when fighting broke out at a match between [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] and [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]] in [[La Plata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1826408.stm |title=AMERICAS &amp;#124;Football fan killed in Argentina |publisher=BBC News |date=18 February 2002 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 investigation into football hooliganism in [[Argentina]] stated that football violence had become a national crisis, with about 40 people murdered at football matches in the preceding ten years. In the 2002 season, there had been five deaths and dozens of [[knife]] and [[shotgun]] casualties. At one point the season was suspended and there was widespread social disorder in the country. The first death in 2002 was at a match between fierce rivals [[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]. The match was abandoned and one Boca Juniors fan was shot dead. Boca Juniors, one of the largest clubs in Argentina, may have the largest barra brava element in the country (it is similar to the barras bravas of Independiente and River Plate), with their self-styled leader, Rafael Di Zeo, claiming in 2002 that they had over 2000 members (however there are doubts about the reliability of this information).&lt;ref&gt;The Boca group, known as La Doce (''The Twelfth'') has a long history of violence. In 2002 [[Diego Maradona]] was alleged to remain friends with the group's leaders, in spite of their reputation. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hooligans/2006647.stm Argentine hooligans revere Maradona]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, while driving up to [[Rosario]] to watch their side play [[Rosario Central]], Los Borrachos del Tablón (River's Barra Bravas) confronted a bus of Newell's firm (one of the big rival firms) on Highway 9, in a battle that killed two Newell's fans. Up to this day, some members of Los Borrachos still face charges because of the deaths.

In 2005 a footballer, Carlos Azcurra, was shot and seriously wounded by a police officer, when rival fans rioted during a [[Primera B Nacional Argentina|Primera B Nacional]] match between local [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] rivals (but not a derby) [[San Martín de Mendoza]] and [[Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba]].&lt;ref&gt;At half-time, fans had thrown rocks onto the pitch, and just before the end of the match, fans from both clubs invaded the pitch and started fighting. The players who had stayed on the pitch, including Ezcurra, tried to calm the fans, and he was shot when police tried to stop the fans by firing rubber bullets.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4238844.stm BBC NEWS | World | Americas |Argentine footballer shot in riot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, there was a confrontation&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/06/22/deportes/m-01501.htm Agited early morning] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt; between 6 members of the barra brava of Independiente and 16 members of the barras bravas of Boca Juniors and [[Defensa y Justicia]] (both were together) in the [[Czech Republic]] (the country where the three barras bravas were housed). As a result of the fight, a supporter of Boca Juniors had to be hospitalized.

In 2007, during the match of the promotion/relegation playoff of the [[2006–2007 in Argentine football|2006–2007 season]] between [[Club Atlético Nueva Chicago|Nueva Chicago]] and [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] (in the Nueva Chicago's stadium), broke out a fight between the barras bravas of both teams because, when a penalty was sanctionaty for Tigre (who was winning the match 2–1, a result that relegated to Nueva Chicago to the Second division) in the 92nd minute, the barra brava of Nueva Chicago invaded the pitch and ran on direction to the stand occupied by the supporters of Tigre to attack them. After this, were serious riots near the stadium (not only caused by the barras bravas, but also by ordinary people), and as a result of it, a fan of Tigre died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.26noticias.com.ar/locura-en-mataderos-matan-a-un-simpatizante-de-tigre-43236.html Madness in Mataderos: kill a supporter of Tigre] 26 Noticias&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010s====
On 19 March 2010 in a bar of Rosario, the ex leader of the [[Newell's Old Boys]] barra brava (Roberto "Pimpi" Camino) was shot and later died in a hospital of that city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2010/03/19/noticia_0053.html Shot dead to ''Pimpi'' Camino, ex leader of the barra brava of Newell's] La Capital&lt;/ref&gt; Camino and his sub-group led the barra brava from 2002 to 2009, when they were expelled from it due to their defeat at the hands of another sub-group, which currently dominates [[La Hinchada Más Popular]] (name of the Newell's Old Boys barra brava). Some members of the now main sub-group are the suspects of the murder, and the bar's owners are suspected of helping them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=514066 War of barras: 5 suspects arrested for the murder of "Pimpi" Camino] Ámbito financiero&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning of 4 July 2010 (the next day of the match between Argentina and Germany for quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]) in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, there was a fight between some integrants of the barras bravas of Independiente and Boca Juniors.

===Brazil===
Fans in Brazil join in organized groups known as [[torcida organizada|torcidas organizadas]] ("organized supporters") often considered criminal organizations that differ in many aspects from European hooligans. They act as the main supporters of each club and often sell products and even tickets. They have up to 60,000 members and are often involved in criminal activities other than fights such as drug dealing and threats to players. These fans establish alliances with other "torcidas organizadas" as they are called such as the alliance between Torcida Mancha Azul ([[Avaí Futebol Clube]]), Força Jovem Vasco ([[CR Vasco da Gama]]), Galoucura ([[Atlético Mineiro]]) and Mancha Verde ([[SE Palmeiras]]), the alliance between Torcida Independente ([[São Paulo F.C.]]), Torcida Jovem ([[CR Flamengo]]), Máfia Azul ([[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]]) and Leões da TUF ([[Fortaleza Esporte Clube]]) and some other alliances. The "torcidas organizadas" are usually bigger and more committed to the spectacle in the stadiums than the English hooligan fans&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but they often schedule fights against rival groups where many are injured and killed. Fans of local rivals TJP – Torcida Jovem Ponte Preta ([[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta]]) and TFI -Torcida Fúria Independente ([[Guarani Futebol Clube]]) clashed and rioted at a match in Campinas in 2002. Violence had been expected, and just before kick-off, fans started fighting. Police tried to intervene but were pelted by stones. As the fighting continued inside the stadium, a railing collapsed and numerous fans fell over 13&amp;nbsp;ft (four metres) into a pit between the stands and the pitch. Over 30 people were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2375033.stm |title=Brazil fans plummet into pit |publisher=BBC News |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Porto Alegre]] on South Brazil, [[Grêmio]] and [[Internacional]] fans, have a different way to support their teams with too much beer, no samba, no T-shirt identification, these 2 firms in this big city results in a long history of tension and conflict.

===Uruguay===
Following a 5-0 victory against arch-rivals Nacional in April 2014, Peñarol have undertaken an increasingly violent and unhinged attitude in the Uruguayan Clasico. While losing a championship play-off match against Nacional in June 2015, Peñarol's fans started a riot that delayed the game by 15 minutes before it was called off. In March 2016, Pablo Montiel - a supporter of Nacional - was shot to death by Peñarol fans after walking in the same neighborhood as Peñarol's new stadium named "Campeon del Siglo" (named after an IFFHS award not recognized by FIFA, intended as a petty insult towards Nacional). Ignacio Ruglio, a board member of Peñarol who have openly spread lies about Nacional, was interrogated by police following the murder of Montiel. In November 2016, the Uruguayan Clasico was cancelled before kick-off after Peñarol's supporters started a riot at the Estadio Centenario - one supporter was arrested holding a pistol, intended to shoot down Nacional players from the Amsterdam tribune. After winning a Clasico for Peñarol in September 2017, team captain Cristian Rodriguez openly called for murdering Nacional fans while celebrating the victory.

===El Salvador===
The ''[[Football War]]'' (Spanish: ''La guerra del fútbol''), also known as the ''Soccer War'' or ''100 Hour War'', was a brief war fought by [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]] in 1969. It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans, namely issues concerning immigration from [[El Salvador]] to [[Honduras]]. These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second [[CONCACAF|North American]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup (qualification)#CONCACAF Semifinal Round|qualifying round]] of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in the second [[CONCACAF|North American]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup (qualification)#CONCACAF Semifinal Round|qualifying round]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]] on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won 1–0. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of [[San Salvador]], which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816–1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |author2= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-203-97682-1 |pages=195–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A play-off match took place in [[Mexico City]] on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after [[extra time]].

The war began on 14 July 1969, when the El Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100 Hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. El Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. El Salvador dissolved all ties with Honduras, stating that "the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969''. p. 105 Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to border clashes between the two nations.

Football hooliganism in [[Mexico]] appears to be low key, but there have been some incidents, such as small-scale fighting between fans of [[C.F.

Fans then clashed with the police, and many fans were injured or arrested.  In March 2014 dozens of Chivas supporters clashed with police during their derby with Atlas.  Several police were hospitalized.

===United States===
While soccer is traditionally viewed in the United States as a family-friendly event, played by children and supported by parents, some violence does still occur. For junior league soccer, parents can be overzealous and be begrudged over unrelated matters and fights between parents have been documented and reported with police being called and intervening. For major league soccer, on 20 July 2008, in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] between [[Major League Soccer]] side [[Columbus Crew]] and English [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], in [[Columbus Crew Stadium|Columbus, Ohio]], a fight broke out between rival fans.

===Bangladesh===
Football hooliganism in Bangladesh does not appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when thousands of football fans rampaged at a [[Bangladesh Professional Football League|B-League]] match between [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Bangladesh)|Mohammedan Sporting Club]] and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the [[Bangabandhu National Stadium]], [[Dhaka]]. When the [[referee (association football)|referee]] disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones at the police, who had to fire [[tear gas]] at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/08/11/socceriot010811.html |title=At least 100 injured in Bangladeshi soccer riot |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=11 August 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Football hooliganism in China is often linked to accusations of corrupt refereeing, with Chinese football being plagued by allegations of match fixing in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="BBC News1892421"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chinese football fans riot over penalty |publisher=BBC News |date=25 March 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1892421.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News2036050"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chinese football fans go on rampage|publisher=BBC News |date=10 June 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2036050.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a match in 2000 between [[Shaanxi Guoli F.C.|Shaanxi Guoli]] and [[Chengdu Blades F.C.|Chengdu Wuniu]] in [[Xi'an]], football fans clashed with police who used tear gas and [[water cannon]]s to disperse the crowd. Eight people were arrested but later released.&lt;ref name="BBC News841378"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chinese football fans clash with police|publisher=BBC News |date=19 July 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/841378.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2002 hundreds of football fans rioted at a match in Xi'an between Shaanxi Guoli and [[Qingdao Jonoon F.C.|Qingdao Yizhong]], as a result of fans' suspicions of match-fixing.

Two years earlier, following crowd trouble at a match also in Xi'an, the government demanded more action to stamp out football hooliganism.&lt;ref name="BBC News1892421"/&gt;

In June 2002, riots in [[Fuzhou]], Fujian had to be put down by heavily armed paramilitary police.  The disorder started when fans were unable to watch the [[2002 World Cup|World Cup]] match between [[China national football team|China]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at an outside broadcast.&lt;ref name="BBC News2036050"/&gt; On 4 July 2004 fans rioted in Beijing when [[China national football team|China]] lost the final of the [[AFC Asian Cup]] to [[Japan national football team|Japan]], 3–1.

Japanese fans had to be protected by the police, and bussed to safety.&lt;ref name="BBC News3541380"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chinese riot after Japan victory|publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3541380.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News3582364"&gt;{{Cite news|title=China probes football violence|publisher=BBC News |date=24 August 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3582364.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioting was attributed to ill-feeling toward Japan for atrocities committed before and during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="BBC News3541380"/&gt;

===Indonesia===
Between 1995 and 2018 there has been recorded 70 deaths in Indonesian soccer by the NGO Save Our Soccer (SOS).

===India===
In [[India]], most of the documented football riots have primarily taken place in [[Kolkata]]. Everytime the [[Kolkata derby|Calcutta derby]] takes place between [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] and [[East Bengal F.C.]], tensions arise. However, it has taken the form of escalating violence twice- notably, at [[Eden Gardens]] on 16 August 1980. 16 people lost their lives that day due to a stampede. Another incident took place on 9 December 2012 at the [[Salt Lake Stadium]]. Though nobody was killed, [[Syed Nabi]], a [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] footballer, was injured by a brick thrown, according to the player, by [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eden Gardens]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/soccer/violence-mars-mohun-bagan-east-bengal-match--2492.html |title=Violence mars Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match |publisher=Indiatvnews.com |date=9 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In the 2000s, tensions surrounding the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] spilled over into sporadic riots between Jewish and Arab Israeli football fans. In December 2000 it was reported that every club in Israel was on a final warning following escalating violence and intimidation at matches.

A number of incidents have involved [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]], including racist abuse against overseas players,&lt;ref name="sundayherald001224"&gt;{{cite news|title=200 Beitar Jerusalem – Israel |work=Sunday Herald |date=24 December 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001224/ai_n13953505 |accessdate=2007-05-20 |first=Natasha |last=Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-Arab chants, use of smoke bombs and fireworks, and rioting. Beitar has a hooligan firm, [[La Familia (Beitar supporters' group)|La Familia]], whose members consider Israeli Arabs to be their enemy. In November 2007 the Israel Football Association (IFA) ordered Beitar to play their game against the Arab club, Bnei Sakhnin behind closed doors after Beitar fans, led by La Familia, broke a minute's silence for former Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin and sang chants in praise of his assassin, Yigal Amir. After a pitch invasion led by La Familia on 13 April 2008, when Beitar were leading Maccabi Herzliya, 1–0, and about to win the Israeli Premier League, the match was abandoned and the points to their opponents. Beitar was docked two points and had to play its remaining home games behind closed doors.

===Jordan===
Football riots in Jordan are generally regarded as an expression of tension between the country's Palestinian ethnic group and those who regard themselves as ethnically Jordanian, the two groups being of roughly equal size.&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/12/2010121020416452506.html |title=Rival Jordan football fans clash – Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, rioting broke out following a game between rival Amman clubs [[Al-Wehdat SC|Al-Wehdat]] and [[Al-Faisaly Club (Amman)|Al-Faisaly]] clubs. Some Al-Faisali fans threw bottles at Al-Wehdat players and their fans. About 250 people were injured, 243 of them Al-Wehdat fans, according to senior officials from the hospitals.&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net" /&gt; According to Al Jazeera, supporters of Al-Wehdat are generally of Palestinian origin, while Faisaly fans are of Jordanian origin. A similar riot occurred in 2009.&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.adhelis.com/cable/2009/07/09AMMAN1689.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216172348/http://wikileaks.adhelis.com/cable/2009/07/09AMMAN1689.html |archivedate=16 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans of the two clubs are alleged to have a history of hatred and violence towards each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/1305538.stm |title=Police 'blamed' for Congo stampede |publisher=BBC News |date=1 May 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
In January 2006 [[riot police]] attacked Libyan fans in the [[Cairo International Stadium]] after they threw missiles at the Egyptian fans in the tier above them during a match between the [[Egypt national football team]] and [[Morocco national football team|the Morocco national team]]. The Libyan fans had stayed on to watch the match after they had seen [[Libya national football team|Libya]] lose 2–1 to [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Côte d'Ivoire]] and had started taunting the home supporters. The Egyptian fans responded by asking them to leave the stadium and verbally attacking them at half time, and when, despite a plea to stop, it continued into the second half, the riot police were called in. The [[Libyan Football Association]] were fined $7,000 by the [[Confederation of African Football]] disciplinary Commission.&lt;ref name="ezilon15644"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Egypt, Libya fined for crowd violence | publisher = ezilon infobase | date = 27 January 2006 | url = http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_15644.shtml | accessdate = 2007-11-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071104044427/http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_15644.shtml | archivedate = 4 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Port Said Stadium disaster|melee]] broke out on 1 February 2012, after fans of Al-Masry, the home team in Port Said, stormed the field after a rare 3–1 win against Al-Ahly, Egypt's top team. Al-Masry supporters attacked the Al-Ahly players and their fans, who tried to escape, with knives, swords, clubs, stones, bottles, and fireworks.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} At least 79 people were killed and over 1,000 were injured from both sides in the Mediterranean port city.  On 26 January 2013 rioting broke out in Port Said in response to the announcement of death sentences for 21 individuals involved in the February 2012 disturbance. A mob of al-Masry supporters attempted to storm the prison where the sentenced were held; in the subsequent rioting 30 people were killed, including two police officers, and some 300 injured {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

===Equatorial Guinea===
At the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]], at the semi-finals between the host country Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, hooligans invaded the pitch and threw bottles and missiles at the Ghana players. The Ghana FA compared it to a war zone in a tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/05/football/afcon-semifinal-ghana-equatorial-guinea/index.html|title=Ghana-Equatorial Guinea AFCON semifinal halted due to crowd trouble|author=Tom Sweetman|date=5 February 2015|work=CNN|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambia===
Massive riots occurred during and after a Cup of African Nations qualifying game between rival neighbours Senegal and Gambia at the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in June 2003. Gambian supporters hurled missiles towards Senegalese fans and were subsequently charged by soldiers. After the game, violent clashes were reported in both Gambia and Senegal. In Gambia several severe beatings of Senegalese citizens occurred, which led to over 200 Senegalese seeking shelter at their embassy. Also, there were rumours of a fatal beating of a Senegalese citizen. In Senegal a Gambian [[BBC]] reporter was attacked and robbed by a group of youths. The riots eventually led to the closing of the border between Gambia and Senegal until order was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2976446.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Border shut after soccer clash |publisher=BBC News |date=9 June 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Copnall |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/2973194.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; African &amp;#124; Violence mars Senegal win |publisher=BBC News |date=8 June 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
Up to 125 people died and hundreds were injured when football fans stampeded at a match in [[Accra]] in 2001. [[Accra Hearts of Oak Sporting Club|Accra Hearts]] were leading 2–1 against [[Asante Kotoko]] – with five minutes left in the match – when some fans began throwing bottles and chairs onto the pitch. Police then fired tear gas into the crowd, creating panic. Fans rushed to escape the gas, and in the ensuing crush, up to 125 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/10/stadium.stampede.02 |title=CNN: 125 killed in Ghana soccer crush – May 10, 2001 |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107032650/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/10/stadium.stampede.02/ |archivedate=7 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
In Kenya, the most hotly contested rivalry is the [[Nairobi derby]] between [[A.F.C. Leopards]] and [[Gor Mahia F.C.|Gor Mahia]], both of whose fans are regularly associated with hooliganism. On 18 March 2012, a derby match was held up for over 26 minutes when a riot broke out leading to destruction of property and several people injured, after Gor Mahia midfielder [[Ali Abondo]] was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle on Leopards defender Amon Muchiri. Gor Mahia were banned by the Sports Stadia Management Board from playing in their facilities for the rest of the 2012 season, meaning that the club will not be able to play in neither the [[Nyayo National Stadium]] nor the [[Moi International Sports Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kenyanlist.com/kls-listing-show.php?id=82916 |title=Gor Mahia banned from using Sports Stadia facilities. |publisher=KenyanList.com |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kassfm.co.ke/news/sports/2323-gor-mahia-banned-from-nyayo-stadium- |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120803170034/http://www.kassfm.co.ke/news/sports/2323-gor-mahia-banned-from-nyayo-stadium- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-03 |title=Gor Mahia Banned from Nyayo Stadium |publisher=Kass FM (kassfm.co.ke) |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kenya Premier League|KPL]] Board has yet to announce further disciplinary measures on the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201203300676.html |title=Kenya: Raila Slams Football Hooligans |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a 2014 case where Gor Mahia fans are alleged to have injured [[Machakos]] residents and also vandalized property.

===Mali===
After a World Cup qualifying match between [[Mali national football team|Mali]] and [[Togo national football team|Togo]] on 27 March 2005, which Togo won 2–1, Mali fans rioted and went on a spree of destruction and violence. The trouble started when Togo scored the winning goal. Police fired tear gas at Mali fans who had invaded the pitch. The match was abandoned and the result awarded to Togo. The result set off a wave of violence in the capital of Mali, [[Bamako]]. Thousands of Mali fans in Bamako began chanting threats toward the Mali players, cars were set on fire, stores looted, property and monuments destroyed and a building housing the local Olympics committee burnt down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/03/28/mali_soccer050328.html |title=Soccer fans riot in Mali over loss |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=28 March 2005 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mauritius===
In May 1999, seven people died when rioting football fans threw [[petrol bomb]]s into a casino, following a match in [[Port Louis]] between the [[Mauritian League]] champions, Scouts Club, and Fire Brigade SC.

Ferroviário fans attacked the Dynamo players and the referee, stoned vehicles and fought running battles with riot police outside the stadium. Fifteen people, including four [[Red Cross]] workers, needed hospital treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poptel.org.uk/mozambique-news/newsletter/aim134.html#story2 |title=Government apologises for football riots |publisher=Poptel.org.uk |date=19 May 1998 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
In July 2000 twelve people died following a stampede, when they were crushed, at a World Cup qualifying match between [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in [[Harare]]. Police fired [[tear gas]] when the crowd started throwing missiles onto the pitch, after South Africa had taken a two-goal lead. After [[Delron Buckley]] scored South Africa's second goal bottles began to fly onto the pitch. The police then fired tear gas into the 60,000 crowd, who began running to the exits to escape the effects of the tear gas. The match had to be abandoned as players from both sides felt the effects of the tear gas and had to receive medical treatment. The police were condemned for firing tear gas, calling it a total over-reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826301.stm |title=Zimbabwe football riot kills 12 |publisher=BBC News |date=9 July 2000 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2002, two fans were shot when police opened fire on rioting fans at a match in [[Bulawayo]].

==Oceania==
===Australia===
Since the formation of the [[A-League]] in 2004, and the fall of the [[National Soccer League]], football hooliganism has died off in competitions and incidents have become a one-off event during seasons.

The incident with most notoriety in Australia is the Pratten Park riot in 1985 where hundreds of fans stormed the pitch midway through a [[Sydney Olympic FC|Sydney Olympic]] v [[Hakoah Sydney City East FC|Sydney City]] match. In a match between [[Melbourne Heart FC|Melbourne Heart]] and [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] in February 2013, 17 plastic seats were destroyed and flares were firing off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/04/16/03/soccer-fans-destroy-vic-stadium-seats |title=Soccer fans destroy Vic stadium seats |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206232806/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/04/16/03/soccer-fans-destroy-vic-stadium-seats |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a match between [[Sydney FC]] and Melbourne Victory in November 2013, one travelling Melbourne Victory fan was hospitalised with a stab wound by a sixteen-year-old civilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-stabbed-police-arrest-teenager-after-aleague-soccer-match-in-sydney-20131110-2x9an.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Man stabbed, police arrest teenager after A-League soccer match in Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a riot between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers broke out at a pub before the match later that day. 
At an international football friendly between [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] and [[Serbian national football team|Serbia]] in [[Melbourne]] in June 2011, fans lit flares both inside and outside the stadium, and in city streets. Banners supporting [[Ratko Mladić]], the Serbian military leader charged with war crimes by the [[International Court of Justice]], were displayed. A laser pointer was seen in use. A seat inside the stadium was deemed damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/friendly-fire-arrests-as-flares-disrupt-soccer-international-20110608-1frjs.html|title=Friendly fire: arrests as flares disrupt soccer international|publisher=The Age | location=Melbourne|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/police-angry-after-fans-let-off-flares-during-australia-v-serbia-match/story-fn7x8me2-1226071403244|title=Police flag heftier penalties for fans lighting flares at the soccer|publisher=Herald Dun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Victoria Police said they were reluctant to cover Melbourne Victory games because of unacceptable behaviour by fans.

Although it is nothing like football hooliganism in Europe (or what it used to be), anti-social events occur somewhat rarely. A primary example would be the Bourke Street Brawl between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers fans, who gathered in numbers before a match in late 2013 and had a brawl in Melbourne, concerning many who are involved with football in Australia and authorities. There are small hooligan/casual groups in Australia, the most prominent being from the League's biggest fanbases, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers though others exist within other supporter groups.

==Media portrayal==
Football hooliganism has been depicted in films such as ''[[I.D. (1995 film)|ID]]'', ''[[The Firm (1989 film)|The Firm]]'', ''[[Cass (2008 film)|Cass]]'', ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]'', ''[[Green Street (film)|Green Street]]'', ''[[Rise of the Footsoldier]]'', ''[[Awaydays]]'', ''[[The Brothers Grimsby]]'' and ''[[Eurotrip]]''. There are also many books about hooliganism, such as ''[[The Football Factory (novel)|The Football Factory]]'' and ''[[Among the Thugs]]''. Some critics argue that these media representations glamorise violence and the hooligan lifestyle.

'''''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel''''' is a sociological book written by James Ron, Harold E. Stassen Chair in International Affairs at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Inspired by his time as a member of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], as a research consultant for [[Human Rights Watch]], and as a research consultant for the [[International Red Cross]], Ron asks: "what explains why states use different kinds of violence in some cases and not others?" For Ron, institutional distinctions and international norms are key to explaining diverse repertoires of state violence against similar victims.

== Summary ==

In ''Frontiers and Ghettos'', James Ron argues that states use different methods and degrees of coercion against perceived national enemies as a result of variation in institutional contexts. 
When a targeted group is ghettoized, they are likely to become victims of severe, police-style repression but not [[ethnic cleansing]] or [[murder]]. Contrarily, when a targeted group exists on a frontier, they are more likely to become victims of cleansing and death instead of repression. This is because in ghettos, states have unrivaled control but are also bound by international and domestic legal and moral obligations to its inhabitants. Along frontiers, states have less control as well as fewer and weaker moral obligations. According to Ron, the more that a state controls a given territory, the more it feels a “bureaucratic, moral, and political sense of responsibility” for the fate of those within it.&lt;ref&gt;Ron, J. (2003). Frontiers &amp; Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of responsibility leads states to choose less overtly violent modes of repression in ghettos as compared to when states target populations exist on the periphery.

== Case Studies ==

James Ron examines five cases of ethnic violence and ethnic policing in two States, [[Serbia]] and [[Israel]], over similar periods of time. The cases are as follows:

# [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[ethnic cleansing]] on the [[Bosnia]]n frontier from 1992-1993.
# [[Serbs|Serbian]] ethnic policing against non-serbs in the [[Sandzak]] and [[Vojvodina]] from 1992-1993.
# [[Serbs|Serbian]] switch from ethnic policing in [[Kosovo]] from 1990-1997 to [[ethnic cleansing]] in 1998-1999.
# [[Israel]]i repression of [[Palestinians]] during The [[First Intifada]] in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] in 1988.
# [[Israel]]i destruction of [[PLO]] forces and Palestinian refugees during the [[1982 Lebanon War]].

Ron uses field interviews, newspaper reports and academic publications to illustrate the importance of institutional context for explaining repertoires of state violence. He argues that [[Serbia]] engaged in [[ethnic cleansing]] in [[Bosnia]] because in 1992, Bosnia became a frontier. On the other hand, [[Israel]] policed [[Palestinians]] in 1988 because [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] at the time was a ghetto, even though the threat posed by Palestinians during the 1988 uprising was greater. The more states controlled territories and peoples, the less likely their security forces were to ethnically cleanse perceived national enemies.

== Reception ==

''Frontiers and Ghettos'' was favorably received by many [[sociologists]] and [[political scientists]] as well as human rights organizations working on issues related to [[state violence]]. For example, the historian [[L. Carl Brown]], writing for ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, wrote that the book offered "a well-documented study of Ron's chosen examples and a sophisticated framework for understanding other such situations."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. Carl. (2003). Review of ''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' in ''Foreign Affairs''.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Anthony Obserschall compliments Ron for his "engaging and promising" [[hypothesis]] as well as his "fascinating" use of detail that make the footnotes as pleasurable to read as the main  text."&lt;ref&gt;''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' by James Ron. Review by: Anthony Oberschall. ''Social Forces'', Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1657-1659&lt;/ref&gt; However, Obserschall also critiques Ron on several grounds. For example, he argues that (1) the ethnic policing versus cleansing distinction is too crude for legal and normative evaluations of state violence, and (2) the frontier concept is applied inconsistently for the comparisons Ron wishes to make. In the former critique, Obserschall notes how 750 Palestinians were killed during The [[First Intifada]], 13,000 were wounded, hundreds lost their homes, and thousands were arrested and detained. In the latter critique, Obserschall writes that the Lebanese frontier and Bosnian frontier are not as comparable as Ron makes them out to be. [[Bosniaks]] in Bosnia were unarmed and defenseless whereas Palestinian paramilitaries in South Lebanon were heavily armed and frequently engaged in cross-border military actions against Israelis. Political Scientist [[Darius Rejali]] writes that Ron argues "persuasively" why it is important to study not just why violence is done, but how. He adds, "[Ron's] "study of the practice shows that international norms are far more robust than political scientists normally imagine".&lt;ref&gt;''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' by James Ron. Review by: Darius Rejali. ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 34, No. 1 (Autumn 2004), pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the establishment of the Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace (hereinafter referred to as the Panel) and in response to the high interest generated, a [https://www.genevawaterhub.org/platforms/group-friends-water-peace Group of Friends on Water and Peace] was created in early 2016. It provides a group of countries with an opportunity to interact with the work of the Panel and offers them a platform for regular dialogue on these issues. The [[Geneva Water Hub]] acts as the Secretariat of both the Global High-Level Panel and the Group of Friends on Water and Peace.

The focus of the Panel is the nexus between [[water]] and [[cooperation]] and maintenance of peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/global-high-level-panel-on-water-and-peace-to-propose-solutions-to-conflicts/articleshow/49832510.cms|title='Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace' to propose solutions to conflicts|last=Narayanan|first=Dinesh|date=2015-11-18|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes preventive activities and arrangements, such as trans-border water cooperation regimes and institutions, protection of [[water infrastructure]] during [[armed conflicts]] and water arrangements in the context of post-conflict [[Peacebuilding|peace-building]].

The Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace will present a set of recommendations at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in September 2017.

== Objectives ==
The Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace aims at taking the issue of water in the context of maintenance of peace and security, from a technical to a political level. It has the following objectives:
* Develop a set of proposals aimed at strengthening the global architecture to prevent and resolve water-related conflicts;
* Facilitate the role of water as an important factor of building peace and cooperation; and
* Enhance the relevance of water issues in national and global policy making.

== Mandate ==
* Panel members are serving in their individual capacity;
* The Panel is independent and is tasked with outlining concrete proposals and recommendations to enable water to be an instrument of peace. These proposals / recommendations will be non-binding, and will address policy issues at all levels (global, regional, national and local). However, the Panel will not make any country specific recommendations;
* The Panel is established for a period of two years, until the end of 2017;
* The mandate of the Panel comes from the fifteen co-convening countries;
* While the Panel functions outside the formal structure of the [[United Nations]], it works in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders, notably with the UN which is represented in the Panel through [[UN-Water]] as observer. It is the only body serving in this capacity. The Panel holds consultations or hearings to get inputs from all relevant organizations and stakeholders;

Very Rev '''Henry Duncan''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (8 October 1774 – 12 February 1846) was a Scottish [[Minister of the Kirk|minister]], geologist and [[social reformer]]. The minister of [[Ruthwell]] parish church in Dumfriesshire, he founded the world's first commercial savings bank. He served as [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1839. He was also an author, publisher and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Duncan was born in 1774 at [[Lochrutton]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], where his father, George Duncan, was minister. As a boy he met the poet [[Robert Burns]], who visited Lochrutton Manse. Duncan was educated in [[Dumfries]] at the [[Dumfries Academy|Academy]]. After studying for two sessions at [[St. Andrews University]] he was sent to [[Liverpool]] to begin commercial life, and under the patronage of his relative, [[James Currie (physician)|Dr. James Currie]], the biographer of [[Robert Burns]], his prospects of success were very fair; but his heart was not in business, and he soon left Liverpool to study at Edinburgh and Glasgow for the ministry of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Whilst in [[Edinburgh]] he joined the [[Speculative Society]], and became intimate with [[Francis Horner]] and [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]].{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

==Ministry and works==
In 1798 he was ordained as minister of the Church of Scotland and became Minister at [[Ruthwell]] in Dumfriesshire in 1799, where he spent the rest of his life. Duncan from the first was remarkable for the breadth of his views, especially in what concerned the welfare of the people, and the courage and ardour with which he promoted measures not usually thought to be embraced in the minister's rôle. In a time of scarcity he brought Indian corn from Liverpool. At the time when a French invasion was dreaded he raised a company of volunteers, of which he was the captain. He published a series of cheap popular tracts, contributing to the series some that were much prized, afterwards collected under the title ''The Cottage Fireside''. He originated a newspaper, ''[[Dumfries Courier|The Dumfries and Galloway Courier]]'', of which he was editor for seven years.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

===Savings banks===
The measure which is most honourably connected with Duncan's name was the institution of [[savings bank|savings banks]]. The first savings bank was instituted at Ruthwell in 1810,&lt;ref name="GFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst120.html|title=Rev. Dr. Henry Duncan|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Duncan was unceasing in his efforts to promote the cause throughout the country. His influence was used to procure the first act of parliament passed to encourage such institutions. By speeches, lectures, and pamphlets he made the cause known far and wide. The scheme readily commended itself to all intelligent friends of the people, and the growing progress and popularity of the movement have received no check to the present day. Great though his exertions were, and large his outlay in this cause, he never received any reward or acknowledgement beyond the esteem of those who appreciated his work and the spirit in which it was done.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

In 1810 Duncan opened the world's first commercial savings bank, which would eventually form part of the [[Trustee Savings Bank]], paying interest on its investors' modest savings. The bicentenary of this event was celebrated with a conference held by the [[Centre for Theology and Public Issues]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/divinity/news-events/events/henry-duncan |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331185920/http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/divinity/news-events/events/henry-duncan |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers investigated Duncan's legacy in light of current social, financial, and religious dynamics. The '''Savings Bank Museum''' tells the story of early home savings in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

===Other works===
In 1823 Duncan received the degree of D.D. from the [[University of St. Andrews]]. In 1836 he published the first volume of a work which reached ultimately to four volumes, entitled ''[[The Sacred Philosophy of the Seasons]]''. It was well received, and ran through several editions. To the ''[[Transactions of the Scottish Antiquarian Society]]'' he contributed a description of a celebrated runic cross: the [[Ruthwell Cross]] (now in Ruthwell church), one of the finest [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] crosses in Britain. This late 7th/early 8th century cross, which he discovered in his parish and restored in 1818, and on which volumes have since been written, is remarkable for its [[rune|runic]] inscription, which contains excerpts from ''[[The Dream of the Rood]]'', an [[Old English poetry|Old English poem]].{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

He made a memorable contribution likewise to geological science. In 1828 Duncan presented a paper to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Royal Society]] of [[Edinburgh]] describing the discovery of the fossil footmarks of four legged vertebrate animals in the [[Permian]] red sandstone of [[Corncockle Muir]], near [[Lochmaben]]&lt;ref name="Duncan1831"&gt; Duncan, H. 1831. An account of the tracks and footmarks of animals found impressed on sandstone in the quarry of Corncockle Muir, in Dunfreisshire. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 11:194-209. &lt;/ref&gt;. The paper, published in 1831, was one of the first two scientific reports of a fossil track (the other being made by [[Mr. J. Grierson]]&lt;ref&gt; Grierson, J. 1928. On footsteps before the flood, in a specimen of res sandstone. Edinburgh Journal of Science, 8:130-134.&lt;/ref&gt;). A cast of the tracks of ''Chelichnus duncani'' can be found in the [[Royal Museum|National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

While at first not very decided between the moderate and the evangelical party in the church, Duncan soon sided with the latter, and became the intimate friend of such men as Dr. Chalmers and Dr. [[Andrew Mitchell Thomson|Andrew Thomson]]. In the earlier stages of the controversy connected with the Scottish church he addressed letters on the subject to his old college friends [[Lord Brougham]] and the [[Marquis of Lansdowne]], and to [[Lord Melbourne]], home secretary.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

In 1839 Duncan became [[List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] of the [[Church of Scotland]], and at the time of the [[Disruption of 1843]] became one of the founding ministers of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]&lt;ref name="GFS"/&gt; leaving a manse and grounds that had been rendered very beautiful by his taste and skill.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

Henry Duncan was visited by [[Robert Murray M'Cheyne]] during his vacations in Ruthwell.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Duncan was a man of most varied accomplishments — manual, intellectual, social, and spiritual. With the arts of drawing, modelling, sculpture, landscape-gardening, and even the business of an architect, he was familiar, and his knowledge of literature and science was varied and extensive. In private and family life he was highly estimable, while his ministerial work was carried on with great earnestness and delight. The [[stroke]] of paralysis that ended his life on 19 February 1846 fell on him while conducting a religious service in the cottage of an elder.{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=165}}

==Family==
Duncan's first wife whom he married in November 1804 was Agnes Craig, daughter of his predecessor, the Rev. John Craig. They had two sons and a daughter. Agnes Duncan died of influenza in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Sophy: Dr Duncan of Ruthwell, Founder of Saving's Banks, by his great Granddaughter, Edinburgh: Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan's second wife whom he married in 1836 was Mary Grey, daughter of George Grey of [[West Ord]], sister of [[John Grey (land agent)|John Grey]] of Dilston, a well-known Northumbrian gentleman (see memoir by his daughter, Mrs. Josephine Butler), widow of the Rev. [[R. Lundie]] of [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]], and mother of [[Jane Lundie Bonar]]. She was a lady of considerable accomplishments and force of character, and author of several books:{{sfn|Blaikie|1888|p=166}}
# "Memoir of the Rev. M. Bruen".
# ''[[Memoir of Mary Lundie Duncan]]'' (her daughter, author of several well-known hymns for children).
# ''[[Missionary Life in Samoa, being the Life of George Archibald Lundie]]'' (her son).
# ''[[Children of the Manse]]''.
# "America as I found it".

Duncan's son George John Craig Duncan was born in 1806. He became the minister at [[Kirkpatrick Durham]]. His wife was [[Isabelle Wight Duncan]] who was a notable author.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D. Snobelen, ‘Duncan , Isabelle Wight (1812–1878)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/74811, accessed 19 Nov 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
Henry Duncan's daughter Barbara referred to by Thomas Carlyle as "the bonny little Barbara Duncan" married the Rev. James Dodds of Dunbar.

==Legacy==
The headquarters of [[TSB Bank (United Kingdom)|TSB Bank]] (a descendent of the original Trustee Savings Bank) is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tsb.co.uk/legal/information/information-about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS epidemic===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the United States}}
{{See also|History of HIV/AIDS}}

In May 1983, when ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was published, the AIDS epidemic in New York City has only recently begun and panic about the unknown causes, means of transmission and potential for treatment for AIDS was spreading rapidly.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; The misconception that there was something inherent in the lifestyle of all gay men that put them at risk for infection was common at the time and led to the development of a [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding both the disease and [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]].&lt;ref name=prom&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3397576 |jstor=3397576 |title=How to Have Promiscuity in an Epidemic |journal=October |volume=43 |pages=237 |year=1987 |last1=Crimp |first1=Douglas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Sonnabend wrote that "it may be impossible for those who did not directly experience the uncertainty and terror of the early years of AIDS to appreciate the circumstances under which these guidelines [for safe sex] were constructed."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

At the time when ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was written, there was no consensus on the cause of AIDS, but two main theories existed: the "new agent theory," which was increasingly the scientific consensus, and the "multifactorial theory," which Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend adopted as their basis for [[sexual education]] around AIDS transmission prevention. The new agent theory proposed that AIDS was caused by a single, previously unknown [[pathogen]], likely a [[retrovirus]] similar to the [[Human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV).&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; According to the multifactorial theory, however, continual overexposure to [[semen]], specifically [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) in semen, lead to an eventual state of [[immunosuppression]] that characterized AIDS.&lt;ref name=multi&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1984.tb37134.x |pmid=6100000 |title=A Multifactorial Model for the Development of Aids in Homosexual Men |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=437 |pages=177–83 |year=1984 |last1=Sonnabend |first1=Joseph A |last2=Witkin |first2=Steven S |last3=Purtilo |first3=David T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on prior scientific studies that revealed the role that CMV can play in causing cellular immune-related abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, Scott D..''

As a result of the lack of agreement on AIDS cause and transmission, it was difficult to determine the risk of various forms of sexual contact. Berkowitz, in the introduction to his [[autobiography]], describes how, in the early years of the epidemic, [[risk]] categorizations were rewritten every few months: "anal sex with a condom became an endless back and forth [[dance]], from high risk to medium risk to low risk to possibly safe." &lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was this confusion that prompted the authors to create a safe sex manual that clearly outlined for men having sex with men the dangers of each type of contact and various methods to protect oneself from exposure.

===LGBT culture and politics===
{{Main|LGBT rights in the United States}}
{{See also|Media portrayal of HIV/AIDS}}

After the [[Sexual Revolution]] and the [[Gay Liberation]] in the 1960s and `70s, sex in urban gay epicenters was not only newly acceptable, but also often seen as key to gay identity and resistance to [[heteronormativity]]. AIDS brought up a renewed fear about negative media coverage and the [[civil rights]] violations that [[LGBT people]] might face from targeted quarantines and a denial of basic healthcare services.&lt;ref name=prom /&gt; As such, the issue of safe sex was a contentious one, and any arguments criticizing frequent sex were poorly received by the majority of the community.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; A large sector of LGBT community leadership worried that raising awareness about AIDS and gay sex would be off-putting to the straight majority and damage the image of the subculture as a whole.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier&gt;Escoffier, Jeffrey (1998-99).

The authors of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' were aware of the political risks they took in creating the booklet: Berkowitz noted in his autobiography the possibility that their writing could be used as ammunition by homophobic institutions and leaders.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; However, their advocacy was motivated by the increasingly critical state of the health crisis and their shared belief in what Callen described as the danger of "put[ting] political considerations over the tragedy of even a single gay man's death."&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

Before the AIDS epidemic, condoms were mostly advertised and used for preventing pregnancies and therefore were not considered a viable safe sex or STD prevention tool among the LGBT community: David France estimates that less than 1% of men who have sex with men in New York City used them regularly in the 1970s, despite the fact that many other sexually transmitted diseases, including cytomegalovirus and [[hepatitis B]], were already at "endemic" levels.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Sonnabend writes about condoms at the time: "I think most gay men said, 'Oh thank god, that's one thing we don't have to worry about,'"&lt;ref name=france /&gt; and many didn't know how to use one.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann, Jason.

Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend would show them, condoms really were something to worry about and could be an easy way to prevent disease and death while continuing to have a normal and fulfilling sex life.

Along with ''Play Fair!'', its San Francisco counterpart written by a [[drag (clothing)|drag]] group called the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]], ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was the first [[sex-positive]] manuals for safe sex—in other words, it did not present sex in a negative, shameful or moralistic light. Sonnabend writes in the introduction to the booklet that one of their goals was to "explore the many different forms of sexual expression open to gay men."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; As [[David France (writer)|David France]] later recounted, the authors actively tried to avoid condescension or arrogance in their writing (despite the fact that Callen himself had acknowledged that telling people how to have sex is inherently an arrogant thing to do), instead attempting to establish a dialogue, "[[Queen (slang)|queen]] to queen," between themselves and the people for whom they created the manual.&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; Callen even educated himself about different [[philosophers]], including [[Hannah Arendt]], to get an idea of the best way to productively use writing to influence people through rhetoric and written arguments.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; The independent and community-driven nature of this approach to LGBT-related safe sex, according to [[Cindy Patton]], can be traced back to the "self-help model" promoted in the women's health movement.&lt;ref name=ACTUP&gt;Gould, Deborah B.

{{see also|Safe sex}}

The primary message of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' is 1) to use [[Sexual protection|protection]] (i.e., condoms) during sex and 2) to limit the specific sex acts one performs to those with a lower risk of contagion. It was a model that attempted to challenge traditional anti-promiscuity and anti-gay viewpoints in previous safe sex education and AIDS prevention—as Callen and Berkowitz argued, it's what you do, not how often you do it or who you do it with. In other words, they had searched for, and come up with, what they termed the possibility of "life-affirming sex."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

The categories below contain summaries of the chapters of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' and the arguments presented therein:

=== What causes AIDS? ===
The authors introduce the two presiding theories of AIDS transmission and present their arguments for the multifactorial model. They describe the role of CMV in causing abnormalities in immune cells, as well as the potential for gradual immune overload by semen and harmful [[immune complexes]] resulting from the binding of [[antibodies]] to [[antigens]] on other STDs. This section presents evidence against the "new agent theory" but acknowledges that in either case, AIDS is likely sexually transmitted and therefore the best method of prevention will be the use of protection and more critical choice in which sexual acts to perform.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

=== CMV in connection with AIDS ===
In this section, Callen and Berkowitz elaborate on the multifactorial model to provide a basis for later applications of safe sex practices. They cite the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' study that found that traces of CMV were found in 94% of [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]] in a New York City cohort in 1981, but later estimate that CMV was present in ¼ of [[sexually active]] gay men in 1982-83, which, when factoring in the average frequency and diversity of partners in the population of sexually active gay men in New York City, would still amount to a high number of exposures per year.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb et al 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; The reasoning behind their support of the multifactorial theory was the concurrent [[epidemics]] of AIDS and CMV in the same sexual networks and locations; they called it the "one common link found in all gay men with AIDS." They summarize the characteristics of CMV and its links to AIDS as the following:&lt;ref name=multi /&gt;
* Cytomegalovirus itself is a type of [[herpesvirus]] that is present in [[bodily fluids]].  
* It remains in the body for more than a year after the immune system has fought off its initial effects.  
* It often manifests again in people with severely compromised immune systems (i.e., those with AIDS).  
* It was also found in some KS tumors of people with AIDS, and can activate the [[Epstein Barr virus]], causing [[lymphoma]] and [[lymphadenopathy]] (both common symptoms of AIDS). 
* Like HIV, CMV has a [[latency period]] that makes it easily transmittable and impossible to discern when picking sexual partners.

This part of the manual stresses the fact that it's not a single infection putting people at risk, but instead repeated exposure to the virus in semen, particularly through anal-receptive intercourse. In addition to the specific cytomegalovirus in sperm, the authors argue that simply exposing the body to such high intake levels of sperm itself can present a health risk. Although the multifactorial model had been criticized for failing to account for the sudden appearance of AIDS, the authors use the fact that the rate of CMV infections in urban sexually active gay men rose significantly in last decade as evidence of the "new" component that accounts for the rapid increase in AIDS cases.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=multi /&gt; They advise readers to get tested for CMV and describe which tests to get (e.g. antibody tests or [[virus|viral]] isolation of CMV from [[urine]] and semen), but also acknowledge that the price of such tests ($200) and the fact that it was not routinely offered at traditional clinics and labs might make it inaccessible to most patients.

=== Ethics and responsibility ===
In this section, the authors stress the need for the gay male community to come together to protect itself.  A central component of this was that one's own sexual health and the health of others should "never became separated." They wrote that it was important to think about not only what sexual acts would put oneself in a risky position in terms of disease transmission, but also what would be dangerous for one's partner. They recognize the importance of maintaining mental control during sex, and argue that although it's easy to forget about safety in the heat of the moment, the growing threat of sickness and death should be enough to motivate people to act with foresight. Their primary piece of advice within the "control" subsection is not abstinence; instead, it centers around the importance of staying sober during sexual encounters in order to make informed decisions. This, Callen and Berkowitz write, means not drinking, smoking, or taking poppers before going clubbing. They also emphasize the importance of communication with one's partner in the broader discussion of maintaining control, including the need to talk about health concerns, disease status, and convince him to engage in whatever sexual acts safely.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

=== Risk categories ===
Much of the rest of the pamphlet is dedicated to discussing the many possible forms of sexual expression available to gay and bisexual men and providing a thorough analysis of the risk associated with each particular act. This analysis is warranted by the fact that, as the authors recognized, different diseases spread through different types of contact, and specifically AIDS/CMV (as they saw it back then) is much more easily transmitted through certain sex acts.

''Note that some of these categorizations are incorrect given current knowledge about HIV transmission, and the descriptions below should not be presumed to be the medical consensus.''&lt;ref name=ca&gt;Wilton, James (Fall 2012). "Putting a number on it: The risk from an exposure to HIV." CATIE: Canada's source for HIV and Hepatitis C information. http://www.catie.ca/en/pif/summer-2012/putting-number-it-risk-exposure-hiv. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;Sucking (i.e. giving [[oral sex]]):&lt;/u&gt; The authors categorize sucking as having a "moderate" risk: although the exposure to semen is not as direct as when it is taken in anally, they state that oral sex, for the person coming into contact with semen, is not risk free (for CMV infection) except with condom use. The compromise they suggest is to avoid having your partner come in your mouth, and, if they do accidentally, to spit out the [[ejaculate]] to reduce the risk of transmission.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Getting sucked (receiving oral sex):&lt;/u&gt; According to ''How to Have Sex,'' oral sex probably has no risk for the receiver, but there are still [[hygiene]] protocols such as washing, not coming in the person's mouth, etc. that someone in this position should follow to protect the health of his partner. Additionally, it is only risk free from the perspective of CMV/AIDS, as there are plenty of other pathogens that can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Fucking ([[Anal sex|anal penetrative/insertive]]):&lt;/u&gt; This is another position where the authors identified little to no risk for CMV transmission. Again, their main argument is that it is still necessary to wear a condom to protect one's partner, and, by extension, the sexually active community of men who have sex with men as a whole. Because condoms were not commonly used at the time, the authors conceded that if someone finds it difficult to get used to the sensation to the point where they are dissuaded from using a condom altogether, they should at least [[Coitus interruptus|pull out]] before coming to prevent exposing their partner to semen. They also point out the risk of condoms [[tearing]], particularly as most at the time were designed for vaginal, not anal, intercourse. David France recounts that while Callen and Berkowitz were ready to put all of anal sex into the "never again category" (i.e. high risk), Sonnabend, from his experience in clinical practice, was able to see that the people with the majority of the infections were those who were bottoms (i.e. those in the anal-receptive position), which then allowed him to discern a differential in risk depending on one's position in the sexual relationship.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Getting fucked (i.e. anal-receptive):&lt;/u&gt; Being penetrated in unprotected anal sex was identified as the act with the greatest risk for contracting CMV, and, under the multifactorial model, AIDS. This follows naturally from the fact that anal sex results in the [[ejaculation]] of semen into the rectum, where it is easily absorbed by the [[mucosa]] into the [[bloodstream]]. Callen and Berkowitz made sure to acknowledge, however, that this statement about high risk is not a condemnation of [[bottom (sex)|bottom]]s/men who are penetrated in gay sex. The authors incorporate a feminist critique into the pamphlet, arguing that the ingrained concept that [[manliness]] is compromised in the act of being penetrated in gay sex can create a certain degree of [[defensiveness]] when it comes to accepting that this is inherently a more dangerous position to be in, in terms of contracting AIDS. This is a prime example of how ''How to Have Sex'' attempted to address every element of its education in a sex-positive and affirming way. "Remember that the issue is disease--not sex," they tell their readers.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Rimming]] (anal-oral):&lt;/u&gt; The authors identified this as a high risk activity, stating that there is no way to rim in a risk-free way without being in a [[monogamous relationship]] where both people have been tested. Their advice is to avoid it unless the above criteria are met.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Kissing]]:&lt;/u&gt; ''How to Have Sex'' describes kissing as an activity with moderate risk of CMV transmission, although this risk, they say, can be mitigated partially by kissing with closed lips. They discuss the social and emotional importance of kissing and the negative impact that avoiding it could have on the gay community.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Low risk alternatives:&lt;/u&gt; The authors include various pieces of advice about how to change or moderate one's sexual behavior to avoid getting infected. Among these are [[masturbation]] and alternative methods of [[Sexual penetration|penetration]], including the use of [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingers]], [[Sex toy|toys]], [[dildos]], etc. They describe dildos as a good and relatively safe way to avoid contracting STDs, with the caveat that they be 1) flexible and relatively short to avoid wounds, 2) washed and disinfected regularly, and 3) not shared from person to person. They suggest ways of getting creative with mutual masturbation and jerk-off clubs, as well as "closed circles of fuck buddies," that create the possibility for safer but non-[[monogamous]] sex. They describe jerk-off clubs as typically having a friendly and welcoming atmosphere and clearly posted rules, and encourage their readers to ask around for these in their area or develop their own versions. However, Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend also acknowledge that the "closed circles," based on the concept that a group of uninfected people can freely have unprotected sex as long as they do so only within that same group, are very much reliant on the trustworthiness of all members and are therefore more risky than monogamy. Furthermore, it was difficult to determine one's HIV status at the time of the book's publishing, given that the virus itself hadn't even been isolated, much less an antibody test designed to diagnose infection.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Urolagnia|Water sports]] (sexual activity involving urine):&lt;/u&gt; Because CMV is found in high quantities in urine, ''How to Have Sex'' describes water sports as something to be avoided, particularly anything that resulted in urine inside the rectum.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Fisting]]:&lt;/u&gt; This activity, although it is described as "extremely dangerous" in other capacities, had no known connection to AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Sadism and masochism:&lt;/u&gt; The authors take a positive stance on S&amp;M, but emphasize the importance of setting limits and using protection within this environment and limiting the acts one performs to avoid direct bodily fluid contact between people. Most important in this setting, they explain, is prior communication between the people involved about the need to have safe sex, which can naturally be incorporated into the customary setting of boundaries, [[safe words]], etc. that occurs in the context of S&amp;M.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Washing up:&lt;/u&gt; Although this is not a sexual act, per se, Callen and Berkowitz stress the importance of washing with soap and water both before and after sex. They recommend Betadine soap with [[iodine]] and an [[antimicrobial]] soap scrub called [[Hibiclens]]. True to their sex-positive style, they recommend making showering part of the [[foreplay]].&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;"[[Backroom]]s, Bookstores, Balconies, Meatracks and Tearooms" and "[[BathHouse|The Baths]]":&lt;/u&gt; These locations, generally sites designed for [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] and casual, public sex, were a highly risky environment for disease spread of all kinds. Backrooms and similar spaces tend to be dark and have limited washing facilities. The authors recognize that it is still possible to have medically safe sex in these situations, only much more difficult. The solutions, then, as presented in ''How to Have Sex,'' are "talking, washing, light and rubbers." They recommend talking to one's potential partner, even something as simple as "been here long?" to scope out how potentially infectious the person is, as well as to communicate about one's safe sex preferences (be it using condoms, not performing certain acts, using dildos, etc.). The authors say that, if the person gets defensive (which is understandable, given that the implication is that he will give you a disease), you should politely move on. They strongly recommend going to a place with [[shower]] facilities and also suggest some form of examination of one's partner's body before sex as another assessment of their health; they write, "you don't have to be clinical. Make it a part of foreplay." Lastly, in these situations where sex is often anonymous, exchanging numbers is a good way to be able to keep track of one's sexual encounters and communicate should someone become infected—this is part of the more community-driven mindset that the authors wanted to promote around sex. Lastly, Berkowitz and Callen recognize that visiting the baths is habitual for many gay men, and discuss the strategy that some have been using of masturbating before going to give oneself more self control and prevent risky behavior.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;[[Poppers]]:&lt;/u&gt; A common theory circulating in the early `80s was that the use of poppers (amyl and butyl nitrates), a common party drug in the LGBT nightclub scene, was a cofactor for AIDS transmission. However, the authors of ''How to Have Sex'' refute this idea, citing scientific proof vindicating the drug, although they also mention that there is a small transmission risk increase associated with taking poppers because it dilates the blood vessels, thus facilitating the entry of microorganisms.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;"Poppers." NAM AIDSMAP. https://www.aidsmap.com/Poppers/page/1322957/. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw attention to the dangers of poppers outside the realm of disease transmission, including the drugs' extreme toxicity when swallowed.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Prostitution|Buying sex]]:&lt;/u&gt; Callen and Berkowitz stress the importance sexual health in sex work, as well. To those in the position of paying for the sex, they say to make sure their partner respects their health concerns, or else look for someone else. They also warn their readers that, while escort services may claim that their employees are healthy, they cannot actually know for sure and cannot be entirely trusted.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Hustling]]/selling sex:&lt;/u&gt; True to their sex-positive and nonjudgemental tone, the authors first acknowledge hustling as an important source of income for some men who have sex with men. Instead of condemning prostitution, they suggest that sex workers advertise protected sex specifically. They also recognize the unique difficulties posed for hustlers in prioritizing their sexual health because they are "in the business of satisfying others' needs" and emphasize the need to establish guidelines for safe sex before getting together. According to ''How to Have Sex,'' bilateral prevention of disease transfer in sex work is important in a [[global health]] context because sex workers were key to the national and international spread of AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Should people with AIDS have sex?===
Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend begin this section by stating that, regardless of how controversial and subjective the question may be, some people with AIDS do continue to have sex after being infected, whether knowingly or unknowingly, although many may be so incapacitated that sex is "the furthest thing from their minds." The solution, they argue, does not involve treating people with AIDS (PWA) like [[lepers]], as they are just as [[human]] as the rest of the population, desire the same human contact and will simply end up being unwilling to disclose their [[HIV status]] if automatic ostracism is the result. In all likelihood, the authors contend, the risk of unprotected sex to the person with AIDS is higher than to the uninfected person, as any number of STDs can have a dangerous health impact on someone with a compromised [[immune system]]. For a person with AIDS to go to the baths or backrooms would therefore be "extremely unwise."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

Based on the multifactorial model of AIDS transmission, the uninfected person would simply be at risk for being exposed to high levels of CMV-infected semen.&lt;ref name=multi /&gt;  However, the reality is that the risk of having sex with someone with AIDS is higher than they described because it is caused by a single virus (HIV) that PWA (and people with HIV pre-AIDS) have and uninfected people do not.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Either way, they conclude in all capital letters that AIDS PATIENTS HAVE AN [[ETHICAL]] OBLIGATION TO ADVISE POTENTIAL PARTNERS OF THEIR HEALTH STATUS." It should be up to the uninfected person to make the informed decision to have sex, evaluating all the risk factors. However, sex between a PWA and an uninfected person, according to the pamphlet, would be fine if they are monogamous lovers and use protection. Given scientific evidence against casual transmission of AIDS, the authors saw no reason to discourage other forms of [[affection]] and touching.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Guilt, morality and sex negativity===
''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' stresses the importance of separating valid medical advice from moral-based arguments disguised as medicine. In this section, the authors discuss the difficulties posed by the obvious connection between gay sex and the disease, especially given that men who have sex with men, as well as [[transgender women]], were, even before the outbreak of AIDS, often accused of having too much sex by the [[Moral Majority]]. Advice during the initial stage of the epidemic was to "cut down" on the frequency of sex, without giving any thought to the type of sex. The authors describe their attempt to correct this incomplete advice by educating people on what types of sexual acts are higher risk as a way to present them with an alternative to [[abstinence]]/self-denial and encourage a sex-positive mentality.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

The example they provide in the pamphlet is a man who decides to limit the number of times he has sex to 12 per year, but does not change what he does with his partners or how he does it (e.g. with protection or not). The authors conclude that this will not prevent him from putting himself at high risk for contracting AIDS at some point during the year. They stress that sex is not a [[vice]], and therefore giving up sex to avoid getting AIDS is not the same as giving up [[smoking]] to avoid [[lung cancer]]. It should be noted that the advice to cut down on only the frequency of sex and sexual partners was even less productive under the "new virus model" as opposed to the multifactorial model.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

Callen and Berkowitz also bring up the fact that [[anonymity|anonymous]] sex was highly criticized by the straight majority, but telling one's partner one's name will not make a difference to the [[infectivity]] of the pathogen. However, they recognize anonymity during sex might make the issue of protecting one's partner from disease transmission less pressing and/or personally important.

This section of the manual also highlights the importance of talking to one's [[physicians]] and making sure the information one gets about the disease is reliable by looking at multiple [[source text|sources]] and doing individual [[research]]. They conclude: "If we are to celebrate our gayness and get on with [[Gay Liberation]], we must stay healthy. To stay healthy, we must realize that the issue isn't gayness or sex; the issue is simply disease."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Love===
The penultimate section of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was added after both Sonnabend and Richard Dworkin read it over and were struck by the complete absence of the word "love" in a manual about safe sex.&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Afterwards, the authors realized the potential it had as a moral and emotional justification for the use of protection and added this section, starting by admitting, "It came as quite a shock to us to find that we had written almost 40 pages on sex without mentioning the word "love" once." David France explain that Callen and Berkowitz both "cared deeply for their vast sexual communities" and Sonnabend agreed, saying, "you could really love somebody even for just four hours. Genuinely."&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

In this section, the authors describe the years post-Sexual Revolution as a time when sex and love were accepted as being distinct and that STD epidemics were a product of this newfound freedom, not just within the LGBT community but everywhere. If one cares about one's partner or accepts sex as something that is "interpersonally meaningful," they argue, that should be motivation enough to use protection for the sake of both one's partner and oneself. The authors build on their feminist critique, claiming that the challenge facing the gay male community is to undo their "socialization as men" who are "trained to destroy" and to compete with one another and instead promote a community of people who take care of one another. Maybe, they argue, the goal of gay male liberation is to be able to love one's partner even when society teaches them not to. "Men loving men was the basis of gay male liberation, but we have now created 'cultural institutions' in which love or even affection can be totally avoided," they write. They also pose the question to their readers: "Have we modified the belief that we could [[dance]] our way to liberation into the belief that we could somehow fuck our way there?" They end with this statement: "If you Love the person you are fucking with -- even for one night -- you will not want to make them sick. Maybe affection is our best protection."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Conclusion===
In the pamphlet's short section of "closing thoughts," the authors reiterate that "the party of the `70s is over" and that ignorance in the baths and backrooms has now turned into a form of oppression. They add that, because many members of the LGBT community are not well educated or able to afford successive healthcare visits, it's doubly important to disseminate correct, reliable information was widely as possible. Their final call is not for an end to sex, but an end to "sex without responsibility."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

However, the authors of ''How to Have Sex'' also faced significant barriers in disseminating their message, most of which was due to their message's lack of popularity within the majority of the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; All of their applications for [[grants]] were rejected, and attempts to create a broader educational campaign built around the booklet's teachings were blocked by both the [[New York City government]] and organizations within the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=film&gt;Wein, Daryl.

Berkowitz recounts in an [[interview]] it being "infuriating" that in 1985, the city still hadn't adopted any standard safe sex education.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

The advent of safe sex in urban gay male populations came too late for many people: by 1983, more than 1,476 people had died from AIDS and David France estimated that as much as half of all MSM in New York City and San Francisco had been infected.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;''The AIDS Epidemic: 1981-1987.'' [[The New York Times]], 1999. https://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/aids/timeline80-87.html. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Retrospective analysis by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] found that there were between 250,000-300,000 people living with HIV in the United States in 1983, and the number of people newly infected between `83-`84 was around 150,000).&lt;ref name=cdc /&gt; However, the model set forth by Callen and Berkowitz at least provided the possibility of a "return to intimacy" for people with AIDS, which, despite being based on a now-defunct notion of how the syndrome arose, was important in combating the [[social death]] that many PWA faced after [[diagnosis]].&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; 
 
''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was also credited with laying a foundation for safe sex education outside of the LGBT community. Duke Global Health Institute founder Michael Merson describes lessons from this grassroots movement—e.g. the importance of [[contraceptives]] over abstinence—as being key in "a generation of prevention approaches to follow," including [[PEPFAR]] (which was criticized for its emphasis on abstinence) and [[The Global Fund]].&lt;ref name="merson"/&gt; 
   
In 1983, it was generally accepted knowledge that AIDS was at least indirectly sexually transmitted. However, it was the stigma and lack of education around this fact that made the frankness and sex-positivity ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' all the more important. The fact that the authors did not advocate for abstinence, were open to people's differing personal preferences, and emphasized that gay sex, anal-receptive sex in particular, was not dangerous or [[immoral]] in and of itself, made it much more effective and well-received by the gay community.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; According to [[Jeffrey Escoffier]], given that many members of the LGBT community saw gay sex as transgressive and [[Empowerment|empowering]], safe sex, particularly the use of condoms that had been traditionally seen as only necessary for [[heterosexual]] sex, was therefore a "normalization" of gay sex and a loss of [[Gay liberation|gay power]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Thus, safe sex education that did not detract from the [[uniqueness]] and power in gay sex was vital; Sonnabend himself recognizes that "perhaps the most valuable contribution of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was its ability to propose condom use in a manner that was able to celebrate sex."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

==Inaccuracies==
In 1981, when Sonnabend was formulating the multifactorial theory of HIV/AIDS transmission, the available [[data]] did not clearly [[disprove]] either his [[Scientific model|model]] or the new agent [[theory]], and there was no time to wait for the debate to be cleared up before offering concrete prevention methods.&lt;ref name=multi /&gt; It was widely accepted that AIDS was sexually transmitted, and the fraught political environment made both models unappealing for different reasons.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Sonnabend argued that "to propose without supporting evidence that any [[minority group|minority]] group might be carrying a potentially fatal new, [[mutant]] virus is unconscionable";&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; however, the multifactorial model also came under attack for being [[homophobic]] and [[moralistic]] in its approach to frequent and impersonal sex.&lt;ref&gt;''Armstrong, Elizabeth A.

Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt; Because the virus seemed almost entirely isolated to MSM in the early 1980s, it was difficult to see how and why a single virus would target a single demographic group. The new agent theory was adopted by the Gay Men's Health Crisis but was also, according to Callen and Berkowitz, a tool used by the [[Christian right|religious right]] to justify homophobia and dialogues condemning [[sex outside of marriage]], as well as a reflection of the "[[Western world|Western]] tradition of blaming [[Disaster|calamity]] on the [[Third World]]."&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=know&gt;Callen, Michael and Richard Berkowitz.

Despite the fact that ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was based on incomplete knowledge of the causes of AIDS, the advice given in the 40 pages was relevant to HIV/AIDS prevention, at least when it comes to sex-related modes of transmission.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Its central argument was to avoid getting semen and CMV in one's rectum, although, as the authors pointed out in the first section of the booklet, CMV could be substituted for the new, unidentified retrovirus that was hypothesized to cause AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

However, there are several instances in which the advice is inaccurate and no longer a part of [[safe sex]] education. The authors put more emphasis than necessary on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] argument—that there are inherent [[behavioral]] patterns in the MSM [[community]] responsible for causing AIDS—and failed to recognize that a single exposure could result in infection.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Under the multifactorial model, kissing a PWA, [[rimming]] and swallowing during oral sex all appear more risky than they actually are; on the other hand, having sex with a person with AIDS was more risky than the multifactorial theory suggested because a single contact can result in [[seroconversion]].&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; The multifactorial model was also unnecessarily critical of [[promiscuity]] (although the authors make sure to clarify that promiscuity is only problematic given high preexisting rates of STDs in the sexual network). In 2008, Sonnabend defended the pamphlet's focus on promiscuity, arguing that high quantities of unprotected sex were a "very significant health hazard" whether or not one put their faith in the multifactorial model, and, indeed, a high frequency of sexual encounters was still relevant given that it increased the probability of contact with an HIV+ person.&lt;ref name=trenches /&gt; 
 
The multifactorial model also gave the authors and their writing a certain degree of [[hope]] that the endpoint to AIDS was not necessarily [[death]] (which it seemed to be at the time): they believed that stopping exposure to semen and CMV after infection could improve the health of the infected individual.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=film /&gt; The [[asymptomatic]] latency period had not yet been defined, and accounts of people with AIDS, including Berkowitz himself, maintaining a relatively healthy [[standard of living]] post-[[diagnosis]] convinced the [[authors]] of the importance of continued use of protection among people with AIDS who have sex. As is now common knowledge, once one has been infected with HIV it is almost impossible to completely rid one's body of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;"HIV/AIDS." Planned Parenthood, 2017. https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hiv-aids. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the advice to continue using protection after being diagnosed was important in not only preventing future transmission to uninfected people but also to protecting the person with AIDS from being exposed to more pathogens through sex.

[[Historians]], as well as the authors themselves, recognize that the creation of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was only possible given their belief in the multifactorial model.&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;  Safe sex advocates would have been much less likely to propose condom use had they known that a single exposure was enough to contract HIV. For proponents of the single agent theory, "to suggest condom use would be tantamount to suggesting that one place a thin [[latex]] [[film]] between oneself and certain death," as Sonnabend put it.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Following the discovery of the HIV and the almost unanimous acceptance of the single agent theory in the scientific community, the authors have acknowledged the inaccuracies in their safe sex manual, while pointing out its continued importance.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

Berkowitz describes ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' as being more [[conservative]] than it needed to be, given that it operated on the sole [[principle]] that gay men should avoid getting sperm in their own or their partner's rectum without knowing the other's status.&lt;ref name=huff&gt;Adnum, Mark.

==Publication and Reception==

===Publication===
After the pamphlet went through numerous drafts and editions, Callen and Berkowitz had difficulty finding somewhere to publish it, given its controversial subject matter and point of view.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was rejected by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a prominent LGBT community health group that promoted the single virus theory, as well as by the state of New York when they reached out for help with publication. The authors collected donations from the LGBT community in New York City to fund the printing, and received a significant donation from philanthropist and HIV/AIDS activist Randall Klose.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Callen even contributed his own tax refund to the cause.&lt;ref name=andriote&gt;Andriote, John-Manuel.

===Reception===
====By the New York City LGBT community====
''How to Have Sex'' was met with a mixed response from its [[target audience]] ([[queer]] men/MSM) in New York City. Sales exceeded what the authors had expected, and within two weeks of the initial [[publication]] they had ordered a second batch, and, soon after, a third to meet popular [[demand]].&lt;ref name=france /&gt; David France describes himself and his [[friends]] being "absorbed" by the material: "the [[pool table]] sat idle as a [[dozen]] of us passed around copies, hungry for guidance through the [[terror]] that sex was causing."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; It has been lauded as the "first sex-positive guide to practicing safe sex" and is widely regarded as revolutionizing the tone of safe sex education, particularly in the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=andriote /&gt; The only real sacrifices in behavior that it required were abstaining from substance use in sex-related situations, rather than abstinence from any form of sex itself. Most readers reacted well to the positive and casual tone of the writing, as well as the frank descriptions of sexual acts. [[Edmund White]], author of ''The Joys of Gay Sex'', said of the pamphlet: "this is the sanest, most sensible advice I've read yet about AIDS" and [[Dennis Altman]], author of ''The Homosexualization of America'' said, "at last: a response to the effect of aids on our lives that goes beyond fears and myths to suggest positive actions."&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz, Richard. "4. How to Have Sex in an Epidemic." ''Safe Sex Positive.'' Wordpress, 29 June 2010. https://richardberkowitz.com/category/4-how-to-have-sex-in-an-epidemic/&lt;/ref&gt; David France called it "a survival [[guide]] for the plague years."&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Many gay men were simply glad for any concrete advice in the midst of such confusion, particularly advice that did not present celibacy as the only safe option.

====Controversy====
As expected, ''How to Have Sex'' did receive significant [[criticism]] from other gay men and [[gay organizations]] for its critical take on promiscuity. Callen and Berkowitz had attempted to tone down their critical tone from their first major publication, "We Know Who We Are: Two Gay Men Declare War on Promiscuity" in a 1982 issue of the New York Native, which had harshly condemned the "excessiveness" and "pigging out" that was occurring in the gay nightclub scene.&lt;ref name=know /&gt; They incorporate consistent affirmation of gay sex throughout the forty pages, including sentences like the following:&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

{{quote|As you read on, we hope we make at least one point clear: Sex doesn't make you sick — diseases do. Gay sex doesn't make you sick — gay men who are sick do.}}

Many gay community members and leaders saw the writing in ''How to Have Sex'' as moralistic and attributed the advice against some types of sex to internalized homophobia, [[self-hatred]] and an "anti-sexual sense of guilt."&lt;ref name=ACTUP /&gt; A response written by Michael Lynch and Bill Lewis in the Toronto Politic, a Canadian gay newspaper, criticized Callen and Berkowitz for blowing the epidemic out of proportion and allowing the medical community to "pathologize" gay men, and the authors faced frequent accusations of [[victim-blaming]] and siding with the religious right.&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was not an easy message for some gay men to receive: in an interview for Berkowitz' biographical film, Sex Positive, Larry Kramer described it as a blast of "cold [[water]] in the [[face]]."&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

However, all three authors firmly believed in the importance of disseminating their message despite negative reactions. Callen wrote in his book ''Surviving AIDS'' that "to be attacked for trying to save the lives of others was deeply wounding. But we felt we had no choice."&lt;ref&gt;Callen, Michael. ''Surviving AIDS.'' HarperCollins, first edition (November 1, 1990). {{ISBN|0060161485}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnabend argued that [[political correctness]] and the "desire to be nonjudgemental" were beginning to interfere with [[medical practitioners]]' primary commitment to take care of their patients and was becoming a public health issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sonnabend, Joseph. "Promiscuity is bad for your health." ''The New York Native,'' September 13–26, 1982. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Callen even applauded the negative responses to their advocacy published in [[the New York Native]], because it ended up causing debate and dramatically widening the [[audience]] and popularity of ''How to Have Sex'' in an Epidemic. "It turns out historically to have been one of the advantages of our status as [[heretics]]," he was quoted saying in ''[[How to Survive a Plague]].''&lt;ref name=france /&gt;

Callen and Berkowitz do address the personal and [[political]] implications of their safe sex advice, specifically the loss of [[autonomy]] and [[joy]] the community might experience from having to [[police]] sexual behavior. In "We Know Who We Are" they wrote:&lt;ref name=know /&gt;

{{quote|ultimately, it may be more important to let people die in pursuit of their own [[happiness]] than to limit personal [[freedom]] by regulating risk.}}

====By the straight community====
In his memoir, Berkowitz wrote, "there was little chance we would water down our safe sex [[manifesto]] to make it more presentable for the general public in the [[Reagan era]]."&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;  Although he and Callen both stressed that ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was not intended for [[Heterosexuality|straight]] audiences, its popularity and importance as a foundational safe sex manifesto ensured that it got at least some level of attention beyond the LGBT community of New York City. According to the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] archives, the pamphlet was purchased by numerous [[public libraries]] (twelve known examples) and [[universities]], as well as seven known [[high schools]], a surprising number of which were in traditionally conservative states that still had functioning [[sodomy laws]].&lt;ref name=blah&gt;Oliver, Chris. "Who was reading 'How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'?" London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Archives, 12 December 2014. http://blogs.lshtm.ac.uk/library/2014/12/12/reading-sex-epidemic/. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The frank description of gay sex did not seem to dissuade more mainstream [[institutions]], although it is unclear whether they were aware of the [[Sexually explicit|explicit]] content of the manual before purchasing it.

The primary readership of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was still gay men in New York City, but knowledge of the work spread to people of all sexualities around the country, and even, in some cases, [[internationally]]. Soon after its initial publication, the booklet was given a review in the [[New York Review of Books]], and later a [[newscaster]] came from [[West Germany]] to interview the authors about their work.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberson, Jonathan. "Anatomy of an Epidemic." The New York Review of Books, 18 August 1983. http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1983/08/18/anatomy-of-an-epidemic/.

==Historical significance==
Social scientists have credited ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' and a 1982 pamphlet called ''Play Fair!'' by the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] as the first literature to recommend safe sex as a strategy for reducing the risk of contracting the transmitting agent which causes AIDS.&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petro, Anthony M.''After the Wrath of God: AIDS, Sexuality, and American Religion.'' Oxford University Press; first edition (July 1, 2015). {{ISBN|0199391289}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar AIDS education manual, entitled "Can We Talk?" was published by the [[Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club]] in San Francisco at the beginning of 1983, although it is less often credited as being foundational for safe sex.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"AIDS Prevention Flyers: Can We Talk?", Pacific Oregon University Archives. http://exhibits.lib.pacificu.edu/items/show/940. Retrieved 13 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===For HIV/AIDS Activism and Gay Politics===
Despite the negative press that ''How to Have Sex'' received for what many perceived as a criticism of promiscuity, many [[Queer theory|queer theorists]] have acknowledged the importance of the pamphlet and others like it to the evolution of the broader [[LGBT rights movement]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=ACTUP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowsett, Gary W. ''Practicing Desire: Homosexual Sex in the Era of AIDS.'' [[Stanford University Press]], first edition (November 1, 1996). {{ISBN|0804727112}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The politics at the time were fraught, and the AIDS epidemic revealed what Callen and Berkowitz described as the danger of having "a positive political force [i.e. the LGBT liberation] tied to a dangerous lifestyle [i.e. promiscuity without condom use]."&lt;ref name=know /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/799651 |jstor=799651 |title=Gay Baths and the Social Organization of Impersonal Sex |journal=Social Problems |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=124 |year=1975 |last1=Weinberg |first1=Martin S |last2=Williams |first2=Colin J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint presented in the booklet is one that attempted to challenge the institutions that had arisen in the urban gay male community, including bathhouses and backrooms, that had an [[economic]] "stake in keeping us promiscuous," according to the authors.&lt;ref name=know /&gt; There was a common notion in the community at the time that STDs were supposed to be what [[Edmund White]] called "[[red]] [[badges]] of [[courage]] in a [[war]] against a sex negative society," but as the cost of life from these diseases rose, members of that same community saw the need to change practices to make sex safer, and ''How to Have Sex'' is a result of that phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Tammy. ''The Death of Right and Wrong.'' Crown Forum, Reprint edition (June 22, 2004). {{ISBN|1400052947}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/136345930100500103 |title=Gay Men and HIV/AIDS Risk Management |journal=Health: an Interdisciplinary Journal for the Social Study of Health, Illness and Medicine |volume=5 |pages=50 |year=2016 |last1=Flowers |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is part of the shift in behavior and mentality from the 70s to the 80s resulting directly from the AIDS epidemic.&lt;ref name=law /&gt;&lt;ref name=ncbistudy /&gt; The following quote from "We Know Who We Are" demonstrates the authors' call to action:&lt;ref name=know /&gt;
{{quote|The [[motto]] of promiscuous gay men has been 'so many men, so little time.' In the `70s we worried about so many men; in the `80s we will have to worry about so little time. For us, the party that was the `70s is over. For some, perhaps, homosexuality may always mean promiscuity. They may very well die for that belief. The last 13 years since [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] have demonstrated tremendous change. So must the next 13 years.}}

===For the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement===
{{main|People with AIDS}}
Along with buddy programs, [[The Denver Principles]], the San Francisco model of care, and [[activism]] occurring around the country, pamphlets like ''How to have Sex'' and ''Play Fair!'' have been described as key elements of the [[People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement]].&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2013.301381 |pmid=23948013 |pmc=3780739 |title=Only Your Calamity: The Beginnings of Activism by and for People with AIDS |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=103 |issue=10 |pages=1788–98 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=Joe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt; Sonnabend called the method presented in the manual a "do it yourself" approach that "did not wait for others to take care of pressing needs."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; As Berkowitz explained, having the power to control one's [[sex life]] and to prevent oneself from getting sick was the essence of [[self-empowerment]] at a time when AIDS was taking away gay men's [[sexual freedom]] and ability to enact a [[rebellion]] against heteronormativity through sex.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

===For Safe Sex===
{{main|Sex positive movement}}
Along with Play Fair!, ''How to have Sex'' was among the first safe sex educational materials produced and widely disseminated that addressed the subject in a positive and affirming light.&lt;ref&gt;King, Edward. ''Safety in Numbers: Safer Sex and Gay Men.'' Routledge, first edition (April 27, 1994). {{ISBN|0415909317}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; David France described the authors' method and aims to modify the behaviors of an entire [[subculture]] as something so radical that, had they discussed its feasibility with [[social scientists]] beforehand, they might have been dissuaded from attempting it.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; That said, Berkowitz has lamented that the grassroots origins of safe sex were rapidly forgotten as it became increasingly touted as an invention from experts in the scientific community.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

===For Public Health===
''How to Have Sex'' in an Epidemic is evidence of a larger trend occurring in the 1980s and 1990s in which the impetus for [[Therapy|treatment]] and [[preventive healthcare|prevention]] for HIV/AIDS came directly from the [[People With AIDS|infected communities]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=law /&gt; As Alan Brandt argues, the AIDS epidemic did more than any other to blur the line between the healthcare field and the people they treated; community-based care became a central model for public and global health efforts related to this particular disease.&lt;ref name=brandt&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1305297 |pmid=23738542 |title=How AIDS Invented Global Health |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=368 |issue=23 |pages=2149–52 |year=2013 |last1=Brandt |first1=Allan M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have recognized the importance of "[[vernacular]] knowledge" from within the gay community, such as the vocabulary used in ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' being brought into a broader [[epidemiological]]/scientific context, because it was this intimate knowledge of sexual behavior among MSM that gave Callen and Berkowitz the authority to address the subject and the ability to do so in a way that appealed to their audience and avoided condescension.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Queer theorist [[Douglas Crimp]] wrote:&lt;ref name=prom /&gt; 

{{quote|We [gay men] were able to invent safe sex because we have always known that sex is not, in an [[epidemic]] or not, limited to [[penetrative sex]]. Our promiscuity taught us many things, not only about the [[pleasures]] of sex, but about the great multiplicity of those pleasures.}}

On a practical level, this sort of grassroots prevention advocacy was necessary because, in the early years of the epidemic when little was known about transmission and AIDS [[panic]] was highly prevalent, many [[mainstream]] medical [[institutions]] refused to offer care to [[people with AIDS]] or did so in a substandard manner.&lt;ref&gt;"When Doctors Refuse to Treat AIDS." ''[[The New York Times]],'' August 3, 1987. https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/03/opinion/when-doctors-refuse-to-treat-aids.html. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chambré, Susan Maizel. ''Fighting for Our Lives: New York's AIDS Community and the Politics of Disease.'' [[Rutgers University Press]], annotated edition (August 21, 2006). {{ISBN|081353867X}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the booklet itself and the partnership of the contributors (i.e., between Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend) helped lay the foundation for greater [[collaboration]] between [[scientists]] and the affected communities they study.&lt;ref name=brandt /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

''How to have Sex in an Epidemic'' was an important medical text in that it gave straight [[healthcare professionals]] and mainstream institutions more in depth knowledge of gay culture in general, and sexual culture of MSM specifically, including a variety of niche sex acts. This information was critical for [[Medical practitioner|practitioner]]s and [[researchers]] in their attempts to understand the risks associated with contracting HIV.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

'''Lester Lawrence Lessig III''' (born June 3, 1961) is an American academic, attorney, and [[political activist]]. He is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at [[Harvard Law School]] and the former director of the [[Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10519/Lessig/|title=Harvard Law School Faculty Lawrence Lessig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig was a [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|candidate]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s nomination for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], but withdrew before the primaries.

Lessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on [[copyright]], [[trademark]], and [[radio frequency]] spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded [[Creative Commons]], a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at [[Stanford Law School]], where he founded the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]], and at the [[University of Chicago]]. He is a former board member of the [[Free Software Foundation]] and [[Software Freedom Law Center]]; the Washington, D.C. lobbying groups [[Public Knowledge]] and [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]]; and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Lawrence.

==Academic career==
Lessig earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in economics and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in management ([[Wharton School]]) from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] degree in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]) in England, and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1989. After graduating from law school, he [[Law clerk|clerked]] for a year for Judge [[Richard Posner]], at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and another year for Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] at the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence |first=Lessig |title=Curriculum Vitae |url=http://www.lessig.org/info/resume/ |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707013742/http://www.lessig.org/info/resume/ |archivedate=July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig started his academic career at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he was professor from 1991 to 1997. As co-director of the Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe there, he helped the newly-independent [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] draft a constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/951207/georgia.shtml|title=Center helps Eastern European countries shape constitutions|publisher=|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2000, he was at [[Harvard Law School]], holding for a year the chair of Berkman Professor of Law, affiliated with the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]].&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt; He subsequently joined [[Stanford Law School]], where he established the school's [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]].&lt;ref name="short-bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence |first=Lessig |title=Short Biography |url=http://www.lessig.org/info/bio// |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722035945/http://www.lessig.org/info/bio/ |archivedate=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig returned to Harvard in July 2009 as professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics.&lt;ref name="hl-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence Lessig named professor of law at HLS, director of Harvard's Edmond J.

===In popular culture===
Lessig was portrayed by [[Christopher Lloyd]] in "[[The Wake Up Call]]", during season 6 of ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2005/02/09/lessig-portrayed-on.html|title=Lessig portrayed on tonight's West Wing|work=Boing Boing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background==
[[File:Jonathan Zittrain and Lawrence Lessig (Google DC, March 20 2008).jpg|thumbnail|Lessig speaking with Harvard internet law professor [[Jonathan Zittrain]]]]
Lessig has been politically [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] since studying philosophy at Cambridge in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, two influential [[Conservatism|conservative]] judges, Judge [[Richard Posner]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], selected him to serve as a law clerk, choosing him for his supposed "brilliance" rather than for his ideology and effectively making him the "token liberal" on their staffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2010/09/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-how-political-is-it/|title=Supreme Court Clerk Hiring: Is It Becoming More Political?|work=Above the Law|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posner would later call him "the most distinguished law professor of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/lessig_pr.html|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|author=Steven Levy|date=October 1, 2002|work=WIRED|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of [[Teenage Republicans]], served as the Youth Governor for Pennsylvania through the [[YMCA Youth and Government]] program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymcapa.org/ |title=YMCA Youth and Government Pennsylvania (PA State YMCA) |publisher=Ymcapa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1978, and almost pursued a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political career.

What was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy and develop his changed political values. During this time, he also traveled in the [[Eastern Bloc]], where he acquired a lifelong interest in [[Eastern Europe]]an law and politics.

Lessig remains skeptical of government intervention but favors some regulation, calling himself "a constitutionalist." On one occasion, Lessig also commended the [[John McCain]] campaign for discussing [[fair use]] rights in a letter to [[YouTube]] where it took issue with YouTube for indulging overreaching copyright claims leading to the removal of various campaign videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/mccainpalin_to_youtube_get_rea.html |title=McCain/Palin to YouTube: Get real (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521070933/http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/mccainpalin_to_youtube_get_rea.html |archivedate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and computer activism==
[[File:Lawrence lessig, joi ito.jpg|thumbnail|Lessig with fellow Creative Commons board member [[Joi Ito]]]]

==="Code is law"===
In computer science, "code" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the [[source code]]). In law, "code" can refer to the texts that constitute [[statutory law]]. In his 1999 book ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]]'', Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for [[social control]], leading to his dictum that "Code is law." Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as ''[[Code: Version 2.0]]'' in December 2006.

===Remix culture===
Lessig has been a proponent of the [[remix culture]] since the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2004_fall/lessig.htm |date=2004-11-18 |accessdate=2016-02-27 |title=Remix Is a Cultural Right, Lessig Says |publisher=law.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2008 book [[Remix (book)|''Remix'']]&lt;ref&gt;[http://remix.lessig.org/remix.php Remix] on lessig.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix Remix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402060619/https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix |date=April 2, 2016 }} on [[scribd.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; he presents this as a desirable cultural practice distinct from piracy. Lessig further articulates remix Culture as intrinsic to technology and the Internet. Remix culture is therefore an amalgam of practice, creativity, "read/write" culture and the hybrid economy.

According to Lessig, the problem with the remix comes when it is at odds with stringent US copyright law. He has compared this to the failure of [[Prohibition]], both in its ineffectiveness and in its tendency to normalize criminal behavior. Instead he proposes more lenient licensing, namely [[Creative Commons license]]s, as a remedy to maintain "rule of law" while combating plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/778455386|title=The social media reader|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|publisher=New York University Press|others=Mandiberg, Michael,|year=2012|isbn=9780814764077|location=New York|pages=155–169|chapter=REMIX: How Creativity is Being Strangled by the Law|oclc=778455386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free culture===
[[File:Aaron Swartz and Lawrence Lessig.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lessig and [[Aaron Swartz]] in 2002 at the launch party for [[Creative Commons]]]]
On March 28, 2004 he was elected to the FSF's board of directors.&lt;ref name="Fsf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/about/leadership.html |title=Leadership – Free Software Foundation |publisher=Fsf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of "[[Free-culture movement|free culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/ |title=free_culture |publisher=Randomfoo.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supports [[free and open-source software]] and [[open spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/spectrum/ |title=Spectrum Policy: Property or Commons? |publisher=Cyberlaw.stanford.edu |date=2003-03-02 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his free culture keynote at the [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention]] 2002, a few minutes of his speech was about [[software patent]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/|title=free_culture|work=randomfoo.net}} Lessig discusses software patents from time 17:38 to 20:38 of the audio recording&lt;/ref&gt; which he views as a rising threat to [[free software]], [[open source software]] and innovation.

In March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the [[Digital Universe]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-14-2006/0004319554&amp;EDATE= |title=Digital Universe Adds Leading Internet Expert Lawrence Lessig to Board of Advisors |location=California |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 [[Wikimania]] conference. In December 2006, his lecture '' On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code'' was one of the highlights at [[Chaos Communication Congress|23C3 ''Who can you trust?'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/hmdmhdfmhdjmzdtjmzdtzktdkztdjz/commons |title=commons |year=2011 |id=google video docid=7661663613180520595 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig claimed in 2009 that, because 70% of young people obtain digital information from illegal sources, the law should be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Lawrence Lessig |title=Colbert Nation |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215454/january-08-2009/lawrence-lessig |publisher=Comedy Central |date=January 8, 2009 |time=2:16 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a foreword to the [[Freesouls]] book project, Lessig makes an argument in favor of amateur artists in the world of digital technologies: "there is a different class of amateur creators that digital technologies have&amp;nbsp;... enabled, and a different kind of creativity has emerged as a consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freesouls.cc/essays/00-foreword-lawrence-lessig.html|title=Freesouls - Foreword by Lawrence Lessig|work=freesouls.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig is also a well-known critic of [[copyright term]] extensions.

===Net neutrality===
[[File:Lessig-Wales-20070615.jpg|thumb|Lessig and [[Jimmy Wales]] at the iCommons iSummit07 in [[Dubrovnik]]]]
Lessig has long been known to be a supporter of [[net neutrality]]. In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify [[Michael Powell (attorney)|Michael Powell]]'s four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, "Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong."&lt;ref&gt;CBC NEWS. Google accused of turning its back on net neutrality. December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative reform===
Despite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that creative professionals' work, many of them independent, would become more easily and quickly available if bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Clark. Software Freedom Fighters. ''The National Journal'' 33(30), July 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lessig has repeatedly taken a stance that privatization through legislation like that seen in the 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications is not the best way to help the Internet grow. He said, "When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place," "My claim is that we should focus on the values of liberty. If there is not government to insist on those values, then who?" "The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Mills. Domain games: Internet leaves the U.S. nest. ''InfoWorld Daily News''. October 13, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}{{See also|Eldred v. Ashcroft}}
From 1999 to 2002, Lessig represented a high-profile challenge the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]]. Working with the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]], Lessig led the team representing the plaintiff in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/10/lessig-3/|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff in the case was joined by a group of publishers who frequently published work in the [[Public domain in the United States|public domain]] and a large number of ''[[Amicus curiae|amici]]'' including the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[American Association of Law Libraries]], the [[Bureau of National Affairs]], and the [[College Art Association]].

In March 2003, Lessig acknowledged severe disappointment with his Supreme Court defeat in the Eldred copyright-extension case, where he unsuccessfully tried to convince Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had sympathies for de-regulation, to back his "market-based" approach to intellectual property regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig Backs Away From Copy Fights In Courts, Congress.

In October 2014, ''Killswitch'', a film featuring Lawrence Lessig, as well as [[Aaron Swartz]], [[Tim Wu]], and [[Edward Snowden]] received its World Premiere at the [[Woodstock Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best Editing. In the film, Lessig frames the story of two young hacktivists, Swartz and Snowden, who symbolize the disruptive and dynamic nature of the Internet. The film reveals the emotional bond between Lessig and Swartz, and how it was Swartz (the mentee) that challenged Lessig (the mentor) to engage in the political activism that has led to Lessig's crusade for [[campaign finance reform]].&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite news |last1=von Busack |first1=Richard |title=Breaking the Internet: Killswitch Screens at Cinequest |url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/cinequest-2015/Killswitch-Edward-Snowden.html |date=February 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |publisher=Metro Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocreg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Swegles |first1=Fred |title=Battle for Internet Control Fuels O.C. -produced Movie |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/film-657978-internet-big.html/ |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 16, 2015 |publisher=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, ''Killswitch'' was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington DC by Congressman [[Alan Grayson]]. The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on [[Net Neutrality]]. Lessig, Congressman Grayson, and [[Free Press (organization)]] CEO Craig Aaron spoke about the importance of protecting net neutrality and the free and open Internet.&lt;ref name="house1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grayson |first1=Alan |title=Grayson Screen Award Winning "Killswitch" Documentary |url=http://grayson.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/330-grayson-screens-award-winning-killswitch-documentary |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |publisher=Congressman Grayson's House of Rep Official Web Page |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227162553/http://grayson.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/330-grayson-screens-award-winning-killswitch-documentary |archivedate=February 27, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Price That You Pay for Rocking The Boat |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-alan-grayson/aaron-swartz-killswitch_b_6957576.html |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Grayson states that Killswitch is "One of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet -- and access to information itself.".&lt;ref name="house1"/&gt; [[Richard von Busack]] of the [[Metro Silicon Valley]], writes of ''Killswitch'', "Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Café".&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; Fred Swegles of the [[Orange County Register]], remarks, "Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by ''Killswitch'', a gripping and fast-paced documentary."&lt;ref name="ocreg"/&gt; Kathy Gill of [[GeekWire]] asserts that "''Killswitch'' is much more than a dry recitation of technical history.

===The Electors Trust===

==Money in politics activism==
[[File:Jack Abramoff and Lawrence Lessig at "In the Dock" 2011 (2).jpg|thumbnail|right|Lessig having a discussion with former lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]]]]
At the iCommons iSummit 07, Lessig announced that he would stop focusing his attention on copyright and related matters and work on [[political corruption]] instead, as the result of a transformative conversation with [[Aaron Swartz]], a young internet prodigy whom Lessig met through his work with [[Creative Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/required_reading_the_next_10_y_1.html |title=Required Reading: the next 10 years (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116071137/http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/required_reading_the_next_10_y_1.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new work was partially facilitated through his [[wiki]], Lessig Wiki, which he has encouraged the public to use to document cases of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/just_because_im_not_working_do.html |title=Lessig's blog July 29, 2007 11:55pm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015180516/http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/just_because_im_not_working_do.html |archivedate=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig criticized the [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] phenomenon in which legislators and staffers leave office to become [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbyists]] and have become beholden to special interests.&lt;ref name=twsDecM9009&gt;{{cite news |author=Lawrence Lessig |title=How to Get Our Democracy Back

In February 2008, a [[Facebook]] group formed by law professor [[John Palfrey]] encouraged him to run for Congress from [[California's 12th congressional district]], the seat vacated by the death of U.S. Representative [[Tom Lantos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://draftlessig.org/ |title=Draft Lessig – Change Congress |publisher=Draftlessig.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, after forming an "exploratory project", he decided not to run for the vacant seat.&lt;ref name="blog-notrunning"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://www.lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html |title=On why I am not running (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116042748/http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rootstrikers===
{{Main|Rootstrikers}}
Despite having decided to forgo running for Congress himself, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption.&lt;ref name="blog-notrunning" /&gt; To this end, he worked with political consultant [[Joe Trippi]] to launch a web based project called "[[Change Congress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/stanford-law-pr.html |title=Stanford Law Professor Larry Lessig Bets 'Wikipedia' Approach Will Transform Congress &amp;#124; Threat Level from Wired.com |publisher=Blog.wired.com |date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference on March 20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress website would help provide technological tools voters could use to hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of money on politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visualwebcaster.com/event.asp?id=46510 |title=Sunlight Foundation Webcast |publisher=Visualwebcaster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a board member of [[MAPLight.org]], a nonprofit research group illuminating the connection between money and politics.

[[Change Congress]] later became ''Fix Congress First'', and was finally named [[Rootstrikers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootstrikers.org/whoweare.php Who We Are] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223040848/https://www.rootstrikers.org/whoweare.php |date=December 23, 2011 }}, Rootstrikers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootstrikers.org/about.php About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111155608/https://www.rootstrikers.org/about.php |date=January 11, 2012 }}, Rootstrikers&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Lessig announced that Rootstrikers would join forces with [[Dylan Ratigan]]'s ''Get Money Out'' campaign, under the umbrella of the United Republic organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitedrepublic.org/2011/rootstrikers-and-united-republic/ Rootstrikers and United Republic], Lawrence Lessig, United Republic, November 16, 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230017/http://unitedrepublic.org/2011/rootstrikers-and-united-republic/ |date=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitedrepublic.org/about-us About Us], United Republic {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207223737/http://unitedrepublic.org/about-us |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rootstrikers subsequently came under the aegis of [[Demand Progress]], an organization co-founded by Aaron Swartz.

===Article V convention===
[[File:Lawrence Lessig 2.jpg|thumbnail|Lessig speaking before [[Change Congress]] and the [[Sunlight Foundation]]]]
{{main|Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution}}

In 2010, Lessig began to organize for a national Article V convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.callaconvention.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206220707/http://www.callaconvention.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 6, 2010 |title=Call a Convention |publisher=Call a Convention |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded ''Fix Congress First!'' with [[Joe Trippi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fixcongressfirst.org/about/ About], Fix Congress First!&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech in 2011, Lessig revealed that he was disappointed with Obama's performance in office, criticizing it as a "betrayal", and he criticized the president for using "the (Hillary) Clinton playbook".&lt;ref name=twsDecM4j8767s&gt;{{cite news |author=Lawrence Lessig |title= Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It |publisher= ''Google, YouTube, Huffington Post''

===New Hampshire Rebellion===
The [[Coalition for Open Democracy|New Hampshire Rebellion]] is a walk to raise awareness about corruption in politics.&lt;ref name="atlantic-2014"&gt;Lawrence Lessig, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-were-marching-across-new-hampshire-to-honor-aaron-swartz/282962/ "Why We're Marching Across New Hampshire to Honor Aaron Swartz"], ''The Atlantic'', January 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Harper, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/inside-the-beltway-self-awareness-and-the-science-/?page=all "Restless grassroots: New Hampshire 'Rebellion' declares their state is not for sale"] (Inside the Beltway column), ''Washington Times'', December 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;John Koziol, [http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150118/NEWS06/150119165 "NH Rebellion Marching Its Way to Concord for Reform"], ''New Hampshire Union Leader'', January 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 11 to 24, 2014, Lessig and many others, like New York activist [[Jeff Kurzon]], marched from [[Dixville Notch, New Hampshire]] to Nashua (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling "the systemic corruption in Washington".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Lessig chose this language over the related term "campaign finance reform," commenting that "Saying we need campaign finance reform is like referring to an alcoholic as someone who has a liquid intake problem."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The walk was to continue the work of NH Native [[Doris Haddock|Doris "Granny D" Haddock]], and in honor of deceased activist [[Aaron Swartz]].&lt;ref name="atlantic-2014" /&gt; The New Hampshire Rebellion marched 16 miles from Hampton to New Castle on the New Hampshire Seacoast.&lt;ref name="vasseur"&gt;Flore Vasseur, [https://medium.com/backchannel/larry-lessigs-long-walk-b96d80d34972 "The New Hampshire Rebellion: Larry Lessig's Long Walk"], ''The Medium'', December 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial location was also chosen because of its important and visible role in the quadrennial "New Hampshire primaries", the traditional first primary of the presidential election.&lt;ref name="vasseur" /&gt;

==2016 presidential candidacy==
{{main|Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016}}
Lessig announced the launch of his presidential campaign on September 6, 2015.
On August 11, 2015, Lessig announced that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|nomination]] for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref name="why"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exploring"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/11/politics/larry-lessig-presidential-campaign-exploration/index.html | title=Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig is exploring a long shot presidential bid | publisher=CNN.com | date=August 11, 2015 | accessdate=August 11, 2015 | author=Merica, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by [[Labor Day]] 2015.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt; The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Kristin (August 11, 2015) [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/2015/08/11/harvard-law-professor-exploring-presidential-run/lNQdSFZzDpMzCh0Uinz2aO/story.html "Harvard law professor wants to be president—for one day"], [[Boston.com]]. Retrieved August 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign was focused on a single issue: [[The Citizen Equality Act]], a proposal that couples [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] with other laws aimed at curbing [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering]] and ensuring [[Voter suppression in the United States|voting access]].&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt; As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt;

He announced the end of his campaign on November 2, 2015.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/2016-election/384828/|title=The 2016 U.S. Presidential Race: A Cheat Sheet|last=Graham|first=David|date=2 November 2015|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Lessig was appointed [[special master]] by Judge [[Thomas Penfield Jackson]] in 1997; the appointment was vacated by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/199806/97-5343a.txt |title=USCA-DC Opinions – Released On 1/21/2011 |publisher=Pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the appellate court ruled that the powers granted to Lessig exceeded the scope of the Federal statute providing for special masters; Judge Jackson then solicited Lessig's [[amicus brief]]
** Lessig said about this appointment: "Did Justice Jackson pick me to be his special master because he had determined I was the perfect mix of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Holmes]], and [[Ed Felten]]? No, I was picked because I was a Harvard Law Professor teaching the law of cyberspace.

'''Maniammai''' (10 March 1917 – 16 March 1978) was an activist and rationalist leader from [[Tamil Nadu]]. She was also the adopted daughter and life partner of [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]], and succeeded him as the leader of the [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] upon his death in 1973. She is considered the first woman political leader from the state.

==Biography==
Maniammai was born as Gandhimathi to Kanagasabai Mudaliar who was a party member of the [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]].&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tamiltribune.com/05/1201.html|title=Periyar Drops a Bombshell|last=Nalankilli|first=Thanjai|newspaper=Tamil tribune|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after her father's death, she was adopted by [[Periyar E.

'''''Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority ''''' (1986) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61984CJ0152 Case 152/84] is an [[EU law]] case, concerning the conflict of law between a national legal system and European Union law.

==Facts==
Helen Marshall, a senior dietitian, claimed that her dismissal on grounds of being old violated the [[Equal Treatment Directive 1976]]. She was an employee of an Area Health Authority (or "AHA"), a body established by the UK government under the [[National Health Service Act 1977]], as amended by the [[Health Services Act 1980]].

Marshall was dismissed after 14 years on 31 March 1980, approximately four weeks after attaining the age of 62, despite her expressing a willingness to continue in employment until the age of 65 (4 February 1983). The sole reason for her dismissal was that she had passed 'the retirement age'; the AHA’s policy was to make women compulsorily retire at 60, but men at 65.

Section 27 (1) and 28 (1) of the Social Security Act 1975 provided state pensions were to be granted to men at 65 and woman at 60, though notably did not impose any obligation to retire at the age at which the state pension becomes payable. 

The AHA were able to waive the term, which was deemed an implied term of Marshall's contract of employment and had done so for a further two years after she attained the age of 60. 

Given Marshall suffered financial loss, namely the difference between her earnings as an employee and her pension, and since she lost the satisfaction gained from work she initiated proceedings before an industrial tribunal, contending her dismissal constituted discriminatory treatment on the ground of sex, contrary to the sexual discrimination act and community law. The tribunal dismissed the claim in so far as it was based on infringement of the sexual discrimination act, since s 6 (4) permits discrimination of the grounds of sex in regards to retirement. However the claim on the basis that the principle of equal treatment laid down by directive 76/207 was upheld. 

The employment appeal tribunal affirmed the industrial tribunal on the first point, yet set aside the decision on the second point, on the basis that an individual had no ''[[locus standi]]'' and could not rely upon such a violation in proceedings before a United Kingdom court or tribunal. 

The English Court of Appeal found the Area Health Authority an ‘emanation of the State’, observing that the AHA respondent was constituted under s.8(1) of the [[National Health Service Act 1977]]. The Court made reference of two questions for [[preliminary ruling]] to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ): 
*First, whether the respondent's dismissal on the grounds that she was a woman who had passed the normal retiring age was an act of discrimination prohibited by the Directive. 
*Secondly, if the answer to the first is affirmative, whether or not the equal treatment directive can be relied upon by the appellant in the circumstances in national courts or tribunals, not withstanding the inconsistency, if any, between the Directive and the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]].

==Judgment==

===Advocate General Opinion===
[[Advocate General#Other European jurisdictions|Advocate General]] [[Lord Slynn|Slynn]] argued the ‘state’ should be construed broadly, to cover all organs, saying that insinuating ‘[[Direct effect of European Union law#Varieties of direct effect|horizontal effect]]’&lt;ref&gt;Horizontal direct effect concerns the relationship between individuals (including companies). If a certain provision of EU law is horizontally directly effective, then citizens are able to rely on it in actions against each other. Directives are usually incapable of being horizontally directly effective. Certain provisions of the treaties and legislative acts such as regulations are capable of being directly enforced horizontally.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vertical direct effect concerns the relationship between EU law and national law – specifically, the state's obligation to ensure its observance and its compatibility with EU law, thereby enabling citizens to rely on it in actions against the state or against public bodies; an "emanation of the state" as defined in [[Foster v. British Gas plc]].&lt;/ref&gt; into directives would ‘totally blur the distinction between EU directives and regulations'.

===Court of Justice===
The [[ECJ]], in a full court of 13 judges, held there was no horizontal direct effect. It does not matter what capacity a state is acting. Thus it fell to enquire whether the NHS should be deemed an "independent legal person" or an "arm of the state"; and that was a matter for the national court.

{{Cquote|48. ... according to article 189 of the EEC Treaty the binding nature of a directive, which constitutes the basis for the possibility of relying on the directive before a national court, exists only in relation to 'each member state to which it is addressed'. It follows that a directive may not of itself impose obligations on an individual and that a provision of a directive may not be relied on as such against such a person.
 
49. ... In either case it is necessary to prevent the State from taking advantage of its own failure to comply with Union law.}}

===English Court of Appeal===
This case involved an application for a preliminary ruling. Once the ECJ had answered the question, their decision was remitted to the reconvened Court of Appeal (which in the interim had adjourned this case). The Court of Appeal was then obliged to reach a decision in the light of the ECJ ruling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22681">'''Mobilities''' is a contemporary [[paradigm]] in the [[social science]]s that explores the movement of people ([[Human migration]], [[travel]], [[transport]]), ideas (see e.g. [[meme]]) and things (transport), as well as the broader social implications of those movements.

A mobility "turn" (or transformation) in the social sciences began in the 1990s in response to the increasing realization of the historic and contemporary importance of movement on individuals and society. This turn has been driven by generally increased levels of mobility and new forms of mobility where bodies combine with information and different patterns of mobility. The mobilities paradigm incorporates new ways of theorizing about how these mobilities lie "at the center of constellations of power, the creation of identities and the microgeographies of everyday life." ([[Tim Cresswell|Cresswell]], 2011, 551)

The mobility turn arose as a response to the way in which the social sciences had traditionally been static, seeing movement as a [[black box]] and ignoring or trivializing "the importance of the systematic movements of people for work and family life, for leisure and pleasure, and for politics and protest" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 208). Mobilities emerged as a critique of contradictory orientations toward both [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentarism]] and deterritorialisation in social science. People had often been seen as static entities tied to specific places, or as [[nomad]]ic and placeless in a frenetic and [[globalization|globalized]] existence. Mobilities looks at movements and the forces that drive, constrain and are produced by those movements.

Several typologies have been formulated to clarify the wide variety of mobilities. Most notably, John Urry&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. 2000 Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century. London:  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J., 2007. Mobilities. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; divides mobilities into five types: mobility of objects, corporeal mobility, imaginative mobility, virtual mobility and communicative mobility. Later, Leopoldina Fortunati and Sakari Taipale&lt;ref&gt;Fortunati, L. &amp; Taipale, S. 2017. Mobilities and the Network of Personal Technologies: Refining the Understanding of Mobility Structure. Telematics and Informatics, 34(2), 560–568. https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.09.011 &lt;/ref&gt; proposed an alternative typology taking the individual and the human body as a point of reference. They differentiate between ‘macro-mobilities’ (consistent physical displacements), ‘micro-mobilities’ (small-scale displacements), ‘media mobility’ (mobility added to the traditionally fixed forms of media) and ‘disembodied mobility’ (the transformation in the social order). The categories are typically considered interrelated, and therefore they are not exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Taipale, S. 2013.

==Scope==

While mobilities is commonly associated with [[sociology]], contributions to the mobilities literature have come from scholars in [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[migration studies]], [[science and technology studies]], and [[tourism geography|tourism]] and [[transport]] studies. (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 207)

Mobilities as a specific body of research remains associated with a small group of largely British researchers, notably [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]], [[Mimi Sheller]], Peter Adey, Tim Edensor, David Bissell, and [[Tim Cresswell]]. However, Cresswell (2011, 555) notes that "many people involved in research on mobility topics do not see themselves as part of a new paradigm or turn" (e.g. [[Noel B. Salazar]]). The community of mobilities researchers, as well as the areas they research, have expanded across the globe.

The eponymous journal ''Mobilities'' provides a list of typical subjects which have been explored in the mobilities paradigm (Taylor and Francis, 2011):
* Mobile spatiality and temporality
* [[sustainable mobility|Sustainable]] and alternative mobilities
* Mobile rights and risks
* New [[social networks]] and [[mobile media]]
* Immobilities and [[social exclusion]]s
* [[Tourism]] and [[travel]] mobilities
* [[Human migration|Migration]] and [[diaspora]]s
* [[Transportation]] and [[communication technologies]]
* Transitions in complex systems

==Origins==

Sheller and Urry (2006, 215) place mobilities in the sociological tradition by defining the primordial theorist of mobilities as [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918). Simmel's essays, "Bridge and Door" (Simmel, 1909 / 1994) and "The Metropolis and Mental Life" (Simmel, 1903 / 2001) identify a uniquely human will to connection, as well as the urban demands of tempo and precision that are satisfied with mobility.

The more immediate precursors of contemporary mobilities research emerged in the 1990s (Cresswell 2011, 551). Historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] (1997) advocated for a shift from deep analysis of particular places to the routes connecting them. [[Marc Augé]] (1995) considered the philosophical potential of an anthropology of "non-places" like [[airport]]s and [[motorway]]s that are characterized by constant transition and temporality. Sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] outlined a "network society" and suggested that the "space of places" is being surpassed by a "space of flows." Feminist scholar [[Caren Kaplan]] (1996) explored questions about the gendering of metaphors of travel in social and cultural theory.

The contemporary paradigm under the moniker "mobilities" appears to originate with the work of sociologist [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]]. In his book, ''Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century'', Urry (2000, 1) presents a "manifesto for a sociology that examines the diverse mobilities of peoples, objects, images, information and wastes; and of the complex interdependencies between, and social consequences of, these diverse mobilities."

This is consistent with the aims and scope of the eponymous journal ''Mobilities'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rmob20/current#.VKZE_ZOZE_Y ''Mobilities''] ({{ISSN|1745-0101}} (print), {{ISSN|1745-011X}} (online))&lt;/ref&gt; which "examines both the large-scale movements of people, objects, capital, and information across the world, as well as more local processes of daily transportation, movement through public and private spaces, and the travel of material things in everyday life" (Taylor and Francis, 2011).

In 2006, Mimi Sheller and John Urry published an oft-cited paper that examined the mobilities paradigm as it was just emerging, exploring its motivations, theoretical underpinnings, and methodologies. Sheller and Urry specifically focused on [[automobility]] as a powerful socio-technical system that "impacts not only on local [[public space]]s and opportunities for coming together, but also on the formation of gendered subjectivities, familial and social networks, spatially segregated urban neighborhoods, national images and aspirations to modernity, and global relations ranging from transnational migration to terrorism and [[oil war]]s" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 209).

Mobilities can be viewed as an extension of the "[[spatial turn]]" in the arts and sciences in the 1980s, in which scholars began "to interpret space and the spatiality of human life with the same critical insight and interpretive power as have traditionally been given to time and history (the historicality of human life) on one hand, and to social relations and society (the sociality of human life) on the other" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 216; Engel and Nugent, 2010, 1; Soja, 1999 / 2005, 261).

Engel and Nugent (2010) trace the conceptual roots of the spatial turn to [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Henri Lefebvre]] (1974), although [[Fredric Jameson]] appears to have coined the epochal usage of the term for the 1980s paradigm shift. Jameson (1988 / 2003, 154) notes that the concept of the spatial turn "has often seemed to offer one of the more productive ways of distinguishing postmodernism from modernism proper, whose experience of temporality -- existential time, along with deep memory -- it is henceforth conventional to see as dominant of the high modern."

For Oswin &amp; Yeoh (2010) mobility seems to be inextricably intertwined with late-modernity and the end of the nation-state. The sense of mobility makes us to think in migratory and tourist fluxes as well as the necessary infrastructure for that displacement takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Oswin, N. Y., Yeoh, B. "Introduction: Mobile City Singapore". ''Mobilities'' Vol. 5 (2), 2010, pp. 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt; R. Tzanelli (2014) explains that modernity has recycled the human emotions, particularly trauma, whatever their cause may be, to generate a logic of spectacle.  Any mediated and consumed event not only destroys the previous states of conflicts and cleavages, but provides a one-sided ideological message to visitors. Tourism is for Tzanelli more than a mechanism to control, it is an instrument of [[ideology]]. The efficacy for state to reduce the discrepancy and discontent of citizenry consists in commoditizing the human suffering into affordable products.&lt;ref&gt;Tzanelli, R. (2014). "Embodied art and aesthetic performativity in the London 2012 handover to Rio (2016)". ''Global Studies Journal'', 6(2), 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

P. Vannini (2012) opted to see mobility as a projection of existent cultural values, expectances and structures that denotes styles of life. Mobility after all would not only generate effects on people's behaviour but also specific styles of life. Vannini explains convincingly that on [[Canada]]'s coast, the values of islanders defy the hierarchal order in populated cities from many perspectives. Islanders prioritize the social cohesion and trust of their communities before the alienation of mega-cities. There is a clear physical isolation that marks the boundaries between urbanity and rurality. From another view, nonetheless, this ideological dichotomy between authenticity and alienation leads residents to commercialize their spaces to outsiders. Although the tourism industry is adopted in these communities as a form of activity, many locals have historically migrated from urban populated cities.&lt;ref&gt;Vannini, P. (2012). ''Ferry Tales: Mobility, places and time on Canada's West Coast''. New York, [[Routledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobilities and transportation geography==

The intellectual roots of mobilities in sociology distinguish it from traditional transportation studies and [[transportation geography]], which have firmer roots in mid 20th century [[Positivism|positivist]] spatial science.

Cresswell (2011, 551) presents six characteristics distinguishing mobilities from prior approaches to the study of migration or transport:

* Mobilities often links science and social science to the [[humanities]].
* Mobilities often links across different scales of movement, while traditional transportation geography tends to focus on particular forms of movement at only one scale (such as local traffic studies or household travel surveys).
* Mobilities encompasses the movement of people, objects, and ideas, rather than narrowly focusing on areas like passenger [[modal shift]] or [[freight logistics]].
* Mobilities considers both motion and "stopping, stillness and relative immobility."
* Mobilities incorporates mobile theorization and methodologies to avoid the privileging of "notions of boundedness and the sedentary."
* Mobilities often embraces the political and differential politics of mobility, as opposed to the apolitical, "objective" stance often sought by researchers associated with engineering disciplines

Mobilities can be seen as a postmodern descendant of modernist [[transportation studies]], with the influence of the spatial turn corresponding to a "[[post-structuralist]] agnosticism about both naturalistic and universal explanations and about single-voiced historical narratives, and to the concomitant recognition that position and context are centrally and inescapably implicated in all constructions of knowledge" (Cosgrove, 1999, 7; Warf and Arias, 2009).

Despite these [[ontological]] and [[epistemological]] differences, Shaw and Hesse (2010, 207) have argued that mobilities and transport geography represent points on a continuum rather than incompatible extremes. Indeed, traditional transport geography has not been wholly quantitative any more than mobilities is wholly qualitative. Sociological explorations of mobility can incorporate empirical techniques, while model-based inquiries can be tempered with richer understandings of the meanings, representations and assumptions inherently embedded in models.

Shaw and Sidaway (2010, 505) argue that even as research in the mobilities paradigm has attempted to reengage transportation and the social sciences, mobilities shares a fate similar to traditional transportation geography in still remaining outside the mainstream of the broader academic geographic community.

==Theoretical underpinnings of Mobilities==

Sheller and Urry (2006, 215-217) presented six bodies of theory underpinning the mobilities paradigm:

The prime theoretical foundation of mobilities is the work of early 20th-century sociologist [[Georg Simmel]], who identified a uniquely human "will to connection," and provided a theoretical connection between mobility and materiality. Simmel focused on the increased tempo of [[urban sociology|urban life]], that "drives not only its social, economic, and [[urban infrastructure|infrastructural]] formations, but also the psychic forms of the urban dweller." Along with this tempo comes a need for precision in timing and location in order to prevent chaos, which results in [[complexity|complex]] and novel systems of relationships.

A second body of theory comes from the science and technology studies which look at mobile sociotechnical systems that incorporate hybrid geographies of human and nonhuman components. [[Automobile]], [[rail transport|rail]] or [[air transport]] systems involve complex [[transport network]]s that affect society and are affected by society. These networks can have dynamic and enduring parts. Non-transport information networks can also have unpredictable effects on encouraging or suppressing physical mobility (Pellegrino 2012).

A third body of theory comes from the [[postmodern]] conception of [[spatiality]], with the substance of places being constantly in [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and subject to constant reassembly and reconfiguration (Thrift 1996).

A fourth body of theory is a "recentring of the corporeal body as an affective vehicle through which we sense place and movement, and construct emotional geographies". For example, the car is "experienced through a combination of senses and sensed through multiple registers of motion and emotion″ (Sheller and Urry 2006, 216).

A fifth body of theory incorporates how [[topologies]] of social networks relate to how complex [[pattern formation|patterns form and change]]. Contemporary information technologies and ways of life often create broad but weak social ties across time and space, with [[interpersonal relationships|social life]] incorporating fewer chance meetings and more networked connections.

Finally, the last body of theory is the analysis of complex transportation systems that are "neither perfectly ordered nor anarchic." For example, the rigid spatial coupling, operational timings, and historical bindings of rail contrast with unpredictable environmental conditions and ever-shifting political winds. And, yet, "change through the accumulation of small repetitions...could conceivably tip the [[car dependence|car system]] into the [[car-free movement|postcar system]]."

==Mobilities methodologies==

Mimi Sheller and John Urry (2006, 217-219) presented seven methodological areas often covered in mobilities research:

* Analysis of the patterning, timing and causation of face-to-face co-presence
* Mobile [[ethnography]] - participation in patterns of movement while conducting ethnographic research
* Time-space diaries - subjects record what they are doing, at what times and in what places
* Cyber-research - exploration of virtual mobilities through various forms of electronic connectivity
* Study of experiences and feelings
* Study of memory and private worlds via photographs, letters, images and souvenirs
* Study of in-between places and transfer points like lounges, waiting rooms, cafes, amusement arcades, parks, hotels, airports, stations, motels, harbors

'''The Myth of Redemptive Violence''' is an archetypal [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] in [[literature]], especially in [[empire|imperial]] cultures.  One of the oldest versions of this story is the [[creation myth]] of [[Babylon]] (the [[Enûma Elish]]) from around 1250 B.C.  [[Walter Wink]] coined the term as part of an analysis of its impact on modern culture and its role in maintaining oppressive power structures in his book ''The Powers That Be''.

==Narrative and effect==
While contrasting the Enûma Elish with the [[Genesis creation myth]] found in the [[Book of Genesis]], Wink examines the psychological effects of each phase of the story.  He asserts that every phase of the narrative serves to reinforce the ideology of the status quo and convince us to perpetuate the ruling power structure:

===Primal chaos===
The primacy of [[Tiamat]] suggests that chaos and evil are the original and natural state of the universe.  This can be used to convince us to fear and oppose any threat to the current order, under the assumption that things can only get worse.  Superheroes especially have dark origins (for example, the murder of [[Bruce Wayne]]'s parents and the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|planet Krypton]]), and the pervasiveness of evil is depicted by the resurrection of villains in [[horror movies]] and [[cartoons]], the exaggerated presence of violent crime in [[news]] coverage, and the overwhelming number and variety of bad creatures in [[The Lord of the Rings]].

===Tammuz===
Tiamat and her allies oppress the other gods, who, at first, seem powerless to resist.  This acknowledges the effectiveness of alternative systems, and gives us the guilty pleasure of vicariously harming our "betters" and breaking their rules.  However, all this is constrained by the exaggerated flaws of the antagonists, which foreshadow their failure and make us ashamed to identify with them.  [[Horror films]] tend to emphasize this part of the narrative to the extreme, whereas [[superhero]] stories often marginalize it.

===Heroism===
[[Marduk]] offers to defeat Tiamat in exchange for absolute rule over the remaining gods, and they all agree.  This elevates "[[might makes right]]" to a contract made at the beginning of the universe.  People are inclined to identify with the hero because of his privileges and his good attributes, and to sympathize with any subsequent oppression.  Modern examples include [[James Bond]]'s license to kill, the gold mine given to [[Doc Savage]]'s father, Friday's loyalty to [[Robinson Crusoe]], the brazen dishonesty of [[Jedi]] knights, the extremes of [[Jack Bauer]], etc.

===Triumph===
Marduk slays his enemies in creative, gory, and intricate ways, then goes on to enslave their underlings.  This shows that good prevails and evil suffers; the corollary to this is that those who prevail are good.  This gives us the catharsis of vengeance and indignation.  Once again we can sadistically enjoy a character's suffering, but this time in a sanctioned, acceptable context.  The spectacular downfall and glorious victory prompt us to reject the antagonist and  reaffirm our commitment to the winning party, respectively.  [[Action movies]] and [[video games]] tend to have a decisive final battle.  An opposition leader's death scene often includes ridiculously thorough destruction of his or her body, property, and/or organization, such as [[Julius No|Dr. No]] drowning in the core of his nuclear reactor, which then melts down.

===Redemption===
Marduk makes the world from Tiamat's corpse and humanity from the blood of [[Kingu]].  This leaves us with the message that our prosperity and even our very existence required past violence and destruction; as Wink puts it, "We are the outcome of deicide."  This helps justify recent and ongoing violence by appealing to our self-interest.  The death or defeat of the antagonist tends to be immediately followed by an idyllic happy ending in simple, violent plots of all stripes.  Current examples include the [[Ewok]] percussion instrument made from [[Imperial stormtrooper|Storm Trooper]] and other Imperial helmets (or heads) at the end of [[Return of the Jedi]], and the brain surgery Doc Savage uses to turn criminals into productive citizens.

==Opposing views==
Traditionally, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have noted that myths transmit elements of culture and shape the listener's worldview without making value judgments as to the merit of a given culture or the validity of its worldview.  Wink's analysis is predicated on the notion that Babylonian society and pagan religion, as well as Western society and popular culture, are intrinsically less valid than his notion of first century [[Christian]] society and "pure" [[monotheism]].

It has also been postulated that the creation story of Genesis was developed in reaction to earlier stories, including the Enûma Elish, since the stories share common elements that other creation beliefs lack.  Adherents of [[meme]] theory see the similarity as more fundamental: each story advocates a certain power structure, which has led people in power to support the story that favors them, often oppressively and often using violence.  Whether or not a myth directly advocates violence and oppression, it may still foster misery and destruction.

== The Two Brothers ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=needs proper citations &amp; formatting|date=October 2014}}

The [[Tale of Two Brothers]] is an ancient Egyptian story from around the 13th century BCE. The narrative is preserved on the [[Papyrus D'Orbiney]]. [Tale of Two Brothers] which had belonged to Seti II (1209-1205 B.C.) of the nineteenth Egyptian dynasty when he was crown prince [William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Egyptian Tales: Translated from the Papyri, 1895, p.&amp;nbsp;66 ] and may have been a political satire based in part on his own difficulties with his half brother, the usurper Amenmesse[J. H. Breasted Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Three, §§ 239ff. ], but the historical facts concerning this period are so uncertain as to render such a conclusion speculative. The text has similarities to the story of Joseph in the house of Potiphar, in Genesis 39:1-20, however the relation between the two texts is unclear, if, indeed, there is one.[Shaw, Ian. &amp; Nicholson, Paul. The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p.&amp;nbsp;54. The British Museum Press, 1995] Further elements of the story seem to be derived from the myths concerning Osiris' death and resurrection.[Erman, Adolph. Life in Ancient Egypt. p.&amp;nbsp;379. Dover Publications, 1971. ] The protagonists Anpu and Bata both bear names of gods of the 17th nome of Upper Egypt.

===Synopsis===
Bata lives with his married brother Anpu. One day, when Anpu is not at home, his wife tries to seduce Bata, and, having been repelled, accuses Bata of having made advances towards her. Anpu grows angry and wants to kill his younger brother who flees. Pre-Harakhte saves him by creating a body of water full of crocodiles between him and his brother. Bata tells his brother what has occurred and, as proof of his sincerity, cuts off his genitals which are swallowed by a fish. Anpu returns home and kills his wife. Bata lives alone in the wilderness until the gods create a wife for him. Bata loves her very much and reveals to her that his heart is hidden in a pine. Pharaoh, on learning of her existence has her brought to his court. She tells him Bata's secret and he has the pine cut down, killing Bata. Anpu goes to look for his brother, and after finding his body he searches for his heart and finds it after years of searching. Bata is revived and wants to take revenge on his wife. He changes himself into a beautiful bull and his brother takes him to Pharaoh. Bata reveals himself to his wife who has him killed. Two drops of his blood are spilled and from them grow two persea trees, incarnations of Bata. His wife has them felled, but a splinter of their wood enters her mouth, she swallows it and becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, a reincarnation of Bata, who is acknowledged as the Pharaoh's heir. When Pharaoh dies and he becomes king, he has the queen tried and killed.
 
•	P. D'Orbiney (P. Brit. Mus. 10183), written towards the end of the 19th dynasty by the scribe Ennana.[Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol.2, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;203 ] It was acquired by the British Museum in 1857.

'''Network literacy''' is an emerging [[digital literacy]] that deals with [[computer network]] knowledge and skills. It is linked to [[computer literacy]] and [[information literacy]].

Network literacy relates to the basic knowledge and skills required for citizens to participate in the [[network society|networked society]]. Networking is become ubiquitous in the 21st Century and an understanding of network systems (such as the [[Internet]]) and network devices (such as [[smartphones]]) is vital for full participation in many modern societies.

The knowledge and skills normally associated with network literacy include:&lt;ref&gt;Digital Literacy Competency Framework, Scottish Qualifications Authority, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* uses of networks
* growth of networks
* value of networks (including [[Metcalf's Law]])
* operating principles of digital communication networks
* network safety
* network security
* online rights and responsibilities
* network performance
* implications for individuals, groups, communities and nations.

Network literacy may also embrace knowledge of [[social networks]] and [[personal learning network]]s. Behavioural protocols ("netiquette") are normally included.

The [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) will significantly extend the scope and reach of computer networks, and put greater focus on network literacy.

An important aspect of network literacy is the personal, economic, political, cultural and societal impact of the growth of networks on modern societies. Revelations by [[Edward Snowden]] illustrated the potential conflict between state security and personal freedom created by the growth of networking.

'''Partners for Democratic Change International (PDCI)''' is a global partnership of [[Partners for Democratic Change|Partners for Democratic Change (Partners)]] and the nineteen independent, local organizations Partners founded in Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa that work to advance [[civil society]], [[good governance]] and a culture of change and [[conflict management]] worldwide.

==Organisation==

===PDCI's history===
Partners for Democratic Change was established in 1989. Responding initially to the monumental changes in Central and Eastern Europe, Partners established Centers across Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa in this way generating and supporting sustainable capacity and local competences to address governmental, business, and civil society disputes, conflicts, and change issues through mediating processes and programs.

Now independent NGOs with unique specializations, the organizations share common core competencies, enabling them to train citizens, government officials, non-government activists, and business leaders through in-country and regional training initiatives, and to apply their mediating and collaborative expertise and methodologies to public disputes and issues.

As early as 1998, a next-generation network of the strong and well-established organizations founded by Partners for Democratic Change came into view. PDCI’s early incarnations included coordination mechanisms and intra-network exchanges. In 2001, the members signed the PDCI Charter, began a tradition of meeting thrice a year and extorting contributions for a “PDCI Fund”.

===The network secretariat in Brussels===
In 2006 the members founded PDCI, a non-profit association under Belgian law, with a commitment to sharing their knowledge, expertise, and skills to strengthen one another, advancing their national, regional and international work, and forming an alliance that will enable others to be enriched by their peace, justice and civil society work locally.

A secretariat was established in Brussels in mid-2007.

'''[http://www.partnersglobal.org Partners for Democratic Change]''': was established in 1989. After leaving [[Community Boards]] [[Raymond Shonholtz]] established Partners for Democratic Change dedicated to building sustainable local capacity to advance civil society and a culture of change and conflict management worldwide. In the promising atmosphere following the downfall of [[Communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe, American and other foreign consultants flooded in with short-term training programs and policy recommendations. Partners took a different development path. Appreciating that democratic change and civil society building required new and acculturated skills and methods, Partners established from 1991 to 1994 six national Centers led by trained, local professionals, whose expertise over time would exceed the need of expatriate consultants. Today, Partners is the largest and only global change and conflict management institutional building organization. What began as an experiment within academic institutions is now an expanding, innovative international organization with 18 Centers, a hub in Brussels and one in Washington, DC, as well as Center and Partners programs in another 20 countries. Centers are among the preeminent institutions in their home countries, supporting civil society, inter-ethnic relations, network building, anti-corruption reform, [[family mediation]], youth and women’s leadership, local government reform, and a host of other initiatives. Partners, the Centers, and PDCI are in a close partnership, pursuing a common mission while maintaining individuality and local independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partnersglobal.org/who/history |title=History — Partners for Democratic Change |publisher=Partnersglobal.org |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">A '''power structure''' is an overall system of influence relationships between any individual and every other individual within any selected group of people. A description of a power structure would capture the way in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]] is distributed between people within groups such as a government, nation, institution, organization, or a society.&lt;ref&gt;G. William Domhoff, Thomas R. Dye, ''Power Elites and Organizations'' (1987), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Such structures are of interest to various fields, including [[sociology]], [[government]], [[economics]], and [[business]]. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like [[Social justice|fairness]] or [[efficiency]], as in a [[hierarchical organization]] wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a [[dominance hierarchy]] in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a [[dominator culture]], the opposite of an egalitarian culture of partnership. A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure is often referred to as being [[the Establishment]]. Power structures are fluid, with changes occurring constantly, either slowly or rapidly, evolving or revolutionary, peacefully or violently.

The '''public sphere''' (German {{lang|de|Öffentlichkeit}}) is an area in [[social relation|social life]] where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action. Such a discussion is called public debate and is defined as the expression of views on matters that are of concern to the public—often, but not always, with opposing or diverging views being expressed by participants in the discussion. Public debate takes place mostly through the mass media, but also at meetings or through social media, academic publications and government policy documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320656629|title=Public Brainpower: Civil Society and Natural Resource Management|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2018-01-01|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally coined by German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] who defined "the public sphere as a virtual or imaginary community which does not necessarily exist in any identifiable space".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-studies.ca/articles/habermas.htm|title=Jürgen Habermas and the Public Sphere|last=Soules|first=Marshall|date=|website=Media Studies.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Communication]] scholar [[Gerard A.

This notion of the public becomes evident in terms such as public health, public education, public opinion or public ownership.

Most contemporary conceptualizations of the public sphere are based on the ideas expressed in [[Jürgen Habermas]]' book ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere|The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere – An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society]]'', which is a translation of his ''[[Habilitation]]sschrift,'' ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit:Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas stipulates that, due to specific historical circumstances, a new civic society emerged in the eighteenth century. Driven by a need for open commercial arenas where news and matters of common concern could be freely exchanged and discussed—accompanied by growing rates of literacy, accessibility to literature, and a new kind of critical journalism—a separate domain from ruling authorities started to evolve across Europe. "In its clash with the arcane and bureaucratic practices of the absolutist state, the emergent bourgeoisie gradually replaced a public sphere in which the ruler's power was merely represented before the people with a sphere in which state authority was publicly monitored through informed and critical discourse by the people".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas 1989:xi&lt;/ref&gt;

In his historical analysis, Habermas points out three so-called "institutional criteria" as preconditions for the emergence of the new public sphere. The discursive arenas, such as Britain's coffee houses, France's salons, and Germany's ''Tischgesellschaften'' "may have differed in the size and compositions of their publics, the style of their proceedings, the climate of their debates, and their topical orientations", but "they all organized discussion among people that tended to be ongoing; hence they had a number of institutional criteria in common":&lt;ref&gt;Habermas 1989, pp.36&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Disregard of status:'' Preservation of "a kind of social intercourse that, far from presupposing the equality of status, disregarded status altogether. ... Not that this idea of the public was actually realized in earnest in the coffee houses, salons, and the societies; but as an idea, it had become institutionalized and thereby stated as an objective claim. If not realized, it was at least consequential." (''loc.  cit.'')
# ''Domain of common concern:'' "... discussion within such a public presupposed the problematization of areas that until then had not been questioned. The domain of 'common concern' which was the object of public critical attention remained a preserve in which church and state authorities had the monopoly of interpretation. ... The private people for whom the cultural product became available as a commodity profaned it inasmuch as they had to determine its meaning on their own (by way of rational communication with one another), verbalize it, and thus state explicitly what precisely in its implicitness for so long could assert its authority." (''loc. cit.'')
# ''Inclusivity:'' However exclusive the public might be in any given instance, it could never close itself off entirely and become consolidated as a clique; for it always understood and found itself immersed within a more inclusive public of all private people, persons who – insofar as they were propertied and educated – as readers, listeners, and spectators could avail themselves via the market of the objects that were subject to discussion. The issues discussed became 'general' not merely in their significance, but also in their accessibility: everyone had to be able to participate. ... Wherever the public established itself institutionally as a stable group of discussants, it did not equate itself with the public but at most claimed to act as its mouthpiece, in its name, perhaps even as its educator – the new form of bourgeois representation" (''loc. cit.'').

Habermas argued that the bourgeois society cultivated and upheld these criteria. The public sphere was well established in various locations including coffee shops and salons, areas of society where various people could gather and discuss matters that concerned them. The coffee houses in London society at this time became the centers of art and literary criticism, which gradually widened to include even the economic and the political disputes as matters of discussion. In French salons, as Habermas says, "opinion became emancipated from the bonds of economic dependence".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any new work, or a book or a musical composition had to get its legitimacy in these places. It not only paved a forum for self-expression but in fact had become a platform for airing one’s opinions and agendas for public discussion.
[[File:Parlement-Paris-Charles7.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parlement|Parliamentary]] action under [[Charles VII of France]]]]

The emergence of a bourgeois public sphere was particularly supported by the 18th-century liberal democracy making resources available to this new political class to establish a network of institutions like publishing enterprises, newspapers and discussion forums, and the democratic press was the main tool to execute this. The key feature of this public sphere was its separation from the power of both the church and the government due to its access to a variety of resources, both economic and social.

As Habermas argues, in due course, this sphere of rational and [[cosmopolitanism|universalistic politics]], free from both the economy and the State, was destroyed by the same forces that initially established it. This collapse was due to the consumeristic drive that infiltrated society, so citizens became more concerned about consumption than political actions. Furthermore, the growth of capitalistic economy led to an uneven distribution of wealth, thus widening economic polarity. Suddenly the media became a tool of political forces and a medium for advertising rather than the medium from which the public got their information on political matters. This resulted in limiting access to the public sphere and the political control of the public sphere was inevitable for the modern capitalistic forces to operate and thrive in the competitive economy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therewith emerged a new sort of influence, i.e., media power, which, used for purposes of manipulation, once and for all took care of the innocence of the principle of publicity. The public sphere, simultaneously restructured and dominated by the mass media, developed into an arena infiltrated by power in which, by means of topic selection and topical contributions, a battle is fought not only over influence but over the control of communication flows that affect behavior while their strategic intentions are kept hidden as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Counterpublics, feminist critiques and expansions==
Although ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere|Structural Transformation]]'' was (and is) one of the most influential works in contemporary German philosophy and political science, it took 27 years until an English version appeared on the market in 1989. Based on a conference on the occasion of the English translation, at which Habermas himself attended, [[Craig Calhoun]] (1992) edited ''Habermas and the Public Sphere''&lt;ref&gt;Berdal 2004, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | editor-last =Calhoun  | editor-link =Craig Calhoun  | title =Habermas and the Public Sphere  | place=Cambridge Mass.  | publisher =The MIT press  | year =1993  | location =  | pages=  | page=  | volume =  | edition =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-0-262-53114-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – a thorough dissection of Habermas' bourgeois public sphere by scholars from various academic disciplines. The core criticism at the conference was directed towards the above stated "institutional criteria":

# '''Hegemonic dominance and exclusion:''' In ''Rethinking the Public Sphere'', [[Nancy Fraser]] offers a feminist revision of Habermas' historical description of the public sphere, and confronts it with "recent revisionist historiography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; She refers to other scholars, like Joan Landes, [[Mary P. Ryan]] and [[Geoff Eley]], when she argues that the bourgeois public sphere was in fact constituted by a "number of significant exclusions." In contrast to Habermas’ assertions on disregard of status and inclusivity, Fraser claims that the bourgeois public sphere discriminated against women and other historically marginalized groups: "... this network of clubs and associations – philanthropic, civic, professional, and cultural – was anything but accessible to everyone. On the contrary, it was the arena, the training ground and eventually the power base of a stratum of bourgeois men who were coming to see themselves as a “universal class” and preparing to assert their fitness to govern." Thus, she stipulates a hegemonic tendency of the male bourgeois public sphere, which dominated at the cost of alternative publics (for example by gender, social status, ethnicity and property ownership), thereby averting other groups from articulating their particular concerns.
# '''Bracketing of inequalities:''' Fraser makes us recall that "the bourgeois conception of the public sphere requires bracketing inequalities of status". The "public sphere was to be an arena in which interlocutors would set aside such characteristics as a difference in birth and fortune and speak to one another ''as if'' they were social and economic peers". Fraser refers to feminist research by [[Jane Mansbridge]], which notes several relevant "ways in which deliberation can serve as a mask for domination". Consequently, she argues that "such bracketing usually works to the advantage of dominant groups in society and to the disadvantage of subordinates." Thus, she concludes: "In most cases, it would be more appropriate to unbracket inequalities in the sense of explicitly thematizing them – a point that accords with the spirit of Habermas' later communicative ethics".
# '''The problematic definition of "common concern":''' Nancy Fraser points out that "there are no naturally given, [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] boundaries" between matters that are generally conceived as private, and ones we typically label as public (i.e. of "common concern"). As an example, she refers to the historic shift in the general conception of domestic violence, from previously being a matter of primarily private concern, to now generally being accepted as a common one: "Eventually, after sustained discursive contestation we succeeded in making it a common concern".

[[File:Edenton-North-Carolina-women-Tea-boycott-1775.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''A Society of Patriotic Ladies at Edenton in North Carolina'', [[satirical]] drawing of a women's counterpublic in action in the [[Edenton Tea Party|1775 tea boycott]]]]

[[Nancy Fraser]] identified the fact that marginalized groups are excluded from a universal public sphere, and thus it was impossible to claim that one group would, in fact, be inclusive. However, she claimed that marginalized groups formed their own public spheres, and termed this concept a ''subaltern counter public'' or counter-public.

Fraser worked from Habermas' basic theory because she saw it to be "an indispensable resource" but questioned the actual structure and attempted to address her concerns.&lt;ref name="Fraser 1990, p. 57"/&gt; She made the observation that "Habermas stops short of developing a new, post-bourgeois model of the public sphere".&lt;ref name="Fraser 1990, p 58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|1990|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser attempted to evaluate Habermas' bourgeois public sphere, discuss some assumptions within his model, and offer a modern conception of the public sphere.&lt;ref name="Fraser 1990, p 58"/&gt;

In the historical reevaluation of the bourgeois public sphere, Fraser argues that rather than opening up the political realm to everyone, the bourgeois public sphere shifted political power from "a repressive mode of domination to a [[hegemonic]] one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|1990|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than rule by power, there was now rule by the majority ideology. To deal with this hegemonic domination, Fraser argues that repressed groups form "Subaltern counter-publics" that are "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|1990|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benhabib notes that in Habermas' idea of the public sphere, the distinction between public and private issues separates issues that normally affect women (issues of "reproduction, nurture and care for the young, the sick, and the elderly")&lt;ref&gt;Benhabib 1992 pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; into the private realm and out of the discussion in the public sphere. She argues that if the public sphere is to be open to any discussion that affects the population, there cannot be distinctions between "what is" and "what is not" discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Benhabib 1992, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Benhabib argues for feminists to counter the popular public discourse in their own counter public.

The public sphere was long regarded as men's domain whereas women were supposed to inhabit the private domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Vickery |first1= Amanda | authorlink1 = Amanda Vickery |year= 1993 |title= Golden age to separate spheres?

The concept of [[heteronormativity]] is used to describe the way in which those who fall outside of the basic male/female dichotomy of [[gender]] or whose sexual orientations are other than [[heterosexual]] cannot meaningfully claim their identities, causing a disconnect between their public selves and their private selves. [[Michael Warner]] made the observation that the idea of an inclusive public sphere makes the assumption that we are all the same without judgments about our fellows. He argues that we must achieve some sort of disembodied state in order to participate in a universal public sphere without being judged. His observations point to a homosexual counter public, and offers the idea that homosexuals must otherwise remain "closeted" in order to participate in the larger public discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Gerard A. Hauser|Gerard Hauser]] proposed a different direction for the public sphere than previous models. He foregrounds the [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] nature of public spheres, suggesting that public spheres form around "the ongoing dialogue on public issues" rather than the identity of the group engaged in the discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Rather than arguing for an all-inclusive public sphere, or the analysis of tension between public spheres, he suggested that publics were formed by active members of society around issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|1998|p=86,92}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a group of interested individuals who engage in vernacular discourse about a specific issue.&lt;ref name="Hauser 1998, p. 92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|1998|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Publics may be repressed, distorted, or responsible, but any evaluation of their actual state requires that we inspect the rhetorical environment as well as the rhetorical act out of which they evolved, for these are the conditions that constitute their individual character".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|1999|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people formed rhetorical public spheres that were based in discourse, not necessarily orderly discourse but any interactions whereby the interested public engages each other.&lt;ref name="Hauser 1998, p. 92"/&gt; This interaction can take the form of institutional actors as well as the basic "street rhetoric" that "open[s] a dialogue between competing factions."&lt;ref name="Hauser 1998, p. 90"/&gt; The spheres themselves formed around the issues that were being deliberated. The discussion itself would reproduce itself across the spectrum of interested publics "even though we lack personal acquaintance with all but a few of its participants and are seldom in contexts where we and they directly interact, we join these exchanges because they are discussing the same matters".&lt;ref name="Hauser 1999, p. 64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to communicate within the public sphere, "those who enter any given arena must share a reference world for their discourse to produce awareness for shared interests and public opinions about them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This world consists of common meanings and cultural norms from which interaction can take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sblondon-elecgraffiti05.jpg|thumb|left|Political [[Graffiti]] on the South Bank of the Thames in London 2005, "even though we lack personal acquaintance with all but a few of its participants and are seldom in contexts where we and they directly interact, we join these exchanges because they are discussing the same matters".&lt;ref name="Hauser 1999, p. 64"/&gt;]]

The rhetorical public sphere has several primary features:
# it is discourse-based, rather than class-based.
# the critical norms are derived from actual discursive practices. Taking a universal reasonableness out of the picture, arguments are judged by how well they resonate with the population that is discussing the issue.
# intermediate bracketing of discursive exchanges. Rather than a conversation that goes on across a population as a whole, the public sphere is composed of many intermediate dialogs that merge later on in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|1999|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetorical public sphere was characterized by five rhetorical norms from which it can be gauged and criticized. How well the public sphere adheres to these norms determine the effectiveness of the public sphere under the rhetorical model. Those norms are:

# ''permeable boundaries'': Although a public sphere may have a specific membership as with any social movement or deliberative assembly, people outside the group can participate in the discussion.
# ''activity'': Publics are active rather than passive. They do not just hear the issue and applaud, but rather they actively engage the issue and the publics surrounding the issue.
# ''contextualized language'': They require that participants adhere to the rhetorical norm of contextualized language to render their respective experiences intelligible to one another.
# ''believable appearance'': The public sphere must appear to be believable to each other and the outside public.
# ''tolerance'': In order to maintain a vibrant discourse, others opinions need to be allowed to enter the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|1999|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In all this Hauser believes a public sphere is a "discursive space in which strangers discuss issues they perceive to be of consequence for them and their group. Its rhetorical exchanges are the bases for shared awareness of common issues, shared interests, tendencies of extent and strength of difference and agreement, and self-constitution as a public whose opinions bear on the organization of society."&lt;ref name="Hauser 1999, p. 64"/&gt;

This concept that the public sphere acts as a medium in which public opinion is formed as analogous to a lava lamp. Just as the lamp's structure changes, with its lava separating and forming new shapes, so does the public sphere's creation of opportunities for discourse to address public opinion, thereby forming new discussions of rhetoric. The lava of the public which holds together the public arguments is the public conversation.

==Media==
Habermas argues that the public sphere requires "specific means for transmitting information and influencing those who receive it".&lt;ref name="Habermas 1989 136"/&gt;

Habermas' argument shows that the media are of particular importance for constituting and maintaining a public sphere.  Discussions about the media have therefore been of particular importance in public sphere theory.

===As actors in the political public sphere===

According to [[Jürgen Habermas]], there are two types of actors without whom no political public sphere could be put to work: professionals in the media system and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;.{{Citation

For Habermas, there are five types of actors who make their appearance on the virtual stage of an established public sphere:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) Lobbyists who represent special interest groups;

(b) Advocates who either represent general interest groups or substitute for a lack of representation of marginalized groups that are unable to voice their interests effectively;

(c) Experts who are credited with professional or scientific knowledge in some specialized area and are invited to give advice;

(d) Moral entrepreneurs who generate public attention for supposedly neglected issues;

(e) Intellectuals who have gained, unlike advocates or moral entrepreneurs, a perceived personal reputation in some field (e.g., as writers or academics) and who engage, unlike experts and lobbyists, spontaneously in public discourse with the declared intention of promoting general interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===YouTube as a public sphere===

Habermas argues that under certain conditions, the media act to facilitate discourse in a public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|date=2006-11-01|title=Political Communication in Media Society: Does Democracy Still Enjoy an Epistemic Dimension? The Impact of Normative Theory on Empirical Research1|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=411–426|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00280.x|issn=1468-2885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the Internet has brought about a resurgence of scholars applying theories of the public sphere to Internet technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Davy|last2=Kies|first2=Raphaël|date=2005-09-01|title=Online Forums and Deliberative Democracy|journal=Acta Politica|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=317–335|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500115|issn=0001-6810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a study by S. Edgerly et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edgerly|first1=Stephanie|last2=Vraga|first2=Emily|last3=Fung|first3=Timothy|last4=Moon|first4=Tae Joon|last5=Yoo|first5=Woo Hyun|title=YouTube as a public sphere: The Proposition 8 debate|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;cluster=15327098741958182872&amp;btnI=1&amp;hl=en|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
focused on the ability of YouTube to serve as an online public sphere. The researchers examined a large sample of video comments using the [[California Proposition 8 (2008)]] as an example.
The authors argue that some scholars think the online public sphere is a space where a wide range of voices can be expressed due to the "low barrier of entry"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edgerly|first1=Stephanie|last2=Vraga|first2=Emily|last3=Fung|first3=Timothy|last4=Moon|first4=Tae Joon|last5=Yoo|first5=Woo Hyun|title=YouTube as a public sphere: The Proposition 8 debate|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;cluster=15327098741958182872&amp;btnI=1&amp;hl=en|page=5|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interactivity. However, they also point at a number of limitations. Edgerly et al. say that the affirmative discourse presupposes that YouTube can be an influential player in the political process and that it can serve as an influential force to politically mobilize young people. The authors mention critiques that say YouTube is built around the popularity of videos with sensationalist content. The research by Edgerly, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edgerly|first1=Stephanie|last2=Vraga|first2=Emily|last3=Fung|first3=Timothy|last4=Moon|first4=Tae Joon|last5=Yoo|first5=Woo Hyun|title=YouTube as a public sphere: The Proposition 8 debate|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;cluster=15327098741958182872&amp;btnI=1&amp;hl=en|page=15|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the analyzed YouTube comments were diverse. They argue that this is a possible indicator that YouTube provides space for public discussion. They also found that YouTube videos' style influences the nature of the commentary. Finally, they concluded that the video's ideological stances influenced the language of the comments. The findings of the work suggest that YouTube is a public sphere platform.

===Limitations of media and the internet===

Some, like Colin Sparks, note that a new global public sphere ought to be created in the wake of increasing globalization and global institutions, which operate at the supranational level.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks (2001), p 75&lt;/ref&gt; However, the key questions for him were, whether any media exists in terms of size and access to fulfil this role. The traditional media, he notes, are close to the public sphere in this true sense. Nevertheless, limitations are imposed by the market and concentration of ownership. At present, the global media fail to constitute the basis of a public sphere for at least three reasons. Similarly, he notes that the internet, for all its potential, does not meet the criteria for a public sphere and that unless these are "overcome, there will be no sign of a global public sphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Sparks

German scholars Jürgen Gerhards and Mike S. Schäfer conducted a study in 2009 in order to establish whether the [[Internet]] offers a better and broader communication environment compared to quality newspapers. They analyzed how the issue of human genome research was portrayed between 1999 and 2001 in popular quality newspapers in both Germany and the United States in comparison to the way it appeared on search engines at the time of their research. Their intention was to analyze what actors and what sort of opinions the subject generated in both print and the Internet and verify whether the online space proved to be a more democratic public sphere, with a wider range of sources and views.
Gerhards and Schäfer say they have found "only minimal evidence to support the idea that the internet is a better communication space as compared to print media".&lt;ref name="Gerhards 2010 13"&gt;{{Citation

"Their gatekeeping, in contrast to the old mass media, relies mainly on technical characteristics of websites".&lt;ref name="Gerhards 2010 13"/&gt;   For Gerhards and Schäfer the Internet is not an alternative public sphere because less prominent voices end up being silenced by the search engines' algorithms. "Search engines might actually silence societal debate by giving more space to established actors and institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There has been an academic debate about how social media impacts the public sphere. The sociologists [[Brian Loader]] and [[Dan Mercea]] give an overview of this discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that social media offers increasing opportunities for political communication and enable democratic capacities for political discussion within the virtual public sphere. The effect would be that citizens could challenge governments and corporations' political and economic power. Additionally, new forms of political participation and information sources for the users emerge with the Internet that can be used, for example, in online campaigns.
However, the two authors point out that social media's dominant uses are entertainment, consumerism, and content sharing among friends. Loader and Mercea point out that "individual preferences reveal an unequal spread of social ties with a few giant nodes such as [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]] attracting the majority of users".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Loader | first = Brian D. | authorlink = Brian D.

Moreover, lines between professional media coverage and user-generated content would blur on social media.

The authors conclude that social media provides new opportunities for political participation; however, they warn users of the risks of accessing unreliable sources. The Internet impacts the virtual public sphere in many ways, but is not a free utopian platform as some observers argued at the beginning of its history.

===Mediated publicness===

[[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]] criticises the traditional idea of public sphere by Habermas, as it is centred mainly in face-to-face interactions. On the contrary, Thompson argues that modern society is characterized by a new form of "mediated publicness",&lt;ref&gt;.{{Citation  | last =Thompson  | first =John B.  | authorlink =John Thompson (sociologist)  | title =The Media and the Modernity: A social theory of the media  | publisher =Polity Press  | year =1995  | location =Cambridge   | pages =125–134  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =978-0-7456-1004-7  | others =}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose main characteristics are:

* Despatialized (there is a rupture of time/space. People can see more things, as they do not need to share the same physical location, but this extended vision always has an angle, which people do not have control over).
* Non dialogical (unidirectional. For example, presenters on TV are not able to adapt their discourse to the reactions of the audience, since they are visible to a wide audience but that audience is not directly visible to them. However, internet allows a bigger interactivity).
* Wider and more diverse audiences. (The same message can reach people with different education, different social class, different values and beliefs, and so on.)

This mediated publicness has altered the power relations in a way in which not only the many are visible to the few but the few can also now see the many:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Whereas the Panopticon renders many people visible to a few and enables power to be exercised over the many by subjecting them to a state of permanent visibility, the development of communication media provides a means by which many people can gather information about a few and, at the same time, a few can appear before many; thanks to the media, it is primarily those who exercise power, rather than those over whom power is exercised, who are subjected to a certain kind of visibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | others =}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Thompson also acknowledges that "media and visibility is a double-edged sword"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Thompson  | first =John B.  | authorlink =John Thompson (sociologist) | title =The Media and the Modernity: A social theory of the media  | publisher =Polity Press  | year =1995  | location =Cambridge  | pages =140  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =978-0-7456-1004-7  | others =}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that even though they can be used to show an improved image (by managing the visibility), individuals are not in full control of their self-presentation. Mistakes, gaffes or scandals are now recorded therefore they are harder to deny, as they can be replayed by the media.

===The public service model===

Examples of the [[public service model]] include [[BBC]] in Britain, and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and SBS in Australia. The political function and effect of modes of public communication has traditionally continued with the dichotomy between Hegelian State and civil society. The dominant theory of this mode includes the liberal theory of the free press. However, the public service, state-regulated model, whether publicly or privately funded, has always been seen not as a positive good but as an unfortunate necessity imposed by the technical limitations of frequency scarcity.

According to Habermas's concept of the public sphere,&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite book| last =Garnham  | first =Nicholas.  | authorlink =Nicholas Garnham  | title =The Media and the public sphere  | publisher =The MIT Press
 | year =1993  | location =London  | pages =360–361  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =978-0-7456-1004-7  | others =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the strength of this concept is that it identifies and stresses the importance for democratic politics of a sphere distinct from the economy and the State. On the other hand, this concept challenges the liberal free press tradition form the grounds of its materiality, and it challenges the Marxist critique of that tradition from the grounds of the specificity of politics as well.

From Garnham's critique,&lt;ref&gt;.{{Citation  | last =Garnham  | first =Nicholas.  | authorlink =Nicholas Garnham  | title =Policy and politics: Public service broadcasting and the information market The Media and the Public Sphere  | publisher =SAGE  | year =1994  | location =London  | pages =108–109  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =978-0-7456-1004-7  | others =}}&lt;/ref&gt; three great virtues of Habermas's public sphere are mentioned. Firstly, it focuses on the indissoluble like between the institutions and practices of mass public communication and the institutions and practices of democratic politics. The second virtue of Habermas's approach concentrate on the necessary material resource base for ant public. Its third virtue is to escape from the simple dichotomy of free market versus state control that dominates so much thinking about media policy.

==Non-liberal theories==

[[Oskar Negt]] &amp; [[Alexander Kluge]]  took a non-liberal view of public spheres, and argued that Habermas' reflections on the bourgeois public sphere should be supplemented with reflections on the ''proletarian public spheres'' and the ''public spheres of production''.&lt;ref name="Negt 1993"/&gt;

===Proletarian===

The distinction between bourgeois and proletarian public spheres is not mainly a distinction between classes. The proletarian public sphere is rather to be conceived of as the "excluded", vague, unarticulated impulses of resistance or resentment. The proletarian public sphere carries the subjective feelings, the egocentric malaise with the common public narrative, interests that are not socially valorized
:"As extraeconomic interests, they exist—precisely in the forbidden zones of fantasy beneath the surface of taboos—as stereotypes of a proletarian context of living that is organized in a merely rudimentary form."&lt;ref name="Negt &amp; Kluge 1993, p. 57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Negt|Kluge|1993|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bourgeois and proletarian public spheres are mutually defining: The proletarian public sphere carries the "left-overs" from the bourgeois public sphere, while the bourgeois public is based upon the productive forces of the underlying resentment:
:"In this respect, they " [i.e. the proletarian public spheres] " have two characteristics: in their defensive attitude toward society, their conservatism, and their subcultural character, they are once again mere objects; but they are, at the same time, the block of real life that goes against the valorization interest. As long as capital is dependent on living labor as a source of wealth, this element of the proletarian context of living cannot be extinguished through repression."&lt;ref name="Negt &amp; Kluge 1993, p. 57"/&gt;

===Production===

Negt and Kluge furthermore point out the necessity of considering a third dimension of the public spheres: The public spheres of production. The public spheres of production collect the impulses of resentment and instrumentalizes them in the productive spheres. The public spheres of production are wholly instrumental and have no critical impulse (unlike the bourgeois and proletarian spheres). The interests that are incorporated in the public sphere of production are given capitalist shape, and questions of their legitimately are thus neutralized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Negt|Kluge|1993|pp=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopolitical public===

By the end of the 20th century, the discussions about public spheres got a new biopolitical twist. Traditionally the public spheres had been contemplated as to how free agents transgress the private spheres. [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] have, drawing on the late [[Michel Foucault]]'s writings on [[biopolitics]], suggested that we reconsider the very distinction between public and private spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the traditional distinction is founded on a certain (capitalist) account of property that presupposes clear-cut separations between interests. This account of property is (according to Hardt and Negri) based upon a scarcity economy. The scarcity economy is characterized by an impossibility of sharing the goods. If "agent A" eats the bread, "agent B" cannot have it. The interests of agents are thus, generally, clearly separated.&lt;br/&gt;
However, with the evolving shift in the economy towards an informational materiality, in which value is based upon the informational significance, or the narratives surrounding the products, the clear-cut subjective separation is no longer obvious. Hardt and Negri see the [[open source]] approaches as examples of new ways of co-operation that illustrate how economic value is not founded upon exclusive possession, but rather upon collective potentialities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informational materiality is characterized by gaining value only through being shared. Hardt and Negri thus suggest that the [[commons]] become the focal point of analyses of public relations. The point being that with this shift it becomes possible to analyse how the very distinctions between the private and public are evolving.&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, Michael; Antonio Negri (2009), pp. vii–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RailTel Corporation of India Ltd.''' is a "[[Miniratna]]" (public sector) enterprise of [[Government of India]] focusing on providing [[broadband]] and [[VPN]] services. RailTel was formed in September 2000 with the objective of creating nationwide broadband, telecom and multimedia network, to modernise train control operation and safety system of [[Indian Railways]]. RailTel's network passes through around 5,000 stations across the country, covering all major commercial centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=100106 |title=RAILTEL Celebrates its Annual Day|date=18 October 2013 |publisher=Press Information Bureau, Indian government|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Indian Railways (IR) was initially solely dependent on the Department of Telecom (now [[BSNL]]) for their control and administrative communication circuits. To increase circuit efficiency, the Railways began building up its own communication systems from early 1970s based on overhead telephone lines, quad cables and [[microwave]] signalling. In 1983, the Railway Reforms Committee decided to introduce [[optical fibre cable]] (OFC) based communications in IR to provide safety, reliability, availability and serviceability through use of a dedicated network. The decision was also taken to create a network independent of the DoT and replace the existing microwave telecom systems (60% of which had reached end of life) with OFC.

Indian Railways commissioned the first OFC on the [[Western line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)|Churchgate–Virar line]] in Mumbai in 1988 for train operation and control purpose, which consisted of 60&amp;nbsp;km of network across 28 stations. The network was expanded in Central India with the commissioning of 900&amp;nbsp;km of OFC network in 1991–92 across Durg–Nagpur, Nagpur–Itarsi and Itarsi–Bhusaval sections of the [[Howrah–Nagpur–Mumbai line]], and in Eastern India with the commissioning of 60&amp;nbsp;km of OFC network in [[Tatanagar–Bilaspur section|Tatanagar–Chakradhrapur section]] of the same line.

The second National Telecom Policy in 1999 opened the National Long-Distance segment under favourable licensing conditions with revenue sharing to assist mobile network operators to spread their networks across India. In 2000, the Government announced the formation of a telecom corporation to build a nationwide broadband multimedia telecommunication network. RailTel was established in September 2000 as a [[Public Sector Undertaking]] (PSU), wholly owned by the Indian Railways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railtelindia.com/profile/about-us.html Rural Broadband Connectivity Provider in India | RailTel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wi-Fi and WiMax===
RailTel, in collaboration with Google, provides free [[WiFi]] access at selected railways stations across India. Google chose railway stations as the location to provide free WiFi because stations have access to reliable power supply and fibre provided by RailTel, and because the passengers at a station come from all demographics of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google teams up with RailTel to give free Wifi to all railway stations in India|url=http://www.indialivetoday.com/google-teams-up-with-railtel-to-give-free-wifi-to-all-railway-stations-in-india/16505.html|website=India Live Today|accessdate=25 August 2016|date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free WiFi service was launched at [[Mumbai Central railway station]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-central-gets-googles-highspeed-wifi-network/article8140702.ece Mumbai Central gets Google's Wi-Fi network – The Hindu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the service was expanded to 9 more railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google, RailTel expand free WiFi reach, cover 9 more stations|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/google-railtel-expand-free-wifi-reach-cover-9-more-stations-116041500438_1.html|publisher=''[[Business Standard]]''|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, Google announced that free Wi-Fi was available across 19 stations in India and was being used by over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1.5&amp;nbsp;million Indians enjoy high Speed Wi-Fi across 19 Railway Stations|url=http://googleindia.blogspot.in/2016/06/15-million-indians-enjoy-high-speed-wi.html|website=Official Google India Blog|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google and RailTel plan to provide free WiFi at 100 railway stations across the country by the end of 2016.

In September 2016, Google announced a public WiFi initiative called Google Station. Google plans to expand free WiFi coverage under the initiative to locations such as cafes and malls across India, and later expand worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byford|first1=Sam|title=Google Station is a new platform that aims to make public Wi-Fi better|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13070922/google-station-public-wi-fi-india|website=The Verge|accessdate=28 September 2016|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Google announced that it's Free Wi-Fi project is now powering 400 Indian railway stations. As a result, there are now more than 8 million people accessing the internet each month via the project.&lt;ref&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/google-says-free-wifi-available-at-400-railway-stations/articleshow/64492865.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railwire===
Based on its nationwide fibre network, RailTel offers various bandwidth intensive application to its customers. One such initiative is RailWire, a joint venture with MSOs to provide Voice, Video and Multimedia access on a single wire at a customer's home or office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RailTel to tie up with MSOs to expand internet base in rural T.N.|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/railtel-to-tie-up-with-msos-to-expand-internet-base-in-rural-tn/article5387079.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=25 November 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
RailTel has received the 12th National Awards for Excellence in Cost Management 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Railway PSU – "RailTel" Bags 12th National Awards for Excellence in Cost Management 2014|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=123344|accessdate=19 July 2015|publisher=Press Information Bureau of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Service-oriented communications (SOC)''' technologies are designed to be easily used in the context of [[Service-orientation|service-oriented]] architectures. These technologies are generally software based and are built more like a business application than a traditional PBX business [[communications system]]. Service-oriented communications systems allow their services to participate in [[business process]]es. They make their services available to other business applications within and SOA and allow for reuse of the services.
The goal of service-oriented communications is to enable business environments to build communications into their business processes, enabling more streamlined collaboration among people within the business. It typically assumes that certain services are provided in the context of an SOA service provider. This is often in the form of a suite of [[web service]]s, but may also be attached to other means of sharing the services such as an enterprise system bus (ESB).

The communications part of SOC
Enterprise communications have traditionally been provided by closed, stand-alone PBX systems. Installed in a separate phone room or wiring closet, operated over a different wiring infrastructure, known only by the telecom manager, these systems ran independently from every other aspect of the business.

Today’s business-savvy [[chief information officer]]s (CIOs) are exploring ways in which [[information technology]] can be better leveraged to improve the efficiency and productivity of the enterprise. In practice, CIOs are embracing the concepts of [[service-oriented architecture]]s and rethinking how the different business systems in use within the enterprise can be designed to allow each system to leverage the benefits of any other system.
The maturing of web service technology has provided a real framework for allowing one system to leverage the services of another according to the principles of a service-oriented architecture. Complex business systems can now work together to deliver solutions in highly customized ways to end users. Increasingly, applications are adapting to the specific needs of users rather than users being forced to adapt to the available functionality of applications.

== Web service technology ==

As the Internet grew from a forum for sharing information to a marketplace for doing business, a technology matured that allowed computers to transact with each other more easily. Out of these Internet roots, web service technology was born.

The general goal of web services is to construct elements of [[business logic]], services, which can be very easily used by other applications. The services themselves hide the complexity of their business logic from the consumers through simple interfaces that allow the services to be reused in many different applications. The service and the consumer are described as being [[Loose coupling|loosely coupled]], an approach that allows complex composite solutions to be developed through leveraging multiple web services.

There are a number of key elements to web service technology…

* XML ([[Extensible Markup Language|eXtensible Markup Language]]) is the core language of web service technology. It provides a platform neutral way to describe the data associated with any service transaction.
* SOAP ([[SOAP|Simple Object Access Protocol]]) is the preferred means by which an application invokes a web service. The protocol itself is written in XML.
* WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) is the specification of the interface that a web service exposes to consumers. It describes the set of operations that the service makes available. The WSDL is also written in XML.
Advantages of web services
* Loosely coupled—the high degree of abstraction that exists between the implementation and the consumption of the service frees the web service client and the web service provider from needing any knowledge of each other beyond inputs and outputs
* Platform neutral—web services can be provided by or invoked on most, if not all, platforms today, even legacy platforms
* Development language neutral—people are developing web services using C/C++, C#, Java, [[Visual Basic]], Python and others
* Standards are architecture neutral—these do not enforce [[client–server]], [[peer-to-peer]] or any other model, although practical implementation issues currently drive developers to client–server
* Web services leverage existing standards—standards that are already in place for conventional [[web server]] applications, including HTTP, secure sockets and authentication
* Relatively lightweight—so they can be easily deployed to small devices for example PDAs and [[Smartphone|SmartPhones]].

The '''sex-positive movement''' is a [[social movement]] and [[philosophical movement]] that promotes and embraces [[sexuality]] and sexual expression, with an emphasis on [[safer sex|safe]] and [[consensual sex]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allenagabosch.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/a-sex-positive-renaissance/|title=A Sex Positive Renaissance|date=2014-12-08|work=Allena Gabosch|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wgac.colostate.edu/education/the-body-is-political/sex-positivity/|title=Sex Positivity|work=Women and Gender Advocacy Center|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Sex-positivity''' is "an attitude towards [[human sexuality]] that regards all consensual sexual activities as fundamentally healthy and pleasurable, encouraging sexual pleasure and experimentation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The sex-positive movement also advocates for comprehensive [[sex education]] and safe sex as part of its campaign."&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/magazine/teaching-good-sex.html|title=Teaching Good Sex|last=Abraham|first=Laurie|date=2011-11-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The movement generally makes no moral distinctions among types of sexual activities, regarding these choices as matters of personal preference.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ivanski, C., &amp; Kohut, T.

==Overview==
The terms and concept of '''sex-positive''' (German: ''sexuell positiv'') (or, alternately '''sex-affirmative''' (''sexuell bejahend'')) and '''sex-negative''' (''sexuell negativ'') are generally attributed to [[Wilhelm Reich]]. His hypothesis was that some societies view sexual expression as essentially good and healthy, while others have a generally negative view of sexuality and seek to [[Psychological repression|repress]] and control libido.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Johansson, Warren. 1990. "[http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Negpos.pdf Sex Negative, Sex Positive]". In: Dynes WR (ed). Encyclopedia of Homosexuality. New York: Garland. p 1182–1183. {{ISBN|0-8153-1880-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms used to describe this concept include ''pro-sex'', or ''pro-sexuality''.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Wilhelm Reich, The Invasion of Compulsory Sex-Morality (''Der Einbruch der Sexualmoral'', 1932); The Sexual Revolution (''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf]]'', 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sex-positive movement does not, in general, make moral or ethical distinctions between [[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]] sex, or [[masturbation]], regarding these choices as matters of personal preference.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Ivanski, C., &amp; Kohut, T. (2017). Exploring definitions of sex positivity through thematic analysis. ''The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, 26''(3), 216-225. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.3138/cjhs.2017-0017&lt;/nowiki&gt; Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://libproxy.highpoint.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1988838533?accountid=11411&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other sex-positive positions include acceptance of [[BDSM]] and [[polyamory]] as well as [[asexuality]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The sex-positive movement is also concerned with the teaching of [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive and accurate sex education]] in schools.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Some sex-positive theorists have analyzed sex-positivity in terms of the intersection of race/culture, gender, sexuality, class, nationality, and spirituality.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Because of the vastness of the sex-positivity movement, it has been challenging for people to reach an agreed upon definition of the term "sex-positivity." &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Several definitions of sex-positivity have been offered by sexologist [[Carol Queen]]:&lt;blockquote href="LGBT"&gt;''Sex-positive'', a term that's coming into cultural awareness, isn't a dippy love-child celebration of [[orgone]] – it's a simple yet radical affirmation that we each grow our own passions on a different medium, that instead of having two or three or even half a dozen sexual orientations, we should be thinking in terms of millions. "Sex-positive" respects each of our unique sexual profiles, even as we acknowledge that some of us have been damaged by a culture that tries to eradicate sexual difference and possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Queen, Carol (1997). ''Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture''. Pittsburgh (Cleis Press). {{ISBN|1-57344-073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote href="social movement"&gt;It’s the cultural philosophy that understands sexuality as a ''potentially'' positive force in one’s life, and it can, of course, be contrasted with sex-negativity, which sees sex as problematic, disruptive, dangerous. Sex-positivity allows for and in fact celebrates [[sexual diversity]], differing desires and relationships structures, and individual choices based on consent.&lt;ref&gt;Queen, Carol; Comella, Lynn (2008). "The Necessary Revolution: Sex-Positive Feminism in the Post-Barnard Era". ''The Communication Review''. '''11''' (3): 274–291. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.1080/10714420802306783|10.1080/10714420802306783]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of the sex-positivity movement==
''Main articles: [[1960s counterculture]], [[Free love|Free Love]] and [[Sexual revolution]]''

In general use, the term [[sexual liberation]] is used to describe a socio-political movement, witnessed from the 1960s into the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[David Allyn|Allyn, David]] (2000). ''Make love, not war: the sexual revolution, an unfettered history''. Warner Trade Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-316-03930-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term has been used at least since the late 1920s and is often attributed as being influenced by [[Freud]]'s writing on sexual liberation and psychosexual issues, as well as [[Wilhelm Reich]], who originally coined the term.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

During the 1960s, a shift in the ways people thought about sexuality began to take place, heralding a period of de-conditioning in some circles away from old world antecedents, and developing new codes of sexual behavior, many of which have since been integrated into the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;''Time.'' 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s also heralded a new culture of "[[free love]]" with millions of young people embracing the [[hippie]] ethos and preaching the power of [[love]] and the beauty of [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] as a natural part of ordinary life. Hippies believed that sex and sexuality were natural biological phenomena which should be neither denied nor repressed. Changes in attitudes reflected a perception that traditional views on sexuality were both hypocritical and [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]].

Sexual liberalization heralded a new ethos in experimenting with open sex in and outside of marriage, [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[public nudity]], [[gay liberation]], legalized [[abortion]], [[interracial marriage]], a return to [[natural childbirth]], [[women's rights]] and [[feminism]].

[[Celibacy|Celibate]] hippies were not critical of those who chose the paths of "free love" and "sexual liberalization". In the late 1970s and 1980s, newly won sexual freedoms were exploited by big businesses looking to capitalize on a more open society, with the advent of public [[pornography]].

Historian [[David Allyn]] argues that the sexual revolution was a time of "coming-out": about premarital sex, masturbation, erotic fantasies, pornography use, and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Sex-positive feminism ==
{{main|Sex-positive feminism}}

Sex-positive feminism, also known as '''pro-sex feminism''', '''sex-radical feminism''', or '''sexually liberal feminism''', is a movement that began in the early 1980s. Some became involved in the sex-positive feminist movement in response to efforts by [[Anti-pornography movement#Feminist objections|anti-pornography feminists]], such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Robin Morgan]] and [[Dorchen Leidholdt]], to put [[pornography]] at the center of a feminist explanation of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, W (2002). ''Liberty for Women: Freedom and Feminism in the Twenty-First Century''. Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; This period of intense debate and acrimony between sex-positive and anti-pornography feminists during the early 1980s is often referred to as the "[[Feminist Sex Wars]]". Other sex-positive feminists became involved, not in opposition to other feminists, but in direct response to what they saw as patriarchal control of sexuality. Some authors who have advocated sex-positive feminism include [[Ellen Willis]], [[Susie Bright]], [[Patrick Califia]], [[Gayle Rubin]], [[Carol Queen]], [[Avedon Carol]], [[Tristan Taormino]], [[Diana Cage]], [[Nina Hartley]], and [[Betty Dodson]].

== Opposition to the sex-positive movement ==
In opposition, sex-negativity takes on conservative definitions of [[human sexuality]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Under this guise, sex is seen as a [[Fornication|destructive force except under the contract of a marriage]]. Sexual acts are ranked hierarchically, with marital heterosexuality at the top of the hierarchy and masturbation, homosexuality, and other sexualities that deviate from societal expectations closer to the bottom.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Rubin, Gayle (1984). Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality. In Carole S. Vance (Ed.), ''Pleasure and Danger: exploring female sexuality'', pp. 267–319.

== Sex-positivity in the 21st Century ==
Since the early 2000s, the sex-positivity movement has continued to move closer into the mainstream.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The advent of [[social media]] has made the sex-positivity more accessible by giving advocates of the movement platforms to promote their beliefs to a wide audience of followers. By extending the reach of the movement, sex-positivity has come to be inclusive of all sorts of sex and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Ivanski, C., &amp; Kohut, T. (2017). Exploring definitions of sex positivity through thematic analysis. ''The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, 26''(3), 216-225. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.3138/cjhs.2017-0017&lt;/nowiki&gt; Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://libproxy.highpoint.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1988838533?accountid=11411&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shame|Shaming]] has become an area of particular interest within the sex-positivity movement, encouraging people to be more open and accepting of the different experiences people have with sex and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Fahs, Breanne. “‘Freedom to’ and ‘Freedom from’: A New Vision for Sex-Positive Politics.” Vol. 17, 12 May 2014, pp. 267–290., doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/1363460713516334&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slut-shaming]], prude-shaming and [[Kink (sexual)|kink]]-shaming have all been challenged by the sex-positivity movement in an effort to allow all people to feel supported by and included in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, Deborah L., Stephanie M. Anderson, and Kimberly Belmonte. "Mobilizing Metaphor: Considering Complexities, Contradictions, and Contexts in Adolescent Girls' and Young Women's Sexual Agency." ''Sex Roles'', vol. 73, no. 7-8, 2015, pp. 298-310'', ProQuest'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://libproxy.highpoint.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1712463168?accountid=11411&lt;/nowiki&gt;, doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-015-0510-0&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop culture has also played a large role in bringing the sex-positivity movement into the mainstream. Celebrities, including [[Lady Gaga]], [[Amber Rose]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Taylor Swift]] and many others, have spoken publicly about their experiences with slut-shaming, sexuality, sexual assault, body acceptance and overall sexual health and responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.shape.com/celebrities/interviews/9-female-celebrities-get-candid-about-sexual-health|title=9 Celebs Getting Candid About Sexual Health|date=2015-09-25|work=Shape Magazine|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yourtango.com/2017300875/these-9-sex-positive-women-celebrities-should-be-your-role-models|title=These 9 Sex-Positive Women Celebrities Should Be Your Role Models|date=2017-03-24|work=YourTango|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Viceland]], an American television station, began airing a sex-positive series called ''[[List of programs broadcast by Viceland|Slutever]]'', hosted by [[Karley Sciortino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Slutever|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7829456/|others=Karley Sciortino, Buck Angel, Ash Armand|accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hieronymus Bosch 075.jpg|thumb|A detail from [[The Haywain Triptych]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
A '''stabbing''' is [[penetrating trauma|penetration]] with a sharp or pointed object at close range. ''Stab'' connotes purposeful action, as by an [[Assassination|assassin]] or [[murder]]er, but it is also possible to accidentally stab oneself or others. Stabbing differs from [[Slashing (crime)|slashing]] or [[cutting]] in that the motion of the object used in a stabbing generally moves perpendicular to and directly into the victim's body, rather than being drawn across it.

Stabbings today are common among [[gangs]] and in [[prisons]] because knives are cheap, easy to acquire (or manufacture), easily concealable and relatively effective. In 2013 about 8 million stabbings occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=22 August 2015|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743–800|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Assassinato luigi.jpg|thumb|After being attacked and stabbed, empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth of Austria]] boarded a ship, unaware of the severity of her condition as consequence of an [[acute stress reaction]]. Bleeding to death from a puncture wound to the heart, Elisabeth's last words were, "What happened to me?"]]
Stabbings have been common throughout human history and were the means used to [[assassinate]] a number of distinguished historical figures, such as Second [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] and [[Roman emperor]]s [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Caligula]].

In Japan, the historical practice of stabbing oneself deliberately in [[ritual suicide]] is known as ''[[seppuku]]'' (more colloquially ''hara-kiri'', literally "belly-cutting" since it involves cutting open the abdomen). The ritual is highly codified, and the person committing suicide is assisted by a "second" who is entrusted to decapitate him cleanly (and thus expedite death and prevent an undignified spectacle) once he has made the abdominal wound.

==Mechanism==
The human [[skin]] has a somewhat elastic property as a self-defense; when the human body is stabbed by a thin object such as a small kitchen knife, the skin often closes tightly around the object and closes again if the object is removed, which can trap some blood within the body. It has thus been speculated that the [[fuller (weapon)|fuller]], an elongated concave depression in a metal blade, functions to let blood out of the body in order to cause more damage. This misconception has led to fullers becoming widely known as "blood grooves". The fuller is actually a structural reinforcement of the blade similar in design to a metal I-beam used in construction. However, [[internal bleeding]] is just as dangerous as external bleeding; if enough blood vessels are severed to cause serious injury, the skin's elasticity will do nothing to prevent blood from exiting the circulatory system and accumulating uselessly in other parts of the body.

Death from stabbing is caused by [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], severe [[blood loss]], infection, or loss of function of an essential organ such as the [[heart]] and/or [[lung]]s.

==Medical treatment==
{{further|Stab wound}}
Although previously a victim of abdominal stabbing would be subject to exploratory surgery [[laparotomy]], it is now considered safe not to operate if the patient is stable.  In that case, they should be observed for signs of decompensation indicating a serious injury.  In the event that the patient initially presents stabbing injuries and is unstable, laparotomy should be initiated to discover and rectify any internal injury.

==Autopsy examination==
When someone who has sustained a stab wound dies, the body is autopsied and the wound is inspected by a [[forensic pathologist]]. Such examination can yield valuable information about the weapon used to produce the injury. From the external appearance and internal findings, the pathologist will usually be able to offer opinion about the dimensions of the weapon including the width and minimum possible length of the blade. It is possible to determine whether the weapon was single edged or double edged.&lt;ref name=Biju&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=Biju|author2=Ajay Balachandran |author3=Anu Sasidharan |author4=Ramakrishanan U K |author5=Prem T N |author6=Thomas Jerry |title=Unusual Incised Stab Wound Produced by a Single Edged Weapon: A Case Report|journal=Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology|date=22 July 2013|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1–3|doi=10.5958/j.0973-9130|url=http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:ijfmt&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=2&amp;article=001|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes factors like the taper of the blade and movement of knife in the wound can also be determined. [[Bruise]]s or [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] may give information about the [[Knife#Parts|guard]].&lt;ref name=Biju/&gt;

'''Teen dating violence''' is the [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[psychological abuse|psychological]] / [[emotional abuse|emotional]] [[abuse]] (or [[violence]]) within a dating relationship among adolescents.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web | last = CDC | author-link = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Teen dating violence | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = June 29, 2015 | accessdate = November 15, 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intimate partner violence]] (IPV) has been a well examined and documented phenomenon in adults; however, there has not been nearly as much study on violence in adolescent dating relationships, and it is therefore not as well understood. The research has mainly focused on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chu | first1 = Ann T. | last2 = Sundermann | first2 = Jane M. | last3 = DePrince | first3 = Anne P. | contribution = Intimate partner violence in adolescent romantic relationships | editor-last1 = Donohue | editor-first1 = William T. | editor-last2 = Benuto | editor-first2 = Lorraine T. | editor-last3 = Woodward Tolle | editor-first3 = Lauren | title = Handbook of adolescent health psychology | page = 193 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781461466338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=KX29BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimate partner violence (IPV) in adolescents is an important realm of study as, in addition to the usual negative effects of abuse, this violence occurs at a critical period in the social and mental development of a person.  This is also an important topic from a [[gender studies]] perspective as almost 32% of male adolescents engage in some form of violence, whether sexual, physical or emotional, towards their partners while adolescent violence from females is nearly half of that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Peralta | first2 = Robert | title = The relationship between drinking and violence in an adolescent population: does gender matter? | journal = [[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1080/016396202317192008 | date = January 2002 | ref = harv }} [http://www3.uakron.edu/publications/relationshiprp.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the United States public health authority, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), "[a]dolescents and adults are often unaware that teens experience dating violence."&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

==Gender differences==
{{see also|Domestic violence#Gender differences}}
The literature on IPV among adolescents indicates that the rates are similar for the number of girls and boys in heterosexual relationships who report experiencing IPV, or that girls in heterosexual relationships are more likely than their male counterparts to report perpetrating IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Knox | first1 = Lyndee | last2 = Lomonaco | first2 = Carmela | last3 = Alpert | first3 = Elaine | contribution = Adolescent relationship violence | editor-last1 = Mitchell | editor-first1 = Connie | editor-last2 = Anglin | editor-first2 = Deirdre | title = Intimate partner violence: a health-based perspective | pages = 514, 516 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199720729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q04QO7UmyowC&amp;pg=PA514 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Jessica R. | last2 = Ghandour | first2 = Reem M. | last3 = Kub | first3 = Joan E. | title = Female perpetration of violence in heterosexual intimate relationships: adolescence through adulthood | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–249 | doi = 10.1177/1524838008324418 | pmc = 2663360 | date = October 2008 | ref = harv | pmid=18936281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ely et al. stated that, unlike domestic violence in general, equal rates of IPV perpetration is a unique characteristic with regard adolescent dating violence, and that this is "perhaps because the period of adolescence, a special developmental state, is accompanied by sexual characteristics that are distinctly different from the characteristics of adult."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Ely | first1 = Gretchen | last2 = Dulmus | first2 = Catherine N. | last3 = Wodarski | first3 = John S. | contribution = Adolescent dating violence | editor-last1 = Rapp-Paglicci | editor-first1 = Lisa A. | editor-last2 = Roberts | editor-first2 = Albert R. | editor-last3 = Wodarski | editor-first3 = John S. | title = Handbook of violence | page = 36 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780471214441 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtOvUULaNZEC&amp;pg=PA36 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wekerle and Wolfe theorized that "a mutually coercive and violent dynamic may form during adolescence, a time when males and females are more equal on a physical level" and that this "physical equality allows girls to assert more power through physical violence than is possible for an adult female attacked by a fully physically mature man."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"/&gt;

Regarding studies that indicate that girls are as likely or more likely than boys to commit IPV, the authors emphasize that substantial differences exist between the genders, including that girls are significantly more likely than boys to report having experienced severe IPV, such as being threatened with a weapon, punched, strangled, beaten, burned, or raped, and are also substantially more likely than boys to need  psychological help or experience physical injuries that require medical help for the abuse, and to report sexual violence as a part of dating violence. They are also more likely to take IPV more seriously. By contrast, boys are more likely to report experiencing less severe acts, such as being pinched, slapped, scratched or kicked. Girls are more likely to report committing less serious forms of IPV, including as a means of self-defense, whereas boys are more likely to report committing more severe acts of IPV, including threats, physical violence and controlling a partner.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; That girls are more likely to engage in IPV as a result of self-defense is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{citation | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Katie M. | last2 = Dardis | first2 = Christina M. | last3 = Gidycz | first3 = Christine A. | contribution = The role of victimization experiences in adolescent girls and young women's aggression in dating relationships | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 2, Part I.

==Controversies and arguments==
There is a common misconception that aggression is stable over time. That is, young people who are labeled as or considered to be violent and aggressive at any point in time are then assumed to be dangerous for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loeber | first1 = Rolf | last2 = Stouthamer-Loeber | first2 = Magda | title = Development of juvenile aggression and violence: some common misconceptions and controversies | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–259 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.242 | pmid = 9491750 | date = February 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a contentious issue because there is a desire to protect both parties involved (or that have the potential to become involved) in teen dating violence. While classifying the perpetrator as a threat may be detrimental to his or her life and future relationships, not classifying the perpetrator this way may put future partners at risk.

There is considerable debate over whether we as a society have an accurate picture of the prevalence and severity of teen dating violence by gender. It is important to note that although male and female adolescents do not differ in "overall frequency of violence in dating relationships," females are subject to "significantly higher levels of severe violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molidor | first1 = Christian | last2 = Tolman | first2 = Richard M. | title = Gender and contextual factors in adolescent dating violence | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–194 | doi = 10.1177/1077801298004002004 | pmid = 12295440 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact begs the question of whether abuse should be evaluated based on “severity” and how that can and should be measured, or if all abuse should be considered equally harmful.

[[Age of consent]] is an issue that cannot be ignored in the discussion of teenage dating violence. Teenage sex is regulated in such a way that "age of consent laws render teenagers below a certain age incapable of consent to sexual activity with adults, and sometimes with peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sutherland | first = Kate | title = From jailbird to jailbait: age of consent laws and the construction of teenage sexualities | journal = [[William &amp; Mary Law School#Law journals|William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–349 | ssrn = 1586883 | date = Spring 2003 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wmjwl9&amp;div=20 | ref = harv }} [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=wmjowl Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the adult may be just a few months older than the minor. There are a number of states in which "age of consent statutes are used to prosecute consensual sex between two persons both under the age of consent." This type of prosecution has been deemed unconstitutional in some states by citing violation of privacy rights, but remains in effect in other states. Sexual behavior and aggression can be so deeply intertwined that the legality of underage consensual sex is sure to have an effect on teen dating violence.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Nature vs. nurture==
{{OR section|date=September 2015}}
Significant research has been done on the causes behind violent behavior in adolescent dating relationships with the intention of guiding the creation of dating violence prevention programs, and in turn has provided findings on the roles of nature and nurture in the development of such behavior with a strong favor towards nurture factors. A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health examined the potential association between a spectrum of childhood adverse experiences and physical violence in relationships before age 21 for both members. The subjects were asked questions about violence in their adolescent relationships, as either victim or perpetrator, and their childhood surrounding twelve different adversities: parental death, parental divorce, long-term separation from parent, parental mental illness, parental substance abuse disorder, parental criminality, inter-parental violence, serious physical illness in childhood, physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and family economic adversity. The results demonstrated a strong positive correlation between ten out of the twelve childhood adversities and physically violent behavior in a teen relationship, with 13.8% responding with experiences of sexual violence, and 11.6% experiencing inter-parental violence. This points to a strong influence of experience, or nature, on violent tendencies in adolescent relationships. Multiple other studies corroborate these findings, citing childhood bullying, assault, and maltreatment as significant indicators for future violence in adolescent dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Breslau | first2 = Joshua | last3 = Chung | first3 = W.J. Joanie | last4 = Green | first4 = Jennifer Greif | last5 = McLaughlin | first5 = Katie A. | last6 = Kessler | first6 = Ronald C. | title = Adverse childhood experiences and risk of physical violence in adolescent dating relationships | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 65 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–1013 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2009.105429 | pmid = 21321063 | date = November 2011 | ref = harv | pmc=3686487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been little explicit study of the relationship between nature and teen dating violence, there has been proven correlation between testosterone levels and violent tendencies that could come to fruition in adolescent dating relationships. Higher testosterone levels “manifests itself in various intensities and forms from; thoughts, anger, verbal aggressiveness, competition, dominance behavior, to physical violence.”  A study published in the International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism reported, “Testosterone plays a significant role in the arousal of these behavioral manifestations in the brain centers involved in aggression and on the development of the muscular system that enables their realization. There is evidence that testosterone levels are higher in individuals with aggressive behavior, such as prisoners who have committed violent crimes.” However, the study also noted that many cases of high testosterone levels are disarmed through socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Batrinos | first = Menelaos L. | title = Testosterone and aggressive behavior in man | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–568 | doi = 10.5812/ijem.3661 | pmc = 3693622 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv | pmid=23843821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, because children are exposed to relationships early in their life through their parents and being so malleable at a young age, most evidence points to an adverse experience or experiences in childhood as fodder for such behavior in adolescence.

==Prevalence and approaches==
The literature on IPV among adolescents primarily focuses on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;

====Statistics====
While dating, domestic and sexual violence affect women regardless of their age, teens and young women are especially vulnerable. Young people ages 12 to 19 experience the highest rates of rape and sexual assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Truman | first1 = Jennifer L. | last2 = Rand | first2 = Michael R. | title = Criminal victimization, 2009 | url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv09.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = October 2010 }} {{NCJ|231327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people age 18 and 19 experience the highest rates of stalking. Approximately one in three adolescent girls in the United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner—a figure that far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence affecting youth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Antoinette | title = Interpersonal and physical dating violence among teens | journal = The National Council on Crime and Delinquency Focus | date = September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425153501/http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | url = http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Andrew Green|Mark Green]], former Wisconsin Representative said "if the numbers we see in domestic violence (dating violence) were applied to terrorism or gang violence, the entire country would be up in arms, and it would be the lead story on the news every night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Savacool | first = Julia | title = Our most important mission ever: stop violence against women now | url = http://www.marieclaire.com/world-reports/news/domestic-violence-stop | work = [[Marie Claire]] | publisher = [[Hearst Corporation]] | date = 10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Women's Health'', "81% of parents surveyed either believed dating violence is not an issue or admit they don't know if it's an issue",&lt;ref name=UMHS&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff writer | title = Who's affected by dating violence? | journal = Women's Health | page = 3 | date = June–July 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905041051/http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | archive-date = 5 September 2008 | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | ref = harv }} Sources: [[Futures Without Violence|Family Violence Prevention Fund]] and [[Advocates for Youth]]&lt;/ref&gt; this is concerning because of the growth of dating abuse in teenagers relationships.&lt;ref name=UMHS /&gt; Dating violence has advanced{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} through the years by the means of communication technology.  A survey conducted by Teenage Research Unlimited stated that "[10] percent of teens have been threatened physically via e-mail, IM, text messaging, chat rooms, etc."

A 2008 [[meta-analysis]], which examined 62 [[empirical research]] studies between 1996 and 2006, relating to domestic violence in heterosexual intimate relationships from adolescence through to adulthood in the United States, reported on research findings that consistently show that adolescent females commit significantly more acts of domestic violence in intimate relationships than adolescent males. It stated, however, that the "data also suggest that females who commit acts of domestic violence may experience more violent or frequent IPV victimization than males" and that "[t]he highest rates [for female-perpetrated IPV] were found for emotional violence, followed by physical and sexual violence. Prevalence rates varied widely within each population, most likely due to methodological and sampling differences across studies." The authors added, "Few longitudinal studies existed, limiting the extent to which we could identify developmental patterns associated with female perpetrated intimate partner violence." They found a few studies which reported prevalence rates of IPV perpetration among females at two or more time points, which they stated made "it difficult to obtain a clear picture of the developmental patterns associated with this type of violence." There was also only one study that reported on prevalence rates over time for female perpetrated IPV among adolescents. "This study found a significant increase in prevalence over a six month period; however, they measured lifetime perpetration of IPV, therefore, it is unclear if there was an actual increase or simply an accumulation of violence," stated the authors. "Together, these studies provide very limited evidence that female perpetration of IPV may follow a similar developmental trajectory as other forms of violence. [...] Unfortunately, many of the studies included in this review used modified or alternative instruments making it difficult to accurately compare prevalence estimates."&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

In a 2009 survey, the CDC found that 9.8% of high school students in the U.S. reported having been intentionally physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend in the preceding 12&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; A 2011 CDC nationwide survey of the U.S. population reported that 23% of females and 14% of males who ever experienced rape, other physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner first experienced some form of partner violence between 11 and 17 years of age.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The ages between 16 and 24 are when youth are the most susceptible to dating violence. Also, according to the CDC, one in ten teens will be physically abused between seventh and twelfth grade. Because of this abuse, victims are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, employ precarious sexual conduct, develop eating disorders, and attempt suicide.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The above numbers are notable in their magnitude and in their discrepancy, indicating that at some point between birth and high school a huge number of males are learning that it is useful and acceptable to abuse their dating partners in some way. The reciprocal of males learning violent behaviors is that women are not learning this fact and are instead learning through our culture and through violence directed at them that they are to be submissive. Males learning violent behaviors coupled with females thinking it normative creates a cycle of women being abused, learning to accept it and imparting this idea to their children and repeating the process. According to a study conducted by Susan M. Sanders she found that many adolescents do not always view aggressive behavior as violent or abusive and roughly 77.6% young girls agreed that after a physical altercation such as being kicked by their partner that they would cease to date them. The study conducted demonstrated that many adolescents, primarily females were more susceptible to leave only after a physical altercation took place. With these studies it was found that once a physical altercation took place the victim  would then view it as abusive and eventually desire to leave the relationship.&lt;ref&gt; Susan, M. S.(2003) Teen Dating Violence: The Invisible Peril. New York. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent dating violence is a subject which must be understood in order for true equality between the sexes to be achieved and to help stop partner violence in adults before it occurs.

====Legislation====
In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) states that "[p]olicymakers can play a role in preventing teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;{{cite web | title = Teen dating violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609073629/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/teen-dating-violence.aspx | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url = http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=17582 | website = ncsl.org | publisher = [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] | date = May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lists those states that currently have laws requiring school boards to develop and adopt programs to address this issue. Further, according to NCSL "[i]n 2011 at least eight states have introduced legislation to address teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt; On January 31, 2011, President Obama proclaimed February 2011 to be "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = President of the United States | author-link = President of the United States | title = Presidential proclamation--National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2011 | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/31/presidential-proclamation-national-teen-dating-violence-awareness-and-pr | website = whitehouse.gov | publisher = [[White House]] | date = 31 January 2011 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the U.S. first recognized "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week", sponsored by Senator [[Mike Crapo]], to "increase public awareness and education of the prevalence of teen dating violence among our nation's teens".&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;{{cite web | last = Crapo | first = Mike (Sen.) | author-link = Mike Crapo | title = Teen dating violence awareness week | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130219164115/http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | archive-date = 19 February 2013 | url = http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | website = crapo.senate.gov | date = 19 February 2013 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first week in February was so recognized through 2009. Beginning in 2010, Senator Crapo joined the Department of Justice in recognizing the month of February as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt;

====National helpline and organizations====
The National Dating Abuse Helpline, created by [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]], is a 24-hour nationwide Web-based and telephone resource created to help teens and young people who are experiencing dating abuse. They offer information on building healthy relationships and how to recognize warning signs. It is the only helpline in the country serving all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hingorani | first = Jitin | title = New national teen dating abuse helpline to provide urgent support for teens | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090214073216/http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | archive-date = 14 February 2009 | url = http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | website = jwi.org | publisher = Resources, Training &amp; Education: Domestic Violence Newsletters, Jewish Women International | date = March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a diagram from the book ''The Automated Society'',&lt;ref&gt; Bloomfield, Masse, ''The Automated Society'', Masefield Books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield defines the history of humanity beginning over two million years ago and ending over a hundred thousand years in the future. The diagram is base on biological [[punctuated equilibrium]] and a parallel [[cultural evolution]]. The predictions of the [[future]] follow what has happened in the past.

The diagram of [[history]] shows humanity having long periods of stability interrupted with short periods of transition. Humanity is currently experiencing one of those short periods of transition, from a stable agricultural period going through a transitional [[industrial society]] leading to a stable automated period. [[Productivity]] is the key to the transition; when it is impossible to increase productivity, humanity will have arrived at the automated society.

Before humanity enters the automated society, we will suffer from two near term trends. One trend is the relentlessly increasing number of human beings. The second is the relentlessly decreasing number of jobs. Jobs will be eliminated by substituting men with machines. An example of this is agriculture where once in the peasant society there were ninety percent of the people working as farmers. With the introduction of tractors, only three percent of Americans work on the farm.

Once the problems of the lack of jobs, increased [[pollution]] and fewer natural resources are solved and the food factory put in operation, there should be a reconciliation of man to [[automation]]. In the automated society, men will live in affluence along with a total control of [[population]]. The one place where man will have an unlimited future will be in space. [[Space]] can provide for an unlimited increase in population and potentially the introduction of new human biological species.

The '''Three Rural Issues''', or '''San Nong''' ({{zh|s=三农|t=三農|p=sān nóng}}), refers to three issues relating to rural development in [[People's Republic of China|mainland China]].  Specifically, these issues are [[agriculture]], [[rural|rural area]]s and [[farmer]]s.  The Three Rural Issues were highlighted by [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wen Jiabao]] as areas of rural development in China that need work.

At the [[2006 National People's Congress]], the Three Rural Issues were especially emphasized throughout Wen Jiabao's speech on the workings of the government in 2005 and the direction of the government for the year 2006. In the rural areas, agricultural reforms had made the peasants better-off until the 1990s when land supply became insufficient and the cost of the means of production was soaring. As a result, the income of the peasants was greatly reduced. Today, the "three problem of peasantry, rural areas and agriculture" are still a major concern of the government.

==Content==

===Issue of Agriculture===
In general, the issue is how to industrialize agriculture in China. It includes (1) increasing the marketization level of agricultural production and operation, and stabilizing the prices of agricultural products; (2) changing the situation of smallholder economic agriculture, achieving economies of scale of agricultural production and operation; (3) guaranteeing the food security in China. 

===Issue of Rural Areas===
This is particularly reflected in the disparity of economic and cultural development between urban and rural areas. It is mainly caused by the dual segmentation based on the household registration system.

===Issue of Farmers===

It includes improving the income level of farmers, alleviating burdens of farmers, increasing the cultural qualities of farmers, and safeguarding the rights of farmers.

Not to be confused with migration of rural workers to Cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7127">'''Triadic closure''' is a concept in [[social network]] theory, first suggested by [[Germany|German]] [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Georg Simmel]] in his 1908 book ''Soziologie'' [''Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation''].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/style/17facebook.html?pagewanted=print Georg Simmel], originator of the concept: "Facebook" article at [[the New York Times]] website. Retrieved on December 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Triadic closure is the property among three nodes A, B, and C, such that if a strong tie exists between A-B and A-C, there is a weak or strong tie between B-C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/complexity/course/emergence06/bookreviews/kmaffei.html Working concept] of triadic closure: book review of [[Duncan Watts]]' "[[Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age]]" at the ''Serendip'' ([[Bryn Mawr College]]) website. Retrieved on December 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This property is too extreme to hold true across very large, complex networks, but it is a useful simplification of reality that can be used to understand and predict networks.&lt;ref name=Easley&gt;Easley, D, &amp; Kleinberg, J. (2010). Networks, crowds, and markets: reasoning about a highly connected world. Cornell, NY: Cambridge Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Triadic closure was made popular by [[Mark Granovetter]] in his 1973 article ''The Strength of Weak Ties''.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, M. (1973). "[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf The Strength of Weak Ties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216103216/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf |date=2008-02-16 }}", American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 78, Issue 6, May 1360-80.&lt;/ref&gt; There he synthesized the theory of [[cognitive balance]] first introduced by [[Fritz Heider]] in 1946 with a Simmelian understanding of social networks. In general terms, cognitive balance refers to the propensity of two individuals to want to feel the same way about an object. If the triad of three individuals is not closed, then the person connected to both of the individuals will want to close this triad in order to achieve closure in the relationship network.

==Measurements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
The two most common measures of triadic closure for a graph are (in no particular order) the [[clustering coefficient]] and transitivity for that graph.

===Clustering coefficient===
One measure for the presence of triadic closure is [[clustering coefficient]], as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;G = (V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be an undirected simple graph (i.e., a graph having no self-loops or multiple edges) with V the set of vertices and E the set of edges. Also, let &lt;math&gt;N = |V|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M = |E|&lt;/math&gt; denote the number of vertices and edges in G, respectively, and let &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; be the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of vertex i.

Then we can define a triangle among the triple of vertices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to be a set with the following three edges: {(i,j), (j,k), (i,k)}. Then we can define the number of triangles that vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is involved in as &lt;math&gt;\delta (i)&lt;/math&gt; and, as each triangle is counted three times, we can express the number of triangles in G as &lt;math&gt;\delta (G) = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i\in V} \ \delta (i)&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that triadic closure holds, only two strong edges are required for a triple to form and the number of triples of vertex i is &lt;math&gt;\tau (i) = \binom{d_i}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming &lt;math&gt;d_i \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we can express &lt;math&gt;\tau (G) = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i\in V} \ \tau (i)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, for a vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d_i \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[clustering coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;c(i)&lt;/math&gt; of vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of triples for vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that are closed, and can be measured as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta (i)}{\tau (i)}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the [[clustering coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;C(G)&lt;/math&gt; of graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;C(G) = \frac {1}{N_2} \sum_{i \in V, d_i \ge 2} c(i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes with degree at least 2.

===Transitivity===
Another measure for the presence of triadic closure is transitivity, defined as &lt;math&gt;T(G) = \frac{3\delta (G)}{\tau (G)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Causes and effects==
In a trust network, triadic closure is likely to develop due to the transitive property. If a node A trusts node B, and node B trusts node C, node A will have the basis to trust node C. In a social network, strong triadic closure occurs because there is increased opportunity for nodes A and C with common neighbor B to meet and therefore create at least weak ties. Node B also has the incentive to bring A and C together to decrease the latent stress in two separate relationships.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

Networks that stay true to this principle become highly interconnected and have very high clustering coefficients. However, networks that do not follow this principle turn out to be poorly connected and may suffer from instability once negative relations are included.

Triadic closure is a good model for how networks will evolve over time. While simple graph theory tends to analyze networks at one point in time, applying the triadic closure principle can predict the development of ties within a network and show the progression of connectivity.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

In social networks, triadic closure facilitates cooperative behavior, but when new connections are made via
referrals from existing connections the average global fraction of cooperators is less than when individuals choose new connections randomly from the population at large. Two possible effects for this are by the structural and informational construction. The structural construction arises from the propensity toward high clusterability. The informational construction comes from the assumption that an individual knows something about a friend's friend, as opposed to a random stranger.

==Strong Triadic Closure Property and local bridges==
Strong Triadic Closure Property is that if a node has strong ties to two neighbors, then these neighbors must have at least a weak tie between them. A [[local bridge]] occurs, on the other hand, when a node is acting as a gatekeeper between two neighboring nodes who are not otherwise connected. In a network that follows the Strong Triadic Closure Property, one of the ties between nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a weak tie.

===Proof by contradiction===

Let node B be a local bridge between nodes A and C such that there is no weak tie between the nodes involved. Therefore, B has a strong tie to both A and C. By the definition of Strong Triadic Closure, a weak tie would develop between nodes A and C. However, this contradicts the fact that B is a local gatekeeper. Thus at least one of the nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a weak tie to prevent triadic closure from occurring.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

'''Unisex''' refers to things that are not [[sex-specific]], being suitable for either [[sex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/unisex?view=uk obkaqfAskOxford: unisex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/unisex unisex - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be another term for [[gender-blindness]].

The term was coined in the 1960s and was used fairly informally. Though the combining form ''uni-'' is from the Latin ''unus'' meaning ''one'', the term seems to have been influenced by words such as ''united'' and ''universal'' where the ''uni-'' prefix takes on the sense of ''shared''. In this sense, it can be seen as meaning ''shared by sexes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/unisex?view=uk AskOxford: Why does 'unisex' refer to something to do with various exes, not just one sex?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hair stylists and [[beauty salon]]s that serve both men and women are often referred to as unisex. This is also typical of other services and products that had traditionally been separated by sexes, such as clothing shops or beauty products. A facility that is usually [[sex segregated]] but is not so designated may be  referred to as unisex, such as a [[public toilet]]. [[Unisex clothing]] includes garments like T-shirts; versions of other garments may be tailored for the different fits depending on one's [[sex]], such as jeans. The sharing of a pool, beach or other water or recreational facility by swimmers and others of various sexes is commonly referred to as [[mixed bathing]]. 'Mates' was the first unisex store created by Irvine Sellar in England. When a school admits students of various sexes, it may be called coeducational or a [[mixed-sex education|mixed-sex school]].

A '''''Vorlage''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfoːɐ̯laːɡə|}}; from the [[German language|German]] for ''prototype'' or ''template'') is a prior version or manifestation of a text under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online: vorlage, n.
Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. &lt;[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679 http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679]&gt;; accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular [[manuscript]] of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Jonathan D. H., ''Contours in the Text'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a [[translation]] is called the ''Vorlage'' of that translation.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman &amp; Kuhlken, ''What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter?'' (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Luther Bible]] is a translation of the [[Textus Receptus]]. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the ''Vorlage'' of the Luther Bible.  

Sometimes the ''Vorlage'' of a translation may be lost to history.  In some of these cases the ''Vorlage'' may be reconstructed from the translation.  Such a reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may be called a ''retroversion'', and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, the ''Vorlage'' may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of [[textual criticism]].  This reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.  Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed ''Vorlage'' of the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] at parts to correct the Hebrew [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.&lt;ref&gt;Albrektson, B., "Masoretic or Mixed" in ''Text, Translation, Theology'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as another example, the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] fragments of Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] included among the [[Nag Hammadi library]] are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Slings, S. R., ''Platonis Rempublicam'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the bulk of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the ''Vorlage'' exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.&lt;ref&gt;Plisch, Uwe-Karsten ''Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar''. (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alliantiewapen Nassau Loon-Heinsberg - Alliance coat of arms of Nassau Loon-Heinsberg - Wapenboek Nassau-Vianden - KB 1900 A 016, folium 20r.jpg|thumb|Alliance arms of [[Maria of Loon-Heinsberg]]. Arms of women were usually depicted on lozenges. Here, her family arms are impaled with those of her husband, [[Jan IV of Nassau]]. ]]

Due to the differing role of women in past society, special rules grew relating to the [[blazon]]ing of arms for women. The rules for women and heraldry developed differently from place to place and there is no one single rule that applies everywhere. In general, arms of women were most likely depicted not on shields but on [[Lozenge_(heraldry)|lonzeges]] or ovals. Different rules exist that depend on the woman's marital status and a married woman would also often make use of her husband's arms in addition to those from her family. In both the English&lt;ref name="ukcollege1"/&gt; and the Scottish&lt;ref name="hersocscot"/&gt; systems of heraldry these differences remain active.

==Characteristics==
===Escutcheons, crests, and other heraldic elements===
Heraldry has its origins from associations with warfare and the age of chivalry. The traditional shield was also associated with war and so women did not usually display familial arms on [[Escutcheon_(heraldry)|escutcheons]]. Rather, they could display these on various other shapes: more commonly the [[Lozenge_(heraldry)|lozenge]], an oval, or a [[Cartouche_(design)|cartouche]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]–a device that sits atop the shield on an [[armorial achievement]]–likewise was not accorded to heraldic devices of women as these had associations with warfare.

===Transmission===
In many heraldic traditions, arms generally are passed patrilineally. In other nations, in Canadian heraldry for example,  women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers (if any). Women in Canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs, regardless of gender.{{refn|This system of equality for men and women is a result of provisions in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantee, among other things, freedom from discrimination under the law on the basis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterofrights.ca/en/17_00_01 |title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – Equality Rights |publisher=6074332 Canada Inc., in association with SailorJones Media Inc. |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[English heraldry|English]], [[Scottish Heraldry|Scottish]] and [[Northern Irish heraldry]], a [[woman]] may bear arms by inheritance from her father&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies1"&gt;{{ Citation | last=Fox-Davies | first=Arthur | lastauthoramp=yes | title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry | publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. | place= | volume= | edition= | year=2007 | quote=Every woman is entitled to bear upon a lozenge in her own lifetime the arms, quarterings, and difference marks which belonged to her father. | page=546 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSeEWjQCTIAC&amp;lpg=PA546&amp;dq=heraldic%20heiress&amp;pg=PA546#v=onepage&amp;q=heraldic%20heiress&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by grant to herself.  When unmarried, she displays her arms on a [[lozenge]] (a diamond shape) or on an oval or oval-like shape. Traditionally, a woman does not display her arms on a shield, as the shield originated with [[knights]] and warfare, and is thus viewed as fitting for a man, but not a woman.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
[[image: Coat of Arms of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.svg|thumb|left|The arms of the [[Duchess of Cambridge]] (right) impaled with those of her husband, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] (left)]] When married, a woman has the option of uniting her arms with those of her husband in what are called marital arms; their arms are [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]], meaning they are placed side by side in the same shield, with those of the man on the dexter (left, as seen from the front) and those of his wife on the sinister (right, as seen from the front).&lt;ref name="Boutell1"&gt;{{ Citation | last1=Beddoe | first1=Alan | last2=Galloway | first2=Strome  | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Beddoe's Canadian heraldry | publisher=Mika | place= | volume= | edition= | year=1981 | quote=If her husband is an armiger her arms leave the female lozenge and share her husband's shield, ie, are 'impaled' with his arms, his to the dexter (right) and hers to the sinister (left). | page=171 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QE5mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=armigerous+women+shield&amp;dq=armigerous+women+shield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1aDjT4-2C8Xe0QHD39jfCQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one spouse belongs to the higher ranks of an [[British honours system#Current orders of chivalry|order of chivalry]], and is thereby entitled to surround his or her arms with a circlet of the order, it is usual to depict them on two separate shields tilted towards one another, this is termed "accollé".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A married woman may also bear either her own arms or her husband's arms alone on a shield with the shield charged with a small lozenge to distinguish her from her husband.&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slater,  Stephen|title=The  Complete  Book  of  Heraldry|year=2004|publisher=Anness  Pub.  Co.|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widowed woman usually displays the impaled arms on a lozenge-shaped shield, unless she is a heraldic heiress (see below).&lt;ref name="Fearn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fearn, Jacqueline|title=Discovering Heraldry|year=1980|publisher=Shire|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heraldic Heiresses====
If the woman is an [[heraldic heiress]], her arms are shown on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon of pretence]], which is a small shield in the centre of her husband's arms. When widowed, instead of showing the impaled arms on a lozenge, she continues to use her marital arms, but placed on a lozenge or oval.&lt;ref name="Fearn"/&gt; In England and Northern Ireland, if there is more than one surviving daughter, each transmits her father's arms on equal terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFriar1993|Friar 1993]], p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland however, only the eldest surviving daughter transmits her father's undifferenced arms to her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBurnett1997|Burnett 1997]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Heraldry===
{{main|Canadian heraldry}}
 
In [[Canadian heraldry]], women and men are treated equally for heraldic purpose, reflecting Canadian equality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterofrights.ca/en/17_00_01 |title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - Equality Rights |publisher=6074332 Canada Inc., in association with SailorJones Media Inc. |date= |accessdate= June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore common to display the arms of women on shields, rather than on a lozenge or oval, but a woman may still choose to have her arms displayed on a traditional shape.

In many systems of heraldry, the arms of each living person must be unique. English heraldry has used armorial variants to distinguish the arms of brothers from their father's arms and from each other since the thirteenth century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Boutell |title=The handbook to English heraldry |others=[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ed |year=1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xdMAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Boutell%20Fox%20Davies&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Chapter XII}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is now normally done by the system of marks or ''brisures'' set up by the early Tudor herald [[John Writhe]].&lt;ref name="ukcollege1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/12.htm|title=The Law of Arms: The descent of arms|date=2004-04-10|publisher=College of Arms|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada adds a unique series of brisures for use by female children who inherit arms.

'''Women in law''' describes the role played by women in the [[law|legal profession]] and related occupations, which includes [[lawyer]]s (also called [[barrister]]s, [[advocate]]s, [[solicitor]]s, [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s or legal counselors), [[paralegal]]s, [[prosecutor]]s (also called [[District Attorney]]s or [[Crown Prosecutor]]s), [[judge]]s, legal scholars (including [[feminist legal theory|feminist legal theorists]]), law professors and [[law school]] deans.

In the US, while women made up 34% of the legal profession in 2014, women are underrepresented in senior positions in all areas of the profession. There has been an increase in women in the law field from the 1970s to 2010, but the increase has been seen in entry level jobs. In the United States, 60% of attorneys are women; however, the percent of female equity partners is 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinnington|first1=Ashly|title=Lawyers' Professional Careers: Increasing Women's Inclusion in the Partnership of Law Firms.|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|date=November 2013|volume= 20|issue= 6|pages=616–631|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=8624e30e-cc90-471e-9ad7-c6045354837b%40sessionmgr4007&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=90674460|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women of color]] are even more underrepresented in the legal profession.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/marketing/women/current_glance_statistics_july2014.authcheckdam.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Current Glance at Women in the Law |date=July 2014 |website=Americanbar.com|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In private practice law firms, women make up just 4% of managing partners in the 200 biggest law firms.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org"/&gt; In 2014 in [[Fortune 500]] corporations, 21% of the [[general counsel]]s were women, of which only 10.5% were African-American, 5.7% were Hispanic, 1.9% were Asian-American/Pacific Islanders, and 0% were Middle Eastern.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org"/&gt; In 2009, 21.6% of law school Deans were women.

==Representation and working conditions==
===United States===
{{Main|Women in the United States judiciary}}
The [[American Bar Association]] reported that in 2014, women made up 34% of the legal profession and men made up 66%.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; In private practice law firms, women make up 20.2% of partners, 17% of equity partners and 4% of managing partners in the 200 biggest law firms.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt;  At the junior level of the profession, women make up 44.8% of associates and 45.3% of summer associates.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; In 2014 in [[Fortune 500]] corporations, 21% of the [[general counsel]]s were women and 79% were men. Of these 21% of women general counsels, 81.9% were Caucasian, 10.5% were African-American, 5.7% were Hispanic, 1.9% were Asian-American/Pacific Islanders, and 0% were Middle Eastern.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; In 2009, women were 21.6% of law school Deans, 45.7% of Associate, Vice-Deans or Deputy Deans and 66.2% of Assistant Deans. Women have better representation on law school [[Law Review]]s. In the top 50 schools as ranked by ''US World and News Reports'' in 2012-2013, women made up 46% of leadership positions and 38% of editor-in-chief positions.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt;

In 2012, women held 27.1% of all federal and state judge positions, while men held 73.9%.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; In 2014, three of nine Supreme Court justices were women (33%), 33% of Circuit Court of Appeals judges and 24% of federal court judges.&lt;ref name="americanbar.org" /&gt; Women held 27% of all state judge positions.

During the 2012-2013 academic year, women made up 47% of [[Juris Doctor]] (JD) students, people of color made up 25.8% of JD students.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; In 2009 in the US, women made up 20.6% of law school deans.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; In the US in 2014, 32.9% of all lawyers were women.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; 44.8% of law firm associates were women in 2013.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; In the 50 "best law firms for women" in the US, "19% of the equity partners were women,

"Only 24.1% of all federal judgeships were held by women, and only 27.5% of state judgeships were held by women.:&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; Women lawyers' salaries were "83% of men lawyers’ salaries in 2014".&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt;

===Canada===
In 2010 in Canada, "there were 22,261 practicing women lawyers and 37,617 practicing men lawyers." &lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; Canadian studies show that "50% of lawyers said they felt their firms were doing "poorly" or "very poorly" in their provision of flexible work arrangements."&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; More women lawyers found it "difficult to manage the demands of work and personal/family life" than men, with 75% of women reporting these challenges versus 66% of men associates.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org" /&gt; A 2010 report about Ontario lawyers from 1971 to 2006 indicates that "...racialized women accounted for 16% of all lawyers under 30, compared to 5% of lawyers 30 and older in 2006.

== Women of color ==

=== Representation ===
The National Association for Law Placement (NALP) found that every year since 2009 there has been a decline of African-American associates—“from 4.66 percent to 3.95 percent."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Liane|date=March 2016|title=Minority Women Are Disappearing from BigLaw--And Here's Why.|url=|journal=ABA Journal|volume=|pages=|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a November 2015 NALP press release, at just 2.55 percent of partners, minority women remain the most underrepresented group at partnership level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Treatment ===
In a 2008 survey, by the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL), the report found that women of color view their workplace as racially/ethnically stereotypical and exclusionary as a result. Women of color also felt that law firms were not taking enough action to increase diversity and when actions were taken they were not executed effectively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=Women of Color Continue to Face Barriers in U.S. Law Firms, According to Catalyst Report.|url=|journal=Diversity Factor|volume=17|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The America Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession released a report which was a culmination of a study meant to address the decline of women of color in the legal profession. In the study, women of color were given the opportunity to express concern over the negative effects they faced in the workplace and how those effects carried into their personal life. Women of color reported feelings of exclusion, isolation, and as though they were receiving more unwanted critical attention than their counterparts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Paulette|date=January 2009|title=Issues and Solutions Affecting Women of Color in the Law.|url=|journal=Minority Trial Lawyer|volume=7|pages=|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession when looking at reports on the treatment of women of color in the legal profession were disappointed with the patterns they noticed which led the American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession to undertake their own research in 2003, the Women of Color Research Initiative. In both law firms and corporate legal departments the findings were that women of color “receive less compensation than men and white women; are denied equal access to significant assignments, mentoring and sponsorship opportunities; receive fewer promotions; and have the highest rate of attrition.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is a ripple effect within the treatment of women of color. Women of color are put at a disadvantage early on making “the ultimate result that women of color miss opportunities to get better work assignments, more client contact, and more billable hours.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women of color’s treatment within the legal profession and their feelings about this treatment have affected the retention of women of color in the legal profession. Women of color leave law firms at a high rate, “nearly 75 percent leave by their fifth year, and nearly 86 percent leave before their seventh year."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These women are leaving because they feel the only way to escape exclusion in the workplace is to leave the workplace.

=== Strategy ===
ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession released a report aimed at identifying challenges faced by women of color in law firms and found that “to overcome systemic discrimination against women of color, firms must recognize that the experiences of women of color are different from those of other groups; implementing changes to reflect this difference is necessary for retention. Firms and corporations must initiate active mentorship programs and encourage organization-wide discussions about issues concerning women of color, and constructive feedback is required.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  After the release of this report, several law firms have attempted the recommendations set forth by the report. Law firms began initiatives that focus on recruiting women of color as well as ensuring the retention of women of color as well. Recruiting of minority women has been increased through law firms finding summer associates by doing interviews “at the Southeast Minority Career Fair, MCCA/Vault Career Fair, Specialty Bar Association, Lavender Law Career Fair, and at schools such as Howard University School of Law and North Carolina Central School of Law.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Organizations==
===Center for Women in Law (US)===
The [[Center for Women in Law]] is a US organization set up and funded by women, says it is "devoted to the success of the entire spectrum of women in law ... serves as a national resource to convene leaders, generate ideas, and lead change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/law/centers/cwil/about-the-center/ |title=Center for Women in Law » About The Center |website=Utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It combines theory with practice, addressing issues facing individuals and the profession as a whole. The Center is a Vision 2020 National Ally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drexel.edu/vision2020/who/national-allies/Center%20for%20Women%20in%20Law/ Drexel University, College of Medicine, Vision 2020: national Allies - Center for Women in Law]. "Vision 2020 is a national coalition of organizations and individuals united in the commitment to achieve women’s economic and social equality. It was founded and administered by the Institute for Women's Health and Leadership at Drexel University College of Medicine."&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was founded in 2008 by a group of women, many of whom were alumnae of [[The University of Texas School of Law]], and many of whom graduated from law school in earlier decades when it was not common for women to pursue law as a career.  The group began discussing the issues faced by women lawyers and became determined to understand fully and address effectively the underlying causes of the barriers to advancement faced by women lawyers. The Austin Manifesto calls for specific, concrete steps to tackle the obstacles facing women in the legal profession today. The center holds summits and meetings on issues affecting women in the legal profession.

===National Women's Law Center (US)===
The [[National Women's Law Center]] (NWLC) is a [[United States]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1972 and based in Washington, D.C. The Center advocates for women's rights through litigation and policy initiatives. It began when female administrative staff and law students at the [[Center for Law and Social Policy]] demanded that their pay be improved, that the center hire female lawyers, that they no longer be expected to serve coffee, and that the center create a women's program.&lt;ref name="womensenews1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naili |first=Hajer |url=http://womensenews.org/story/21-leaders-the-21st-century/111229/21-leaders-2012-seven-who-leverage-power |title=21 Leaders 2012 - Seven Who Leverage Power |publisher=Women's eNews |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcia Greenberger]] was hired in 1972 to start the program and [[Nancy Duff Campbell]] joined her in 1978.&lt;ref name="womensenews1" /&gt; In 1981, the two decided to turn the program into the separate National Women's Law Center.&lt;ref name="womensenews1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwlc.org/profile/marcia-greenberger |title=Marcia D.

===Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (Canada)===
[[Women's Legal Education and Action Fund]], referred to by the [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] LEAF, is the "...only national organization in Canada that exists to ensure the equality rights of women and girls under the law.".&lt;ref name="LEAF.ca"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://leaf.ca/ | title=Women's Legal Education and Action Fund | publisher=Women's Legal Education and Action Fund | accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established on April 19, 1985, LEAF was formed in response to the enactment of [[Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] to ensure that there was fair and unbiased interpretation of women’s Charter rights by the courts. LEAF performs legal research and [[intervention (law)|intervenes]] in [[appeal|appellate]] and [[Supreme Court of Canada]] cases on women's issues . LEAF has been an intervener in many significant decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, particularly cases involving section 15 Charter challenges. In addition to its legal work, LEAF also organizes speaking engagements and projects that allow lawyers interested in women’s rights to educate one another, to educate the public, and to create collective responses to legal issues related to women’s equality. LEAF was created by founding mother [[Doris Anderson]] and other women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaf.ca/about-leaf/history/ |title=History of LEAF - Women's Legal Education and Action Fund |website=Leaf.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in Law and Litigation (India)===
[[Women in Law and Litigation]] (WILL) was formed in India in 2014 by women lawyers, judges and legal professionals to deal with [[gender discrimination]] faced by women in the field of law. The litigating public prefers to deal with male lawyers.&lt;ref name="ie"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women lawyers have to work more to prove themselves: SC Judge Desai|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/women-lawyers-have-to-work-more-to-prove-themselves-sc-judge-desai/|accessdate=6 September 2014|agency=Indian Express|date=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was formed under the supervision of [[Supreme Court of India]] and the justice of Supreme Court of India, [[Ranjana Desai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women have broken barriers of gender discrimination: SC judge|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/women-have-broken-barriers-of-gender-discrimination-sc-judge_1465598.html|accessdate=6 September 2014|agency=Zee News|date=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; WILL was formed to provide professional support, advocacy skills, and a platform for discussion on ways for development of women lawyers. 
Justice Hima Kohli of the High Court (Delhi) defined WILL as the society would be a "way to give back to the system for senior lawyers and legal practitioners who have "reached high positions".&lt;ref name="ie" /&gt;

==Feminist perspectives==
[[Feminist legal theory]], also known as feminist [[jurisprudence]], is based on the belief that the law has been fundamental in [[Patriarchy|women's historical subordination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fineman|first1=Martha A.|title=Feminist Legal Theory|journal=Journal of Gender, Social Policy and the Law|volume=13|issue=1|pages=13–32|url=http://www.iiav.nl/ezines/web/AmericanUniversityJournal/2005/No1/american/fineman.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project of feminist [[legal theory]] is twofold. First, feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law played a role in women's former subordinate status. Second, it is dedicated to changing women's status through a reworking of the law and its approach to [[gender]]. In 1984 [[Martha Fineman]] founded the [[Feminism and Legal Theory Project]] at the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] to explore the relationships between [[feminist theory]], practice, and law, which has been instrumental in the development of feminist legal theory.

The [[liberalism|liberal]] model of [[equality under the law]] operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights-based approach to law, though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice. The difference model emphasizes the significance of [[gender differences]] and holds that these differences should not be obscured by the law, but should be taken into account by it. The dominance model views the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance. Feminists from the [[postmodern]] camp have deconstructed the notions of objectivity and neutrality, claiming that every perspective is socially situated. See [[equality feminism]], [[difference feminism]], [[radical feminism]], and [[postmodern feminism]] for context.

Notable scholars include:
*[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]
*[[Catharine MacKinnon]]
*[[Martha Fineman]]
*[[Mari Matsuda]]

===Feminist philosophy of law===
Feminist [[philosophy of law]] "...identifies the pervasive influence of patriarchy on legal structures, demonstrates its effects on the material condition of women and girls, and develops reforms to correct gender injustice, exploitation, or restriction." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-law/ |title=Feminist Philosophy of Law (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist philosophy of law uses approaches drawn from "...[[feminist epistemology]], relational metaphysics, [[feminist political theory]], and other developments in [[feminist philosophy]] to understand how legal institutions enforce dominant masculinist norms."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; In the contemporary era, feminist philosophy of law also takes account of approaches such as "...[[human rights|human rights theory]], [[postcolonial theory]], critical legal studies, critical [[race theory]], [[queer theory]], and [[disability studies]]." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; As with feminism in general, there are many subtypes of feminist philosophy of law, including "...radical, socialist and Marxist, relational, cultural, postmodern, dominance, difference, pragmatist, and liberal approaches." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; Feminist philosophers of law argue that "... law makes [[systemic bias]] (as opposed to personal biases of particular individuals) invisible, normal, entrenched, and thus difficult to identify and to oppose." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; Feminist philosophers of law view laws as "...patriarchal, reflecting ancient and almost universal presumptions of [[gender inequality]]." &lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt; Some of the legal issues analyzed by feminist philosophers of law include [[marriage]], [[reproductive rights]] (e.g., pertaining to laws on [[abortion]]), the "commodification of the body" (as in [[sex work]]) and [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt;

== History ==
In the United Kingdom, the first woman to pass a law degree was [[Eliza Orme]], who graduated from [[University College London]] in 1888. She was not allowed to qualify to practice as either a solicitor or a barrister. It was not until 1919, with the passage of the [[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]] that women could enter the legal profession. This had been challenged in 1914 in a case known as ''Bebb v Law Society'', in which the Court of Appeal found that women did not fall within the legal definition of "persons" and so could not become lawyers. The 1919 Act also allowed women to serve on juries for the first time.

She wanted to do a law degree, but at that time, Western Reserve's law school did not admit women.  Allen attended the law school at the [[University of Chicago]] for a year, and then transferred to [[New York University]]. In 1913, she got her law degree, graduating with honors.  She became interested in politics, and more committed to the cause of women's [[suffrage]].  She began challenging local laws that limited women's participation in the political process. She argued one case that went all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court. In 1919, she was appointed the assistant prosecuting attorney for Cleveland's [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]]. By 1920, she was elected as a Common Pleas judge. In 1922, Allen was elected to the [[Ohio Supreme Court]]. She was appointed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] in 1934, making her one of the first women federal judges.

[[File:Clara Brett Martin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Canadian [[Clara Brett Martin]] became the first woman lawyer in the [[British Empire]] in 1897 after a lengthy dispute with the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]], which argued–unsuccessfully–that only men could become lawyers.]]  
At the end of the nineteenth century, Canadian women were barred from participation in, let alone any influence on or control over, the legal system–women could not become lawyers, magistrates, judges, jurors, voters or legislators. [[Clara Brett Martin]] (1874 &amp;ndash; 1923) became the first female lawyer in the British Empire in 1897 after a lengthy debate in which the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]] tried to prevent her from joining the legal profession. After graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1891, Martin submitted a petition to the Law Society to become a member. Her petition was rejected by the Society after contentious debate, with the Society ruling that only men could be admitted to the practice of law, because the Society's statute stated that only a "person" could become a lawyer. At that time, women were not considered to be "persons" in Canada, from a legal perspective. [[W.D. Balfour]] sponsored a bill that provided that the word "person" in the Law Society's statute should be interpreted to include females as well as males.  Martin’s cause was also supported by prominent women of the day including [[Emily Stowe]] and [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]]. With the support of the Premier, [[Oliver Mowat]], legislation was passed on April 13, 1892, which permitted the admission of women as solicitors.
