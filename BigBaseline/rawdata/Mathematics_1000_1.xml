{{italic title}}
'''''Analysis Situs''''' is a book by the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] mathematician [[Oswald Veblen]], published in 1922. It is based on his 1916 lectures at the Cambridge Colloquium of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. The book, which went into a second edition in 1931, was the first English-language [[textbook]] on [[topology]], and served for many years as the standard reference for the domain. Its contents were based on the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] as well as Veblen's own work with his former student and colleague, [[James Waddell Alexander II|James Alexander]].{{sfnp|Hodge|1961|p=508}}

Among the many innovations in the book was the first definition of a [[topological manifold]],{{sfnp|Scholz|1999|p=}} and systematisations of [[Betti number]], [[Whitehead torsion|torsion]], the [[fundamental group]], and the [[topological spaces|topological classification problem]].{{sfnp|Batterson|2007|p=608}}

[[Image:Hortus Deliciarum - Arithmetik.gif|thumb|[[Allegory]] of the Arithmetic with knotted rope (taken from the [[Hortus deliciarum]] (around 1180)]]
The '''arithmetic rope''', or '''knotted rope''', was a widely used [[arithmetic tool]] in the [[Middle Ages]] that could be used to solve many [[mathematical]] and [[geometry|geometrical]] problems.

An arithmetic rope generally has at least 13 knots—therefore, it is often called '''thirteen-knot-rope'''—placed at equal intervals. More knots were beneficial, especially for [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].

In [[medieval architecture]], the knotted rope was indispensable for architects, because it allowed the construction of [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] and [[right-angled triangle]]s, as well as [[circle]]s.

In the depiction of the [[liberal arts]] in [[Hortus deliciarum]], the [[allegory]] of arithmetics is a female figure with a knotted rope.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">In [[mathematics]], an '''axiom of countability''' is a property of certain [[mathematical object]]s (usually in a [[Category (mathematics)|category]]) that asserts the existence of a [[countable|countable set]] with certain properties. Without such an axiom, such a set might not provably exist.

==Important examples==
Important countability axioms for [[topological space]]s include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Modern General Topology|series=North-Holland Mathematical Library|first=J.-I.|last=Nagata|edition=3rd|publisher=Elsevier|year=1985|isbn=9780080933795|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecvd8dCAQp0C&amp;pg=PA104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[sequential space]]: a set is open if every [[sequence]] [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] to a [[point (geometry)|point]] in the set is eventually in the set
*[[first-countable space]]: every point has a countable [[neighbourhood system|neighbourhood basis]] (local  base)
*[[second-countable space]]: the topology has a countable [[base (topology)|base]]
*[[separable space]]: there exists a countable [[dense (topology)|dense]] subset
*[[Lindelöf space]]: every [[open cover]] has a countable [[subcover]]
*[[σ-compact space]]: there exists a countable cover by compact spaces

==Relationships with each other==
These axioms are related to each other in the following ways:
*Every first countable space is sequential.
*Every second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf.
*Every σ-compact space is Lindelöf.
*Every [[metric space]] is first countable.
*For metric spaces second-countability, separability, and the Lindelöf property are all equivalent.
 
==Related concepts==
Other examples of mathematical objects obeying axioms of countability include [[sigma-finite]] [[measure (mathematics)|measure space]]s, and [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s of [[countable type]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10156">In [[combinatorics]], '''double counting''', also called '''counting in two ways''', is a [[combinatorial proof]] technique for showing that two expressions are equal by demonstrating that they are two ways of counting the size of one [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. In this technique, which {{harvtxt|van Lint|Wilson|2001}} call “one of the most important tools in combinatorics,” one describes a finite set ''X'' from two perspectives leading to two distinct expressions for the size of the set. Since both expressions equal the size of the same set, they equal each other.

==Examples==

===Multiplication (of natural numbers) commutes===
This is a simple example of double counting, often used when teaching multiplication to young children. In this context, multiplication is introduced as repeated addition, and is then shown to be [[Commutative_property|commutative]] by counting,  in two different ways, a number of items arranged in a rectangular grid.  Suppose the grid has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rows and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; columns.  We first count the items by summing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rows of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; items each, then a second time by summing &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; columns of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items each, thus showing that, for these particular values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n \times m = m \times n&lt;/math&gt;.  While not a proof, it clearly shows that multiplication commutes, for any example (of a practical size) we choose.

===Forming committees===
One example of the double counting method counts the number of ways in which a committee can be formed from ''n'' people, allowing any number of the people (even zero of them) to be part of the committee. That is, one counts the number of subsets that an ''n''-element set may have. One method for forming a committee is to ask each person to choose whether or not to join it. Each person has two choices – yes or no – and these choices are independent of those of the other people. Therefore there are 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; ... &amp;times; 2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; possibilities. Alternatively, one may observe that the size of the committee must be some number between 0 and ''n''. For each possible size ''k'', the number of ways in which a committee of ''k'' people can be formed from ''n'' people is the [[binomial coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore the total number of possible committees is the sum of binomial coefficients over ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ... ''n''. Equating the two expressions gives the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n,&lt;/math&gt;
a special case of the [[binomial theorem]]. A similar double counting method can be used to prove the more general identity
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=d}^n {n\choose k}{k\choose d} = 2^{n-d}{n\choose d}&lt;/math&gt;
({{harvnb|Garbano|Malerba|Lewinter|2003}}; {{harvnb|Klavžar|2006}}).

===Handshaking lemma===
Another theorem that is commonly proven with a double counting argument states that every [[undirected graph]] contains an even number of vertices of odd [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]]. That is, the number of vertices that have an odd number of incident edges must be even. In more colloquial terms, in a party of people some of whom shake hands, an even number of people must have shaken an odd number of other people's hands; for this reason, the result is known as the [[handshaking lemma]]. 

To prove this by double counting, let ''d(v)'' be the degree of vertex ''v''. The number of vertex-edge incidences in the graph may be counted in two different ways: by summing the degrees of the vertices, or by counting two incidences for every edge. Therefore
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_v d(v) = 2e&lt;/math&gt;
where ''e'' is the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of the vertices is therefore an [[even number]], which could not happen if an odd number of the vertices had odd degree. This fact, with this proof, appears in the 1736 paper of [[Leonhard Euler]] on the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] that first began the study of [[graph theory]].

===Counting trees===
[[File:Cayley's formula 2-4.svg|thumb|240px|[[Cayley's formula]] implies that there is {{nowrap|1 {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;2 &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sup&gt;}} tree on two vertices, {{nowrap|3 {{=}} 3&lt;sup&gt;3 &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sup&gt;}} trees on three vertices, and {{nowrap|16 {{=}} 4&lt;sup&gt;4 &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sup&gt;}} trees on four vertices.]]
[[File:Graph.tree. Cayley's formula.png|thumb|Adding a directed edge to a rooted forest]]
What is the number ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of different [[tree (graph theory)|trees]] that can be formed from a set of ''n'' distinct vertices? [[Cayley's formula]] gives the answer {{nowrap|''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. {{harvtxt|Aigner|Ziegler|1998}} list four proofs of this fact; they write of the fourth, a double counting proof due to Jim Pitman, that it is “the most beautiful of them all.”

Pitman's proof counts in two different ways the number of different sequences of directed edges that can be added to an [[empty graph]] on ''n'' vertices to form from it a rooted tree. One way to form such a sequence is to start with one of the ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' possible unrooted trees, choose one of its ''n'' vertices as root, and choose one of the {{nowrap|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)!}} possible sequences in which to add its {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} (directed) edges. Therefore, the total number of sequences that can be formed in this way is {{nowrap|''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;n''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)! {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;n''!}}.

Another way to count these edge sequences is to consider adding the edges one by one to an empty graph, and to count the number of choices available at each step. If one has added a collection of {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;minus; ''k''}} edges already, so that the graph formed by these edges is a rooted forest with ''k'' trees, there are {{nowrap|''n''(''k'' &amp;minus; 1)}} choices for the next edge to add: its starting vertex can be any one of the ''n'' vertices of the graph, and its ending vertex can be any one of the {{nowrap|''k'' &amp;minus; 1}} roots other than the root of the tree containing the starting vertex. Therefore, if one multiplies together the number of choices from the first step, the second step, etc., the total number of choices is
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{k=2}^{n} n(k-1) = n^{n-1} (n-1)! = n^{n-2} n!.&lt;/math&gt;
Equating these two formulas for the number of edge sequences results in Cayley's formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle T_n n!=n^{n-2}n!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle T_n=n^{n-2}.&lt;/math&gt;
As Aigner and Ziegler describe, the formula and the proof can be generalized to count the number of rooted forests with ''k'' trees, for any ''k''.

These may be grouped into sets of ''p'' words that can be transformed into each other by [[circular shift]]s; these sets are called [[necklace (combinatorics)|necklaces]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">In mathematics, '''Fraïssé's theorem''', named after [[Roland Fraïssé]], states that a [[class (set theory)|class]] ''K'' of finite [[relational structure]]s is the [[age (model theory)|age]] of a [[countable set|countable]] homogeneous relational structure if and only if it satisfies the following four conditions:

* ''K'' is closed under [[isomorphism]];
* ''K'' is closed under taking induced substructures;
* ''K'' has only countably many members up to isomorphism;
* ''K'' has the [[amalgamation property]].

If these conditions hold, then the countable homogeneous structure whose age is ''K'' is unique up to isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Meenaxi Bhattacharjee |author2=Dugald Macpherson |author3=Rögnvaldur G.

Fraïssé proved the theorem in the 1950s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7319">'''Ganita-yukti-bhasa''' (also written as '''Ganita Yuktibhasa''') is either the title or a part of the title of three different books:

The book is published in two volumes as Volume I and Volume II. Jyeshthadeva's Yuktibhasa discusses various topics in mathematics and astronomy and it is purported to be an enunciation of the rationales underlying the various mathematical assertions and the astronomical concepts and computations in the great treatise [[Tantrasamgraha]] of [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544). (An edition of the mathematical portion of [[Yuktibhasa]] with some explanatory notes in [[Malayalam]] had appeared in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Yuktibhâsâ, Part I'' (ed) with notes by Ramavarma (Maru) Thampuran and A. R. Akhileswara Aiyer, Magalodayam Ltd., [[Trichur]], [[Kerala]],  1123 [[Malayalam Era]], 1948 [[BCE|CE]].&lt;/ref&gt;)
*In addition to Jyshthadeva's Yuktibhasa, [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] had produced another work called '''Ganita Yuktibhasa'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=K.V. Sarma|author2=S.

The date of composition and the name of the author of this work in [[Sanskrit]] have not been determined with certainty. The book appears to be of a later period and seems to have been  composed as a somewhat rough Sanskrit translation of the Malayalam original [[Yuktibhasa]].
*'''Ganita Yuktibhasa (Volume III)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=K.V. Sarma|title=Ganita Yuktibhasa (Volume III)|publisher=[[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]]|location=[[Shimla]]|isbn=81-7986-052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is  the title of a book published by [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]] (IIAS), [[Shimla]],  and it is a critical edition of the [[Sanskrit]] Ganita Yuktibhasa.&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's ([[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]]) [[web page]] on the book:{{cite web|url=http://www.iias.org/p_ganita_yuktibhasa_volume-III.html|title=Ganita Yuktibhasa by K.V.

==More on ''Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva''==

This edition of [[Yuktibhasa]] has been divided into two volumes, even though the original [[Malayalam]] text has no such division. Volume I deals with  mathematics and Volume II treats astronomy. Each volume is divided into three parts: First part is an [[English language|English]] translation of the relevant [[Malayalam]] part of [[Yuktibhasa]], second part contains  detailed explanatory notes on the translation,  and in the third part the text in the [[Malayalam]] original is reproduced. The [[English language|English]] translation is by [[K.V. Sarma]] and the explanatory notes are provided by Ramasubramanian, K., Srinivas, M.D. and Sriram, M.S..

Volume I dealing with mathematics is divided into seven chapters. The topics discussed are the eight mathematical operations, a certain set of ten problems, arithmetic of fractions, rule of three, [[Kuṭṭaka|Kuttakara]] (linear indeterminate equations), infinite series and approximations for the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle and infinite series and approximations for sines.&lt;ref name="Kinokuniya DataBase"&gt;For more details on contents see Kinokuniya DataBase: {{cite web|url=http://bookwebpro.kinokuniya.co.jp/booksea.cgi?ISBN=1848820720http://www.buscalibros.cl/libro.php?libro=2104208|title=Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume II dealing with astronomy is divided into eight chapters. The topics covered are computation of mean and true longitudes of planets, Earth and celestial spheres, fifteen problems relating to ascension, declination, longitude, etc.,  determination of time, place, direction, etc., from gnomonic shadow, eclipses, Vyatipata (when the sun and moon have the same declination), visibility correction for planets  and phases of the moon.&lt;ref name="Kinokuniya DataBase"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33463">'''Graduate Texts in Mathematics''' ('''GTM''') (ISSN 0072-5285) is a series of [[graduate school|graduate-level]] [[textbooks]] in [[mathematics]] published by [[Springer-Verlag]].  The books in this series, like the other Springer-Verlag mathematics series, are yellow books of a standard size (with variable numbers of pages).  The GTM series is easily identified by a white band at the top of the book.

The books in this series tend to be written at a more advanced level than the similar [[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] series, although there is a fair amount of overlap between the two series in terms of material covered and difficulty level.

'''''Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences''''' is a 1988 book by [[mathematician]] [[John Allen Paulos]] about "[[numeracy|innumeracy]]," a term he embraced to describe the mathematical equivalent of [[illiteracy]]: incompetence with numbers rather than words. Innumeracy is a problem with many otherwise educated and knowledgeable people. While many people would be ashamed to admit they are illiterate, there is very little shame in saying "I'm a people person, not a numbers person." Or "I always hated math".&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Elizabeth|title=Why do Americans Stink in Math?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/magazine/why-do-americans-stink-at-math.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=2014-07-14|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cundiff|first1=Elizabeth|title=Innumeracy|url=http://scholarsmine.mst.edu/peer2peer/vol1/iss1/5/|website=Missouri University of Science and Technology Scholars' Mine|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sketch guy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Carl|title=Americans are Bad at Math|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/your-money/americans-are-bad-at-math-but-its-not-too-late-to-fix.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=0|date=2014-08-04|website=New York Times|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos speaks mainly of the common misconceptions in regard to numbers. He looks at real-world examples in stock scams, psychics, astrology, sports records, elections, sex discrimination, UFOs, insurance and law, lotteries and drug testing.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt; Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more [[quantitative property|quantitative]] way. The book sheds light on the link between innumeracy and pseudoscience. For example, the fortune telling psychic's few correct and general observations are remembered over the many incorrect guesses. He also stresses the problem between the actual number of occurrences of various risks and popular perceptions of those risks happening.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt; The problems of innumeracy come at a great cost to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gina Donaldson, Jenny Field, Dave Harries, Clare, Tope, Helen Taylor|title=Becoming a Primary Mathematics Specialist Teacher|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHkJMtgVNp0C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=costs+of+innumeracy+to+society&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X0BkMeVj9g&amp;sig=I1sCzWCDZnUkhf0xoyhxInZvMxs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijgeaa4u7OAhVDxCYKHR2wAkwQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=costs%20of%20innumeracy%20to%20society&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics include [[probability]] and [[coincidence]], innumeracy in [[pseudoscience]], [[statistics]] and trade-offs in society. For example, the danger of getting killed in a car accident is much greater than terrorism and this danger should be reflected in how we allocate our limited resources.

==Background==

[[John Allen Paulos]] (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of mathematics at Temple University in Pennsylvania.  He is a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of mathematical literacy. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical innumeracy; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability and logic. He has received awards in:
2013 JPBM ([[Joint Policy Board for Mathematics]]) Award for Communicating Mathematics on a Sustained Basis to Large Audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Award for Communicating Mathematics|url=http://math.mit.edu/mathcomm/archives/john-allen-paulos-to-receive-math-communications-award/|publisher=JPBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2003 AAAS ([[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]) Award for Promoting the Public Understanding of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAAS|url=http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/public/public2003.shtml|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reasons for writing the book he states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Innumeracy, an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance, plagues far too many otherwise knowledgeable citizens. The same people who cringe when words such as “imply” and “infer” are confused react without a trace of embarrassment to even the most egregious of numerical solecisms. I remember once listening to someone at a party drone on about the difference between “continually” and “continuously.” Later that evening we were watching the news, and the TV weathercaster announced that there was a 50 percent chance of rain for Saturday and a 50 percent chance for Sunday, and concluded that there was therefore a 100 percent chance of rain that weekend. The remark went right by the self-styled grammarian, and even after I explained the mistake to him, he wasn’t nearly as indignant as he would have been had the weathercaster left a dangling participle.&lt;ref name="Innumeracy-book" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chapters==
# Examples and Principles. This chapter goes over how peoples lack of clarity of very large numbers lead to misconceptions. He argues for [[scientific notation]] being a clearer way to work with larger numbers. The ability to put numbers large and small in the correct context is key to understanding them in an intelligent way. He gives examples in some jokes, [[Rubik's cube]], nuclear weapons, travel at the speed of light, the number of 3 scoop combinations at Baskin-Robbins, dice rolls, the chance of getting AIDS and the chance of breathing the same molecule of breath as Julius Caesar.
# Probability and Coincidence. Underestimates of the frequency of coincidences is an example of innumeracy. People underestimate that an unlikely event is likely, given a large population sample. He gives examples in stock market newsletter scams, choosing a spouse, [[coincidence]] and the law, [[coin toss]] and the [[Hot-hand fallacy]] in sports.
# Pseudoscience. Here the author takes on how non-falsifiable statements play in with pseudoscience. For example ''Whatever God wills happens''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; can not be proven false so is not part of science. He touches examples in [[Freud]], [[Marx]], [[parapsychology]], dream prediction, [[astrology]], [[UFO's]], fraudulent medical treatments, [[Conditional probability]], [[blackjack]], drug testing and [[numerology]].
# What is Innumeracy? Here the author critiques public math education, the need for estimation in the math curriculum, math and humor(Paulos suggests that mathematicians have a particular sense of humor),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulos|first1=John Allen|title=Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0-8090-7447-8|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; innumeracy and the tendency to personalize excessively versus a statistical analysis, selective filtering of data to draw incorrect conclusions, decisions and framing of questions, various misconceptions about math being cold, impersonal or constraining and public safety risks.
# Statistics, Trade-Offs, and Society. This chapter addresses trade-offs in public policy, the [[prisoners dilemma]], [[type I and type II errors]] in statistics, when a true [[hypothesis]] is thought to be untrue or when a false hypothesis is thought to be true. Polling [[confidence interval]] is addressed, along with the [[law of large numbers]], [[Correlation does not imply causation]] and other statistical mistakes.

==Analysis==

''Innumeracy'' made the New York Times best seller the year it came out in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Communications Award|url=http://www.ams.org/images/JPBM-CA-citation-samples.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2016|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the New York Times best seller for 18 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPBM Communications Award|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201305/rnoti-p610.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a slightly revised addition in 2001.&lt;ref name="Complete-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/maths/paulosja.htm|title=Innumeracy|website=Complete Review|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received favorable reviews in the New York Times "He takes us a couple of steps closer to numeracy, and it is all in all an enlightening place to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lehmann-Haupt|first1=Christopher|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/23/books/books-of-the-times-dangers-of-being-a-nation-of-number-numbskulls.html|website=New York Times|date=1989-01-23|title=Innumeracy|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Tribune wrote "Despite the title, which suggests yet another learned report documenting the sorry state of America's educational system, what Paulos provides is a readable romp across a varied mathematical landscape.
It serves as an excellent antidote to tedious classroom lectures on the difference between inverse and direct proportions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vann|first1=John|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-03-05/business/8903240201_1_mathematics-innumeracy-trillion|website=Chicago Tribune|date=1989-03-05|title=Innumeracy|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LA Times review noted ""Paulos is very good at explaining all of this, though sometimes with a hectoring, bitter tone, for which he apologizes at the very end."&lt;ref name="Complete-review" /&gt; The Christian Science Monitor review said "Should you read ''Innumeracy'' if you enjoy reading math problems and reasoning them out? Yes, it's fun. Should you read it if you think you hate math and are turned off by math problems? Yes, you may even get turned on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wales|first1=R. Langdon|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1989/0214/dbnum.html|website=Christian Science Monitor|date=1989-02-14|title=Innumeracy|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">The '''Krieger–Nelson Prize''' is presented by the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] in recognition of an outstanding woman in mathematics. It was first
awarded in 1995. The award is named after [[Cecilia Krieger]] and [[Evelyn Nelson (mathematician)|Evelyn Nelson]], both known for their contributions to [[mathematics]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="cmsAward"&gt;[http://www.cms.math.ca/Prizes/info/kn.html Krieger–Nelson Prize], [[Canadian Mathematical Society]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipients==
While the award has largely been awarded to a female mathematician working at a [[List of universities in Canada|Canadian University]], it has also been awarded to [[Canada|Canadian]]-born or -educated women working outside of the country. For example, [[Cathleen Synge Morawetz|Cathleen Morawetz]], past president of the [[American Mathematical Society]], and a faculty member at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] (a division of [[New York University]]) was awarded the Krieger–Nelson Prize in 1997. (Morawetz was educated at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]). According to the call for applications, the award winner should be a "member of the Canadian mathematical community".&lt;ref name="cmsCall"&gt;[http://www.math.ca/Prizes/kn-nom.html Call for Applications Krieger–Nelson Prize Lectureship], [[Canadian Mathematical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The recipient of the Krieger–Nelson Prize delivers a lecture to the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]], typically during its summer meeting.&lt;ref name="cmsCall" /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''limiting case''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a [[special case]] that arises when one or more components of the object take on their most extreme possible values. For example:

* In [[statistics]], the limiting case of the [[binomial distribution]] is the [[Poisson distribution]]. As the number of events tends to infinity in the binomial distribution, the random variable changes from the binomial to the Poisson distribution.
*A [[Circle#Circle as limiting case of other figures|circle is a limiting case]] of various other figures, including the [[Cartesian oval]], the [[ellipse]], the [[superellipse]], and the [[Cassini oval]]. Each type of figure is a circle for certain values of the defining parameters, and the generic figure appears more and more like a circle as the limiting values are approached.
*[[Archimedes]] calculated an approximate value of [[π]] by treating the circle as the limiting case of a [[regular polygon]] with 3 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sides, as ''n'' gets large.
*In [[electricity and magnetism]], the [[long wavelength limit]] is the limiting case when the [[wavelength]] is much larger than the system size.
*In [[economics]], two limiting cases of a [[demand curve]] or [[supply curve]] are those in which the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is zero (the totally inelastic case) or infinity (the infinitely elastic case).
*In [[finance]], [[continuous compounding]] is the limiting case of compound interest in which the compounding period becomes infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as the number of compounding periods per year goes to infinity.

A limiting case is sometimes a [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate case]] in which some qualitative properties differ from the corresponding [[Generic property|properties of the generic case]]. For example:

*A [[Point (geometry)|point]] is a degenerate [[circle]], namely one with [[radius]] 0.
*A [[parabola]] can degenerate into two distinct or coinciding [[parallel lines]].
*An [[ellipse]] can degenerate into a single point or a [[line segment]].
*A [[hyperbola]] can degenerate into two [[intersecting lines]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26286">The following is a list of [[integral]]s ([[antiderivative]] functions) of [[rational function]]s. 
Any rational function can be integrated by [[partial fraction decomposition]] of the function into a sum of functions of the form:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{(x-b)^n}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{ax + b}{\left((x-c)^2+d^2\right)^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
which can then be integrated term by term.

For other types of functions, see [[lists of integrals]].
&lt;!--CAUTION: before 'correcting' one of these integrals, please check that the amended integral doesn't simply differ from the existing version by a constant term. NOTE: a constant *factor* in the argument of ln() may amount to a constant term in the integral. --&gt;

== Miscellaneous integrands ==

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \, dx= \ln\left|f(x)\right| + C&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x^2+a^2} \, dx = \frac{1}{a}\arctan\frac{x}{a}\,\! + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x^2-a^2} \, dx = \begin{cases} \displaystyle -\frac{1}{a}\,\operatorname{arctanh}\frac{x}{a} + C = \frac{1}{2a}\ln\frac{a-x}{a+x} + C  &amp; \text{(for }|x| &lt; |a|\mbox{)} \\[12pt] \displaystyle -\frac{1}{a}\,\operatorname{arccoth}\frac{x}{a} + C = \frac{1}{2a}\ln\frac{x-a}{x+a} + C &amp; \text{(for }|x| &gt; |a| \mbox{)} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \frac{dx}{x^{2^n} + 1} &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} \left\{ \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \left [ \sin \left(\frac{(2k -1) \pi}{2^n}\right) \arctan\left[\left(x - \cos \left(\frac{(2k -1) \pi}{2^n} \right) \right ) \csc \left(\frac{(2k -1) \pi}{2^n} \right) \right] \right] \right. \\
&amp;\qquad\qquad \left. - \frac{1}{2^n} \left [ \cos \left(\frac{(2k -1) \pi}{2^n} \right) \ln \left | x^2 - 2 x \cos \left(\frac{(2k -1) \pi}{2^n} \right) + 1 \right |  \right ] \right \} + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Integrands of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''a x'' + ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ==

Many of the following antiderivatives have a term of the form ln |''ax'' + ''b''|.  Because this is undefined when ''x'' = −''b'' / ''a'', the most general form of the antiderivative replaces the [[constant of integration]] with a [[locally constant function]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/03/reader_survey_logx_c.html Reader Survey: log|''x''| + ''C'']", Tom Leinster, ''The ''n''-category Café'', March 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is conventional to omit this from the notation.  For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{ax + b} \, dx= \begin{cases}
\dfrac{1}{a}\ln(-(ax + b)) + C^- &amp; ax+b&lt;0 \\
\dfrac{1}{a}\ln(ax + b) + C^+ &amp; ax+b&gt;0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is usually abbreviated as
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{ax + b} \, dx= \frac{1}{a}\ln\left|ax + b\right| + C,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is to be understood as notation for a locally constant function of ''x''.  This convention will be adhered to in the following.

:&lt;math&gt;\int (ax + b)^n \, dx= \frac{(ax + b)^{n+1}}{a(n + 1)} + C \qquad\text{(for } n\neq -1\mbox{)}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]])
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{x}{ax + b} \, dx= \frac{x}{a} - \frac{b}{a^2}\ln\left|ax + b\right| + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{x}{(ax + b)^2} \, dx= \frac{b}{a^2(ax + b)} + \frac{1}{a^2}\ln\left|ax + b\right| + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{x}{(ax + b)^n} \, dx= \frac{a(1 - n)x - b}{a^2(n - 1)(n - 2)(ax + b)^{n-1}} + C \qquad\text{(for } n\not\in \{1, 2\}\mbox{)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int x(ax + b)^n \, dx= \frac{a(n + 1)x - b}{a^2(n + 1)(n + 2)} (ax + b)^{n+1} + C \qquad\text{(for }n \not\in \{-1, -2\}\mbox{)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{x^2}{ax + b} \, dx= \frac{b^2\ln(\left|ax + b\right|)}{a^3}+\frac{ax^2 - 2bx}{2a^2} + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{x^2}{(ax + b)^2} \, dx= \frac{1}{a^3}\left(ax - 2b\ln\left|ax + b\right| - \frac{b^2}{ax + b}\right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{x^2}{(ax + b)^3} \, dx= \frac{1}{a^3}\left(\ln\left|ax + b\right| + \frac{2b}{ax + b} - \frac{b^2}{2(ax + b)^2}\right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{x^2}{(ax + b)^n} \, dx= \frac{1}{a^3}\left(-\frac{(ax + b)^{3-n}}{(n-3)} + \frac{2b (ax + b)^{2-n}}{(n-2)} - \frac{b^2 (ax + b)^{1-n}}{(n - 1)}\right) + C \qquad\text{(for } n\not\in \{1, 2, 3\}\mbox{)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x(ax + b)} \, dx = -\frac{1}{b}\ln\left|\frac{ax+b}{x}\right| + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x^2(ax+b)} \, dx = -\frac{1}{bx} + \frac{a}{b^2}\ln\left|\frac{ax+b}{x}\right| + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x^2(ax+b)^2} \, dx = -a\left(\frac{1}{b^2(ax+b)} + \frac{1}{ab^2x} - \frac{2}{b^3}\ln\left|\frac{ax+b}{x}\right|\right) + C&lt;/math&gt;

[[Latin letters|Latin]] and [[Greek letters]] are used in [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[engineering]], and other areas where mathematical notation is used as symbols for [[Mathematical constant|constant]]s, [[special function]]s, and also conventionally for [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing certain quantities. 

:Some common conventions:
* [[intensive quantity|Intensive quantities]] in [[physics]] are usually denoted with [[Lower case|minuscules]]&lt;br /&gt;while [[extensive quantity|extensive]] are denoted with [[capital letter]]s.
* Most symbols are written in [[Italic type|italic]]s.
* [[vector (geometry)|Vector]]s can be denoted in [[boldface]]. 
* Sets of [[number]]s are typically bold or [[blackboard bold]].

{{Calculus |Integral}}

[[Integral|Integration]] is the basic operation in [[integral calculus]].  While [[derivative|differentiation]] has [[Differentiation rules|easy rules]] by which the derivative of a complicated [[Function (mathematics)|function]] can be found by differentiating its simpler component functions, integration does not, so tables of known integrals are often useful. This page lists some of the most common [[antiderivative]]s.

==Historical development of integrals==
A compilation of a list of integrals (Integraltafeln) and techniques of integral calculus was published by the German mathematician {{Interlanguage link multi|Meier Hirsch|de}} (aka {{Interlanguage link multi|Meyer Hirsch|de}}) in 1810. These tables were republished in the United Kingdom in 1823. More extensive tables were compiled in 1858 by the Dutch mathematician [[David Bierens de Haan]] for his ''[[Tables d'intégrales définies]]'', supplemented by ''[[Supplément aux tables d'intégrales définies]]'' in ca. 1864&lt;!-- no visible date indication by itself. Google books entry states 1864, foreword states 1861, English WP article formely stated 1862 --&gt;. A new edition was published in 1867 under the title ''[[Nouvelles tables d'intégrales définies]]''. These tables, which contain mainly integrals of elementary functions, remained in use until the middle of the 20th century. They were then replaced by the much more extensive tables of [[Gradshteyn and Ryzhik]]. In Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, integrals originating from the book by Bierens de Haan are denoted by BI.

Not all [[closed-form expression]]s have closed-form antiderivatives; this study forms the subject of [[differential Galois theory]], which was initially developed by [[Joseph Liouville]] in the 1830s and 1840s, leading to [[Liouville's theorem (differential algebra)|Liouville's theorem]] which classifies which expressions have closed form antiderivatives. A simple example of a function without a closed form antiderivative is {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}, whose antiderivative is (up to constants) the [[error function]].

Since 1968 there is the [[Risch algorithm]] for determining indefinite integrals that can be expressed in term of [[elementary function]]s, typically using a [[computer algebra system]]. Integrals that cannot be expressed using elementary functions can be manipulated symbolically using general functions such as the [[Meijer G-function]].

==Lists of integrals==
More detail may be found on the following pages for the '''lists of [[integral]]s''':

* [[List of integrals of rational functions]]
* [[List of integrals of irrational functions]]
* [[List of integrals of trigonometric functions]]
* [[List of integrals of inverse trigonometric functions]]
* [[List of integrals of hyperbolic functions]]
* [[List of integrals of inverse hyperbolic functions]]
* [[List of integrals of exponential functions]]
* [[List of integrals of logarithmic functions]]
* [[List of integrals of Gaussian functions]]

{{anchor|Prudnikov-Brychkov-Marichev}}[[Izrail Solomonovich Gradshteyn|Gradshteyn]], [[Iosif Moiseevich Ryzhik|Ryzhik]], [[Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus|Geronimus]], [[Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin|Tseytlin]], Jeffrey, Zwillinger, Moll's (GR) ''[[Table of Integrals, Series, and Products]]'' contains a large collection of results. An even larger, multivolume table is the ''Integrals and Series'' by [[Anatoli Prudnikov|Prudnikov]], Brychkov, and [[Oleg Igorevich Marichev|Marichev]] (with volumes 1–3 listing integrals and series of [[elementary function|elementary]] and [[special functions]], volume 4–5 are tables of [[Laplace transform]]s). More compact collections can be found in e.g. Brychkov, Marichev, Prudnikov's ''Tables of Indefinite Integrals'', or as chapters in Zwillinger's ''CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae'' or [[Bronshtein and Semendyayev]]'s ''[[A Guide Book to Mathematics|Guide Book to Mathematics]]'', ''[[Handbook of Mathematics]]'' or ''[[Oxford Users' Guide to Mathematics|Users' Guide to Mathematics]]'', and other mathematical handbooks.

Other useful resources include [[Abramowitz and Stegun]] and the [[Bateman Manuscript Project]]. Both works contain many identities concerning specific integrals, which are organized with the most relevant topic instead of being collected into a separate table. Two volumes of the Bateman Manuscript are specific to integral transforms.

There are several web sites which have tables of integrals and integrals on demand. [[Wolfram Alpha]] can show results, and for some simpler expressions, also the intermediate steps of the integration. [[Wolfram Research]] also operates another online service, the [http://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator/ Wolfram Mathematica Online Integrator].

==Integrals of simple functions==
''C'' is used for an [[arbitrary constant of integration]] that can only be determined if something about the value of the integral at some point is known. Thus each function has an infinite number of [[Antiderivative|antiderivatives]].

These formulas only state in another form the assertions in the [[table of derivatives]].

===Integrals with a singularity===
When there is a [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularity]] in the function being integrated such that the antiderivative becomes undefined or at some point (the singularity), then ''C'' does not need to be the same on both sides of the singularity. The forms below normally assume the [[Cauchy principal value]] around a singularity in the value of ''C'' but this is not in general necessary. For instance in

:&lt;math&gt;\int {1 \over x}\,dx = \ln \left|x \right| + C&lt;/math&gt;

there is a singularity at 0 and the [[antiderivative]] becomes infinite there. If the integral above were to be used to compute a definite integral between −1 and 1, one would get the wrong answer 0. This however is the Cauchy principal value of the integral around the singularity. If the integration is done in the complex plane the result depends on the path around the origin, in this case the singularity contributes −''i''{{pi}} when using a path above the origin and ''i''{{pi}} for a path below the origin. A function on the real line could use a completely different value of ''C'' on either side of the origin as in:
: &lt;math&gt; \int {1 \over x}\,dx = \ln|x| + \begin{cases} A &amp; \text{if }x&gt;0; \\ B &amp; \text{if }x &lt; 0. \end{cases}  &lt;/math&gt;

===Rational functions===
:''More integrals: [[List of integrals of rational functions]]''

:&lt;math&gt;\int a\,dx = ax + C&lt;/math&gt;

The following function has a non-integrable singularity at 0 for {{math|''a'' ≤ −1}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^a\,dx = \frac{x^{a+1}}{a+1} + C \qquad\text{(for } a\neq -1\text{)}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]])
:&lt;math&gt;\int (ax + b)^n \, dx= \frac{(ax + b)^{n+1}}{a(n + 1)} + C \qquad\text{(for } n\neq -1\text{)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int {1 \over x}\,dx = \ln \left|x \right| + C&lt;/math&gt;
::More generally,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/03/reader_survey_logx_c.html Reader Survey: log|''x''| + ''C'']", Tom Leinster, ''The ''n''-category Café'', March 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\int {1 \over x}\,dx = \begin{cases}\ln \left|x \right| + C^- &amp; x &lt; 0\\
\ln \left|x \right| + C^+ &amp; x &gt; 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{c}{ax + b} \, dx= \frac{c}{a}\ln\left|ax + b\right| + C&lt;/math&gt;

===Exponential functions===
:''More integrals: [[List of integrals of exponential functions]]''

:&lt;math&gt;\int a^x\,dx = \frac{a^x}{\ln a} + C&lt;/math&gt;

===Logarithms===
:''More integrals: [[List of integrals of logarithmic functions]]''
:&lt;math&gt;\int \ln x\,dx = x \ln x - x + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \log_a x\,dx = x\log_a x - \frac{x}{\ln a} + C&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \csc{x} \, \cot{x} \, dx = -\csc{x} + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin^2 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\left(x - \frac{\sin 2x}{2} \right) + C = \frac{1}{2}(x - \sin x\cos x ) + C &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \cos^2 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\left(x + \frac{\sin 2x}{2} \right) + C = \frac{1}{2}(x + \sin x\cos x ) + C &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sec^3 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\sec x \tan x + \frac{1}{2}\ln|\sec x + \tan x| + C&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverse hyperbolic functions===

===Products of functions proportional to their second derivatives===
:&lt;math&gt;\int \cos ax\, e^{bx}\, dx = \frac{e^{bx}}{a^2+b^2}\left( a\sin ax + b\cos ax \right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin ax\, e^{bx}\, dx = \frac{e^{bx}}{a^2+b^2}\left( b\sin ax - a\cos ax \right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \cos ax\, \cosh bx\, dx = \frac{1}{a^2+b^2}\left( a\sin ax\, \cosh bx+ b\cos ax\, \sinh bx \right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin ax\, \cosh bx\, dx = \frac{1}{a^2+b^2}\left( b\sin ax\, \sinh bx- a\cos ax\, \cosh bx \right) + C&lt;/math&gt;

===Absolute-value functions===
Let {{math|''f''}} be a function which has at most one root on each interval on which it is defined, and {{math|''g''}} an antiderivative of {{math|''f''}} that is zero at each root of {{math|''f''}} (such an antiderivative exists if and only if the condition on {{math|''f''}} is satisfied), then
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| f(x)\right|\,dx = \sgn(f(x))g(x)+C,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|sgn(''x'')}} is the [[sign function]], which takes the values −1, 0, 1 when {{math|''x''}} is respectively negative, zero or positive. This gives the following formulas (where {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| (ax + b)^n \right|\,dx = \sgn(ax + b) {(ax + b)^{n+1} \over a(n+1)} + C \quad [\,n\text{ is odd, and } n \neq -1\,] \,.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \tan{ax} \right|\,dx = -\frac{1}{a}\sgn(\tan{ax}) \ln(\left|\cos{ax}\right|) + C&lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;ax \in \left( n\pi - \frac{\pi}{2}, n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt; for some integer {{math|''n''}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \csc{ax} \right|\,dx = -\frac{1}{a}\sgn(\csc{ax}) \ln(\left| \csc{ax} + \cot{ax} \right|) + C &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;ax \in \left( n\pi, n\pi + \pi \right) &lt;/math&gt; for some integer {{math|''n''}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \sec{ax} \right|\,dx = \frac{1}{a}\sgn(\sec{ax}) \ln(\left| \sec{ax} + \tan{ax} \right|)  + C &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;ax \in \left( n\pi - \frac{\pi}{2}, n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt; for some integer {{math|''n''}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \cot{ax} \right|\,dx = \frac{1}{a}\sgn(\cot{ax}) \ln(\left|\sin{ax}\right|) + C &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;ax \in \left( n\pi, n\pi + \pi \right) &lt;/math&gt; for some integer {{math|''n''}}.

If the function {{math|''f''}} does not have any continuous antiderivative which takes the value zero at the zeros of {{math|''f''}} (this is the case for the sine and the cosine functions), then {{math|sgn(''f''(''x'')) ∫ ''f''(''x'') ''dx''}} is an antiderivative of {{math|''f''}} on every [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] on which {{math|''f''}} is not zero, but may be discontinuous at the points where {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}}. For having a continuous antiderivative, one has thus to add a well chosen [[step function]]. If we also use the fact that the absolute values of sine and cosine are periodic with period {{pi}}, then we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \sin{ax} \right|\,dx = {2 \over a} \left\lfloor \frac{ax}{\pi} \right\rfloor - {1 \over a} \cos{\left( ax - \left\lfloor \frac{ax}{\pi} \right\rfloor \pi \right)} + C&lt;/math&gt; {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left|\cos {ax}\right|\,dx = {2 \over a} \left\lfloor \frac{ax}{\pi} + \frac12 \right\rfloor + {1 \over a} \sin{\left( ax - \left\lfloor \frac{ax}{\pi} + \frac12 \right\rfloor \pi \right)} + C&lt;/math&gt; {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Special functions===
Ci, Si: [[Trigonometric integral]]s,  Ei: [[Exponential integral]],  li: [[Logarithmic integral function]], erf: [[Error function]]
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{Ci}(x) \, dx = x \operatorname{Ci}(x) - \sin x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{Si}(x) \, dx = x \operatorname{Si}(x) + \cos x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{Ei}(x) \, dx = x \operatorname{Ei}(x) - e^x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{li}(x) \, dx = x \operatorname{li}(x)-\operatorname{Ei}(2 \ln x) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\operatorname{li}(x)}{x}\,dx = \ln x\, \operatorname{li}(x) -x &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{erf}(x)\, dx = \frac{e^{-x^2}}{\sqrt{\pi }}+x \operatorname{erf}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

==Definite integrals lacking closed-form antiderivatives==

There are some functions whose antiderivatives ''cannot'' be expressed in [[Closed-form expression|closed form]]. However, the values of the definite integrals of some of these functions over some common intervals can be calculated. A few useful integrals are given below.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \sqrt{x}\,e^{-x}\,dx = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt \pi&lt;/math&gt;  (see also [[Gamma function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty e^{-a x^2}\,dx = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt \frac {\pi} {a} &lt;/math&gt;  for {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}} (the [[Gaussian integral]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty{x^2 e^{-a x^2}\,dx} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt \frac {\pi} {a^3} &lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^{2n} e^{-a x^2}\,dx
= \frac{2n-1}{2a} \int_0^\infty x^{2(n-1)} e^{-a x^2}\,dx
= \frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^{n+1}} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a^{2n+1}}}
= \frac{(2n)!}{n! 2^{2n+1}} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a^{2n+1}}}
&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}, {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer and !! is the [[double factorial]].

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty{x^3 e^{-a x^2}\,dx} = \frac{1}{2 a^2} &lt;/math&gt; when {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^{2n+1} e^{-a x^2}\,dx
= \frac {n} {a} \int_0^\infty x^{2n-1} e^{-a x^2}\,dx
= \frac{n!}{2 a^{n+1}}
&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}, {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, ....}}

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^2}{6}&lt;/math&gt;  (see also [[Bernoulli number]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{e^x-1}\,dx = 2\zeta(3) \approx 2.40&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin{x}}{x}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[sinc function]] and [[Sine integral]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin^2{x}}{x^2}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\sin^n{x}\,dx = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \cos^n{x}\,dx = \frac{(n-1)!!}{n!!}\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (if {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer and !! is the [[double factorial]].

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\pi}^\pi \cos(\alpha x)\cos^n(\beta x) dx = \begin{cases}
\frac{2 \pi}{2^n} \binom{n}{m} &amp; |\alpha|= |\beta (2m-n)| \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''m'', ''n''}} integers with {{math|''β'' ≠ 0}} and {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}}, see also [[Binomial coefficient]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-t}^t \sin^m(\alpha x) \cos^n(\beta x) dx = 0&lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''α'', ''β''}} real, {{math|''n''}} a non-negative integer, and {{mvar|m}} an odd, positive integer; since the integrand is [[Odd function|odd]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\pi}^\pi \sin(\alpha x) \sin^n(\beta x) dx = \begin{cases}
(-1)^{\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)} (-1)^m \frac{2 \pi}{2^n} \binom{n}{m} &amp; n \text{ odd},\ \alpha = \beta (2m-n) \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''m'', ''n''}} integers with {{math|''β'' ≠ 0}} and {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}}, see also [[Binomial coefficient]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos(\alpha x) \sin^n(\beta x) dx = \begin{cases}
(-1)^{\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} (-1)^m \frac{2 \pi}{2^n} \binom{n}{m} &amp; n \text{ even},\ |\alpha| = |\beta (2m-n)| \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''m'', ''n''}} integers with {{math|''β'' ≠ 0}} and {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}}, see also [[Binomial coefficient]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-(ax^2+bx+c)}\,dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}\exp\left[\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a}\right]&lt;/math&gt;  (where {{math|exp[''u'']}} is the [[exponential function]] {{math|e&lt;sup&gt;''u''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}})

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty  x^{z-1}\,e^{-x}\,dx = \Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt;  (where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamma function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \left(\ln\frac{1}{x}\right)^p\,dx = \Gamma(p+1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1} dx = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)} &lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|Re(''α'') &gt; 0}} and {{math|Re(''β'') &gt; 0}}, see [[Beta function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2 \pi} e^{x \cos \theta} d \theta = 2 \pi I_{0}(x)&lt;/math&gt;  (where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is the modified [[Bessel function]] of the first kind)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2 \pi} e^{x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta} d \theta = 2 \pi I_{0} \left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu + 1}{2}}\,dx = \frac { \sqrt{\nu \pi} \ \Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)} {\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''ν'' &gt; 0}} , this is related to the [[probability density function]] of [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]])

If the function {{math|''f''}} has [[bounded variation]] on the interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}, then the [[method of exhaustion]] provides a formula for the integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b{f(x)\,dx} = (b - a) \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\sum\limits_{m = 1}^{2^n  - 1} {\left( { - 1} \right)^{m + 1} } } 2^{ - n} f(a + m\left( {b - a} \right)2^{-n} ).&lt;/math&gt;

The "[[sophomore's dream]]":
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_0^1 x^{-x}\,dx &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n}        &amp;&amp;(= 1.29128\,59970\,6266\dots)\\
\int_0^1 x^x   \,dx &amp;= -\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-n)^{-n} &amp;&amp;(= 0.78343\,05107\,1213\dots)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Louis Necker''', called '''de Germany''' (31 August 1730 in Geneva – 31 July 1804 in [[Cologny]]) was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] mathematician, physicist, professor and a banker in Paris. He was the elder brother of [[Jacques Necker]], minister of Finance in France when the French Revolution broke out. 

== Biography ==

Louis Necker studied mathematics and physics at the [[Academy of Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1990_num_8_1_1057 Frank A. Kafker :  ''Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie (suite et fin).''  Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie Année 1990 Volume 8 Numéro 8 p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his studies in philosophy with a thesis on electricity (1747), then graduated in law (1751). For a while he became the governor of probably [[Charles Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg]] and [[Simon August, Count of Lippe-Detmold]] during their stay in Geneva and traveled with them to the University of Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FZY1SmV_ArYC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6aS7uVCvIY&amp;sig=xmya3pBcWBX5AqCyLAsGYP-NljM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lippe-Detmold%20Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Madame de Staël: Her Friends, and Her Influence in Politics and Literature by Charlotte Blennerhassett, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=-VsmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D2n7sLENgy&amp;sig=i1VNYDnwhun_Rlz8e6TzU6zQ74g&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwBHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Necker by Ghislain de DIESBACH]&lt;/ref&gt; He managed a boarding school for young English held by his father Charles Frederick, lawyer and professor of law at the Geneva Academy. He was appointed as the [[hofmeister (office)|hofmeister]] of a Baron van [[Van Wassenaer]] and a [[Bentinck]]. 

In 1752 he purchased {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Jallabert|fr}}'s physics laboratory and in 1757 acceded the chair of mathematics and the honorary chair of Experimental Physics of the Academy of Geneva. As a correspondent of the [[Académie royale des sciences]] he had written an article for the Encyclopedia on [[Friction]] in mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/ The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclopédie]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1759 he lost his wife Isabelle André, whom he had married in 1752 and came from Marseille. In 1761 he was forced to resign from his professorship after a scandal (Vernes-Necker case).&lt;ref&gt;https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1762 with the help of his brother he was appointed in a trading house in Marseille and added to his last name de Germany, after the family estate near [[Rolle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FZY1SmV_ArYC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6aS7uVCvIY&amp;sig=xmya3pBcWBX5AqCyLAsGYP-NljM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lippe-Detmold%20Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Madame de Staël: Her Friends, and Her Influence in Politics and Literature by Charlotte Blennerhassett, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; He was dropped from the Académie des sciences's list of Corresponding Members in 1767.

In 1770 he moved to Paris. In 1772 he became a banker at {{Interlanguage link multi|Banque Girardot|fr|3=Banque Girardot|lt=Girardot Bank}}. In 1773 he remarried. Between 1774 and 1778 he must have been very busy collecting interest for his rich and noble clients in [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands. An astonishing number of notarial deeds are on his name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hetutrechtsarchief.nl/onderzoek/resultaten/archieven/zoekresultaat?mistart=68&amp;mivast=39&amp;mizig=236&amp;miadt=39&amp;miaet=54&amp;micode=34-4.U256c014&amp;milang=nl&amp;misort=last_mod%7Cdesc&amp;miview=ldt&amp;mizk_alle=Louis%20Necker&amp;mibj=1750&amp;miej=1800 Utrecht Archief]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776 he became [[resident (title)|resident]] for the [[Republic of Geneva]], succeeding his brother. When Emmanuel Haller was appointed in the Girardot bank in 1777, Louis became a silent partner. At some time (1777?) he became a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-24-02-0314]&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Necker was dismissed on 19 May 1781 as controller of the royal treasury. It seems the brothers were still cooperating as Jacques and Louis received annually 8 million livres as a pension.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9766891m/f1n300.pdf?download=1 Othénin d’Haussonville (2004) “La liquidation du ‘dépôt’ de Necker: entre concept et idée-force,”, p. 204 Cahiers staëliens, 55]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of changes during the liberal phase of the [[French Revolution]], he thought it prudent to return to his homeland in 1791. The disgrace of his younger brother Jacques, who resigned in 1790, contributed to his decision. The Neckers were far from welcome in Geneva. Many of the French émigrés considered them Jacobins, and many of the Swiss Jacobins thought them conservative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/ The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclopédie]&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Jacques (1757-1825), who had joined the French army, married [[Albertine Necker de Saussure]] in 1785. The French Revolution ended his military career. In 1790, he began teaching as a demonstrator in botany at the [[Academy of Geneva]] as Professor of Botany.

{{Special characters}}

'''Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols''' are [[Unicode blocks]] of [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters and decimal [[numerical digit|digits]] that enable mathematicians to denote different notions with different letter styles. The letters in various fonts often have specific, fixed meanings in particular areas of mathematics. By providing uniformity over numerous mathematical articles and books, these conventions help to read mathematical formulae.

[[Unicode]] now includes many such symbols (in the range U+1D400&amp;ndash;U+1D7FF).&amp;nbsp; The rationale behind this is that it enables design and usage of special mathematical characters ([[typeface|fonts]]) that include all necessary properties to differentiate from other alphanumerics, e.g. in mathematics an ''italic'' "A" can have a different meaning from a ''roman'' letter "A". Unicode originally included a limited set of such letter forms in its [[Letterlike Symbols]] block before completing the set of Latin and Greek letter forms in this block beginning in version 3.1. 

Unicode expressly recommends that these characters not be used in general text as a substitute for [[markup language|presentational markup]]; the letters are specifically designed to be semantically different from each other. Unicode does ''not'' include a set of normal serif letters in the set (thus it assumes a given font is a serif by default; a sans-serif font that supports the range would thus display the standard letters and the "sans-serif" symbols identically but could not display normal serif symbols of the same).

All these letter shapes may be manipulated with [[MathML]]'s attribute mathvariant.

The introduction date of some of the more commonly used symbols can be found in the [[Table of mathematical symbols by introduction date]].

==Tables==
&lt;!--You will probably only see empty boxes or question marks in most cells of the following tables unless you have a suitable [[Unicode]] font (such as [[Code2001]]) and a browser (such as [[Mozilla Firefox]]) and operating system supporting Unicode characters outside the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]].--&gt;

{{legend4|pink|These characters are located in other Unicode blocks, such as [[letterlike symbols (Unicode block)|letterlike symbols]]. For example, ℛ ({{smallcaps|{{lc:SCRIPT CAPITAL R}}}}) is at U+211B. Note that the "normal" column only has serifs if the current font has serifs. The code points that the characters with pink background replace are reserved, and the Unicode standard annotates them with the name and code point of the correct character.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A few characters have names that indicate they should be replacements but are not.
* {{unichar|2113| SCRIPT SMALL L}} is not used as it is a special symbol for [[litre]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf Unicode code chart U1D400 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{unichar|2118| SCRIPT CAPITAL P}} is in fact the [[Weierstrass p]] which was misnamed, but due to Unicode stability policies the official character name cannot be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Mathematics and architecture''' are related, since, [[mathematics and art|as with other arts]], [[architect]]s use [[mathematics]] for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering [[building]]s, architects use [[geometry]]: to define the spatial form of a building; from the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, [[aesthetic]] and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

In &lt;!--[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient China]], Needs section in article before we put this here--&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Architecture of India|India]], and the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]], buildings including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, mosques, palaces and [[mausoleum]]s were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric tiling patterns]] are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a [[fractal]]-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in [[Hindu cosmology]]. In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.

In [[Renaissance architecture]], [[symmetry]] and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], influenced by [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'' from [[Ancient Rome]] and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.
At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Vladimir Shukhov]] in [[Russia]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] in [[Barcelona]] pioneered the use of [[hyperboloid structures]]; in the [[Sagrada Família]], Gaudí also incorporated [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s, tessellations, [[catenary arch]]es, [[catenoid]]s, [[helicoid]]s, and [[ruled surface]]s. In the twentieth century, styles such as [[modern architecture]] and [[Deconstructivism]] explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. [[Minimal surface]]s have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at [[Denver International Airport]], while [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]] pioneered the use of the strong [[thin-shell structure]]s known as [[geodesic dome]]s.

==Connected fields==
[[File:CdM, presunto autoritratto di leon battista alberti, white ground.jpg|thumb|upright|In the [[Renaissance]], an [[architect]] like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was expected to be knowledgeable in many disciplines, including [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]].]]

The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between [[architecture]] and [[mathematics]], note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure [[Number theory|study of number]] and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Ancient Rome, [[Vitruvius]] described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily [[geometry]], to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the [[Middle Ages]], where graduates learnt [[arithmetic]], geometry and [[aesthetics]] alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the [[trivium]]) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the [[Renaissance]], the [[quadrivium]] of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the [[Renaissance man]] such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Similarly in England, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.&lt;ref name=Ostwald1&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: from Antiquity to the 1500s |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00136-4 |pages=chapter 1. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]], identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be [[revolutionary]], introducing wholly new ideas; [[reactionary]], failing to introduce change; or [[revivalist artist|revivalist]], actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian [[Mannerism]] of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century [[Baroque]] and [[Palladian]] movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as [[Futurism]] and [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to [[Modernist]] architecture. Towards the end of the 20th century, too, [[fractal]] geometry was quickly seized upon by architects, as was [[aperiodic tiling]], to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume II: The 1500s to the Future |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00142-5 |pages=chapter 48. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architects use mathematics for several reasons, leaving aside the necessary use of mathematics in the [[Architectural engineering|engineering of buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Architectural Engineering Overview |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/archeng/archeng.pdf |publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building.&lt;ref name=Leyton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leyton |first1=Michael |title=A Generative Theory of Shape |date=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-42717-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, they use mathematics to design forms that are [[aesthetic|considered beautiful]] or harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stakhov |first1=Alexey |last2=Olsen |first2=Olsen |title=The Mathematics of Harmony: From Euclid to Contemporary Mathematics and Computer Science |date=2009 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-277-582-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] with their religious philosophy of number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |authorlink1=William Smith (lexicographer) |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |date=1870 |publisher=Little, Brown |page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; architects in [[Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]] and the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] have chosen the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of the built environment – buildings and their designed surroundings – according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles.&lt;ref name=Vitruvius2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tennant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rai/&gt;&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Thirdly, they may use mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s to decorate buildings.&lt;ref name=Utrecht&gt;{{cite web |last1=van den Hoeven |first1=Saskia |last2=van der Veen |first2=Maartje |title=Muqarnas: Mathematics in Islamic Arts |url=http://www.jphogendijk.nl/projects/muqarnas2010.pdf |publisher=Utrecht University |accessdate=30 September 2015 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cucker103&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felipe |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourthly, they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise whirling air currents at the base of tall buildings.&lt;ref name=Freiberger/&gt;

====Vitruvius====
{{further information|Vitruvius|Vitruvian module|De architectura}}
[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The interior of the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], 1758]]

The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and ''symmetria''. Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. ''Symmetria'' in Vitruvius's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at [[Fano]], he uses ratios of small integers, especially the [[triangular number]]s (1, 3, 6, 10,&amp;nbsp;...) to proportion the structure into [[Vitruvian module|(Vitruvian) modules]].{{efn|In Book 4, chapter 3 of ''[[De architectura]]'', he discusses modules directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitruvius |title=VITRUVIUS, BOOK IV, CHAPTER 3 On the Doric order |url=http://www.vitruvius.be/boek4h3.htm|website=Vitruvius.be |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus the Basilica's width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitruvius |title=On Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBLNbOp46CYC&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-193195-1 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dehio 1 Pantheon Floor plan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Pantheon]]

Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his ''[[De architectura]]'', c. 15 B.C.: firmness, usefulness (or "Commodity" in [[Henry Wotton]]'s 16th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsOstwald2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Kim |last2=Ostwald |first2=Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: Antiquity to the 1500s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWKYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |date=9 February 2015 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-319-00137-1 |pages=42, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Pantheon====
{{main article|Pantheon (Rome)}}

[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], [[Florence]], 1470. The frieze (with squares) and above is by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].]]

The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti's 1450 ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius's ''De architectura'' and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:{{radic|2}}, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:{{radic|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=March |first1=Lionel |title=Renaissance mathematics and architectural proportion in Alberti's De re aedificatoria |journal=Architectural Research Quarterly |date=1996 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–65 |doi=10.1017/S135913550000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sphere circumscribing a cube |url=http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/solid-mensuration-solid-geometry/013-insciribed-and-circumscribed-sphere-about-cube-volume- |website=Mathalino.com Engineering Math Review |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti also documented [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s discovery of [[linear perspective]], developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The next major text was [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s ''Regole generali d'architettura'' (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books 1 and 2) covered geometry and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]].

The [[pyramid]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]] are [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|tombs]] constructed with deliberately chosen proportions, but which these were has been debated. The face angle is about 51°85’, and the ratio of the slant height to half the base length is 1.619, less than 1% from the [[golden ratio]].

The mathematics of [[fractals]] has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall [[gopuram]] gatehouses of [[Hindu]] temples such as the [[Virupaksha Temple, Hampi|Virupaksha Temple]] at [[Hampi]] built in the seventh century, and others such as the [[Kandariya Mahadev Temple]] at [[Khajuraho]], the parts and the whole have the same character, with [[fractal dimension]] in the range 1.7 to 1.8.

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that "all things are numbers". They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word ''symmetria'' originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building's smallest details right up to its entire design.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.

The [[Parthenon]] is {{convert|69.5|m|ft}} long, {{convert|30.9|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|13.7|m|ft}} high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight&lt;ref name="Maor2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maor|first=Eli|title=The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-year History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12526-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pythagoreans 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This sets the module as 0.858&amp;nbsp;m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ({{convert|21.44|m|ft}} wide by 48.3&amp;nbsp;m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, {{convert|1.905|m|ft}}, and the spacing of their centres, {{convert|4.293|m|ft}}, is also 4:9.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The Parthenon is considered by authors such as [[John Julius Norwich]] "the most perfect Doric temple ever built".&lt;ref name=Norwich/&gt; Its elaborate architectural refinements include "a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns".&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;{{cite book |author=Norwich, John Julius |title=Great Architecture of the World |publisher=Artists House |year=2001 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penrose, Francis |title=Principles of Athenian Architecture |publisher=Society of Dilettanti |year=1973 |origyear=1851 |page=ch. II.3, plate 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: "all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, Gorham P. |title=Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=66 |issue=3 |date=July 1962 |pages=337–338 |doi=10.2307/501468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden ratio was known in 300 B.C., when [[Euclid]] described the method of geometric construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euclid's Elements|Euclid. ''Elements'']]. Book 6, Proposition 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings, as well as sculptures, paintings, and vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Archibald, R.

[[File:Selimiye Mosque.png|thumb|upright|Selimiye Mosque, 1569–1575]]

The [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]], Turkey, was built by [[Mimar Sinan]] to provide a space where the [[mihrab]] could be see from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by 8 enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of {{convert|31.25|m|ft}} diameter and {{convert|43|m|ft}} high. The octagon is formed into a square with four semidomes, and externally by four exceptionally tall minarets, {{convert|83|m|ft}} tall.

[[Mughal architecture]], as seen in the abandoned imperial city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]] and the [[Taj Mahal]] complex, has a distinctive mathematical order and a strong aesthetic based on symmetry and harmony.&lt;ref name=Rai&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rai |first1=Jaswant |title=Mathematics and Aesthetics in Islamic Architecture: Reference to Fatehpur Sikri |journal=Journal of King Saud University, Architecture &amp; Planning |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=19–48 |date=1993 |url=http://repository.ksu.edu.sa/jspui/handle/123456789/560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michell |first1=George |last2=Pasricha |first2=Amit |title=Mughal Architecture &amp; Gardens |date=2011 |publisher=Antique Collectors Club |isbn=978-1-85149-670-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white marble [[mausoleum]], decorated with [[pietra dura]], the great gate (''Darwaza-i rauza''), other buildings, the gardens and paths together form a unified hierarchical design. The buildings include a [[mosque]] in red sandstone on the west, and an almost identical building, the Jawab or 'answer' on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex. The formal [[charbagh]] ('fourfold garden') is in four parts, symbolising the four rivers of paradise, and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum. These are divided in turn into 16 parterres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Koch | first=Ebba | title=The Complete Taj Mahal: And the Riverfront Gardens of Agra| edition=1st| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | isbn=0-500-34209-1| pages=24 and passim | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taj site plan.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Site plan of the Taj Mahal complex. The great gate is at the right, the mausoleum in the centre, bracketed by the mosque (below) and the jawab. The plan includes squares and [[octagon]]s.]]

The Taj Mahal complex was laid out on a grid, subdivided into smaller grids. The historians of architecture Koch and Barraud agree with the traditional accounts that give the width of the complex as 374 Mughal yards or [[gaz (measure)|gaz]],{{efn|1 gaz is about {{convert|0.86|m|ft}}.}} the main area being three 374-gaz squares. These were divided in areas like the bazaar and caravanserai into 17-gaz modules; the garden and terraces are in modules of 23 gaz, and are 368 gaz wide (16 x 23). The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz. Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon, used repeatedly in the complex, is given sides of 7 units, then it has a width of 17 units,{{efn|A square drawn around the octagon by prolonging alternate sides adds four right angle triangles with hypotenuse of 7 and the other two sides of {{radic|49/2}} or 4.9497..., nearly 5.

Islamic buildings are often decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] which typically make use of several mathematical [[tessellations]], formed of ceramic tiles ([[girih]], [[zellige]]) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Symmetries such as stars with six, eight, or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns. Some of these are based on the 'Khatem Sulemani' or Solomon's seal motif, which is an eight-pointed star made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees from the other on the same centre.&lt;ref name=Ronning&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/ronning%20_geometry_and_Islamic_patterns.pdf | title=Islamic Patterns And Symmetry Groups | publisher=University of Exeter | accessdate=18 April 2014 | author=Rønning, Frode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic patterns exploit many of the 17 possible [[wallpaper groups]]; as early as 1944, Edith Müller showed that the Alhambra made use of 11 wallpaper groups in its decorations, while in 1986 [[Branko Grünbaum]] claimed to have found 13 wallpaper groups in the Alhambra, asserting controversially that the remaining 4 groups are not found anywhere in Islamic ornament.&lt;ref name=Ronning/&gt;

===Modern architectural decoration===
{{further information|Ornament (art)|Contemporary architecture}}

Towards the end of the 20th century, novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48/&gt; In 1913, the Modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] had declared that "Ornament is a crime",&lt;ref name=Gibberd&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibberd |first1=Matt |last2=Hill |first2=Albert |title=The Return of Ornamentation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/7279/the-return-of-ornamentation.html |accessdate=12 October 2015 |work=The Telegraph |date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; influencing architectural thinking for the rest of the 20th century. In the 21st century, architects are again starting to explore the use of [[Ornament (art)|ornament]]. 21st century ornamentation is extremely diverse. Henning Larsen's 2011 [[Harpa Concert and Conference Centre]], Reykjavik has what looks like a crystal wall of rock made of large blocks of glass.&lt;ref name=Gibberd/&gt; Foreign Office Architects' 2010 [[Ravensbourne College]], London is tessellated decoratively with 28,000 anodised aluminium tiles in red, white and brown, interlinking circular windows of differing sizes.

==Defence==

===Europe===
{{further information|Star fort}}

The architecture of [[fortification]]s evolved from [[medieval fortification|medieval fortresses]], which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical [[star fort]]s able to resist [[artillery]] bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include [[Michelangelo]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]], [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] and [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Duffy, C. |year=1975 |title=Fire &amp; Stone, The Science of Fortress Warfare 1660–1860 |publisher=Booksales |isbn=978-0-7858-2109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler |first1=David |title=The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough |date=1990 |publisher=Spellmount |isbn=978-0-946771-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural historian [[Siegfried Giedion]] argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance [[Urban planning|ideal city]]: "The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giedion, Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Giedion |title=Space, Time and Architecture |publisher=Harvard University Press |origyear=1941 |date=1962 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===China===
[[File:HakkaYongding.jpg|thumb|A [[tulou]] in [[Yongding County]], [[Fujian province]]]]

In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Neill |first1=Tom |title=China's Remote Fortresses Lose Residents, Gain Tourists |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150102-hakka-china-tulou-fujian-world-heritage-culture-housing/ |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=6 January 2017 |date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental goals==
[[File:Yakhchal of Yazd province.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yakhchal]] in [[Yazd]], Iran]]

Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals.&lt;ref name="SimitchWarke2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simitch |first1=Andrea |last2=Warke |first2=Val |title=The Language of Architecture: 26 Principles Every Architect Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2v-1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191 |year=2014 |publisher=Rockport Publishers |isbn=978-1-62788-048-0 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Foster and Partners]]' [[30 St Mary Axe]], London, known as "[[#Top|The Gherkin]]"&lt;!--links to top (lead image)--&gt; for its [[cucumber]]-like shape, is a [[solid of revolution]] designed using [[Computer aided design|parametric modelling]]. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise whirling air currents at its base. Despite the building's apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are [[quadrilateral]]s, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.&lt;ref name=Freiberger&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freiberger |first1=Marianne |title=Perfect buildings: the maths of modern architecture |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/perfect-buildings-maths-modern-architecture|publisher=Plus magazine|accessdate=5 October 2015|date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[yakhchal]] (ice pit) of [[Iran|Persia]] functioned as an [[evaporative cooler]]. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well. The subterranean space and the thick heat-resistant construction insulated the storage space year round. The internal space was often further cooled with [[windcatcher]]s. The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen dessert [[faloodeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahdavinejad |first=M. |author2=Javanrudi, Kavan |title=Assessment of Ancient Fridges: A Sustainable Method to Storage Ice in Hot-Arid Climates |journal=Asian Culture and History |date=July 2012 |volume=4 |issue=2 |doi=10.5539/ach.v4n2p133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas from '''[[Mathematics]]''' have been used as inspiration for '''[[fiber art]]s''' including [[quilt]] [[quilting|making]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]] and [[weaving]]. A wide range of mathematical concepts have been used as inspiration including [[topology]], [[graph theory]], [[number theory]] and [[algebra]]. Some techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]] are naturally [[geometry|geometrical]]; other kinds of [[textile]] provide a ready means for the colorful [[mathematics and art|physical expression of mathematical concepts]].

==Quilting==
{{main|quilt}}

The [[IEEE Spectrum]] has organized a number of competitions on [[quilt block]] design, and several books have been published on the subject. Notable quiltmakers include Diana Venters and Elaine Ellison, who have written a book on the subject ''Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required''. Examples of mathematical ideas used in the book as the basis of a quilt include the [[golden rectangle]], [[conic section]]s, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s Claw, the [[Koch curve]], the [[Clifford torus]], [[San Gaku]], [[Lorenzo Mascheroni|Mascheroni]]'s [[cardioid]], [[Pythagorean triple]]s, [[spidron]]s, and the six [[trigonometric functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ellison | first1=Elaine | last2=Venters | first2=Diana | isbn=1-55953-317-X | publisher=Key Curriculum | title=Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required | year=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitting and crochet==
[[Image:Cross stitch embroidery.jpg|thumb|[[Cross-stitch]] [[counted-thread embroidery]]]]

Knitted mathematical objects include the [[Platonic solid]]s, [[Klein bottle]]s and [[Boy's surface]].
The [[Lorenz attractor|Lorenz manifold]] and the [[Hyperbolic manifold|hyperbolic plane]] have been crafted using crochet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Henderson | first1 = David | last2 = Taimina | first2 = Daina | author2-link = Daina Taimina | doi = 10.1007/BF03026623 | issue = 2 | journal = [[Mathematical Intelligencer]]

==Embroidery==

[[File:Florentin.png|thumb|upright|Two [[Bargello (needlework)|Bargello patterns]]]]

Embroidery techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]]&lt;ref&gt;Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance. ''World Textiles'', Little, Brown, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[cross-stitch]] and some [[canvas work]] methods such as [[Bargello (needlework)]] make use of the natural [[pixel]]s of the weave, lending themselves to geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Barbara.

==Weaving==

[[Ada Dietz]] (1882 &amp;ndash; 1950) was an American [[weaving|weaver]] best known for her 1949 monograph ''Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles'', which defines weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate [[polynomial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Dietz | first = Ada K. | location = Louisville, Kentucky

Each one has a different user interface. This picture shows clockwise from top left: An [[Arithmometer]], a [[Comptometer]], a Dalton adding machine, a Sundstrand and an [[Odhner Arithmometer]]]]

A '''mechanical calculator''', or '''calculating machine''', is a mechanical device used to perform automatically the basic operations of [[arithmetic]]. Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small [[desktop computer]]s and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the [[electronic calculator]].

Surviving notes from [[Wilhelm Schickard]] in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation. His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of [[Napier's bones]], to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions.  A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that would have jammed after a few entries on the same dial,&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], History of Computing Technology, IEEE Computer Society, p. 122 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999).&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], History of Computing Technology, IEEE Computer Society, p. 124, 128 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Schickard abandoned his project in 1624 and never mentioned it again until his death 11 years later in 1635.

Two decades after Schickard's supposedly failed attempt, in 1642, [[Blaise Pascal]] decisively solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. René Cassin, Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942), [[#NAT_MEP|Magazine Nature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Co-opted into his father's labour as [[tax collector]] in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required;&lt;ref name="INVENT"&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin (1994)]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; it was called [[Pascal's Calculator]] or Pascaline.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pascal's calculator#Competing designs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arithmometer|Thomas' arithmometer]], the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured two hundred years later in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;Beside two arithmometer clone makers from Germany and England, the only other company to offer calculators for sale was Felt &amp; Tarrant from the USA which started selling their comptometer in 1887 but had only sold 100 machines by 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comptometer]], introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard which consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured from 1902, was the first to have a 10 key keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARTIN|Ernst Martin]] p. 133 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric motor]]s were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARTIN|Ernst Martin]] p. 23 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|Anita mk7]] from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop in the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.

[[Charles Babbage]] designed two new kinds of mechanical calculators, which were so big that they required the power of a [[steam engine]] to operate, and that were too sophisticated to be built in his lifetime.  The first one was an ''automatic'' mechanical calculator, his [[difference engine]], which could automatically compute and print mathematical tables. In 1855, [[Per Georg Scheutz|Georg Scheutz]] became the first of a handful of designers to succeed at building a smaller and simpler model of his difference engine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG,Jean Marguin]] p. 171, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The second one was a ''programmable'' mechanical calculator, his [[analytical engine]], which Babbage started to design in 1834; "in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern [[computer]]. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the [[Jacquard loom]]"&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Hyman, ''Charles Babbage, pioneer of the computer'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt; making it infinitely programmable.&lt;ref&gt;"The introduction of punched cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums, or because programs could now be of unlimited extent, and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand; it was important also because it served to crystallize Babbage's feeling that he had invented something really new, something much more than a sophisticated calculating machine." [[#COLLIER|Bruce Collier]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1937, [[Howard Aiken]] convinced [[IBM]] to design and build the [[Harvard Mark I|ASCC/Mark I]], the first machine of its kind, based on the architecture of the analytical engine;&lt;ref&gt;[[#AIKEN|I. Bernard Cohen]], p. 66-67, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; when the machine was finished some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".&lt;ref&gt;[[#ORIGINS|Brian Randell]], p. 187, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Arithmetic|Abacus}}
{{quote | The desire to economize time and mental effort in arithmetical computations, and to eliminate [[human error|human liability to error]], is probably as old as the science of arithmetic itself. This desire has led to the design and construction of a variety of aids to calculation, beginning with groups of small objects, such as pebbles, first used loosely, later as counters on ruled boards, and later still as beads mounted on wires fixed in a frame, as in the abacus. This instrument was probably invented by the Semitic races and later adopted in India, whence it spread westward throughout Europe and eastward to China and Japan.&lt;br&gt;
After the development of the abacus, no further advances were made until John Napier devised his numbering rods, or [[Napier's Bones]], in 1617. Various forms of the Bones appeared, some approaching the beginning of mechanical computation, but it was not until 1642 that Blaise Pascal gave us the first mechanical calculating machine in the sense that the term is used today.|[[Howard Aiken]], Proposed automatic calculating machine, presented to IBM in 1937}}

{{further|Pascal's calculator#Precursors}}
A short list of other precursors to the mechanical calculator must include a group of mechanical [[analog computer]]s which, once set, are only modified by the continuous and repeated action of their actuators (crank handle, weight, wheel, water...).  Before [[common era]], there are [[odometer]]s and the [[Antikythera mechanism]], an out of place, unique, geared [[astronomical clock]], followed more than a millennium later by early mechanical [[clock]]s, geared [[astrolabes]] and followed in the 15th century by [[pedometer]]s. These machines were all made of [[toothed gear]]s linked by some sort of carry mechanisms.  These machines always produce identical results for identical initial settings unlike a mechanical calculator where all the wheels are independent but are also linked together by the rules of arithmetic.

==The 17th century==

===Overview===
The 17th century marked the beginning of the history of mechanical calculators, as it saw the invention of its first machines, including [[Pascal's calculator]], in 1642.&lt;ref name="INVENT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Please see [[Pascaline#Pascal versus Schickard]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] had invented a machine which he presented as being able to perform computations that were previously thought to be only humanly possible,&lt;ref&gt;"The arithmetical machine produces effects which approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals. But it does nothing which would enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals.", Pascal, Pensées [//www.bartleby.com/48/1/6.html Bartleby.com, Great Books online, Blaise Pasdcal, Thoughts]&lt;/ref&gt; but he wasn't successful in creating an industry.

{{quote |In a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal.|S. Chapman|Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942)&lt;ref name="tercent"&gt;[[#NAT_CHAP|Magazine Nature]], (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 17th century also saw the invention of some very powerful tools to aid arithmetic calculations like [[Napier's bones]], [[Mathematical table#Tables of logarithms|logarithmic tables]] and the [[slide rule]] which, for their ease of use by scientists in multiplying and dividing, ruled over and impeded the use and development of mechanical calculators&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCRI|Scripta Mathematica]], p. 128 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; until the production release of the [[arithmometer]] in the mid 19th century.
[[File:17th-century-mechanical-calculators -Detail.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.0|Four of Pascal's calculators and one machine built by Lépine in 1725,&lt;ref&gt;[[#350YEARS|From the calculating machine of Pascal to the computer]], p. 43 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]]]]

===Invention of the mechanical calculator===
[[Blaise Pascal]] invented a mechanical calculator with a sophisticated carry mechanism in 1642. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Machine_d%E2%80%99arithm%C3%A9tique (fr) La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal], Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; he introduced his calculator to the public. He built twenty of these machines in the following ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat, p. 12 (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This machine could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition. Since, unlike Schickard's machine, the Pascaline dials could only rotate in one direction zeroing it after each calculation required the operator to dial in all 9s and then ([[Pascal's calculator#Resetting the machine|method of {{nowrap|re-zeroing}}]]) propagate a carry right through the machine.&lt;ref name="CR_RESET"&gt;[[#COURRIER|Courrier du CIBP]], N°8, p. 9, (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that the carry mechanism would have proved itself in practice many times over. This is a testament to the quality of the Pascaline because none of the 17th and 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet it was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.&lt;ref name="NO_BLOC"&gt;"...''et si blocage il y avait, la machine était pratiquement inutilisable, ce qui ne fut jamais signalé dans les textes du XVIIIe siecle parmi ses défaults''" [[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p. 30 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | Pascal's invention of the calculating machine, just three hundred years ago, was made while he was a youth of nineteen. He was spurred to it by seeing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen. He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life. But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use. Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions...|S. Chapman|Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942)&lt;ref name="tercent"/&gt;}}

In 1672, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] started working on adding direct multiplication to what he understood was the working of Pascal's calculator. However, it is doubtful that he had ever fully seen the mechanism and the method could not have worked because of the lack of reversible rotation in the mechanism. Accordingly,  he eventually designed an entirely new machine called the [[Stepped Reckoner]]; it used his [[Leibniz wheel]]s, was the first two-motion calculator, the first to use cursors (creating a memory of the first operand) and the first to have a movable carriage. Leibniz built two Stepped Reckoners, one in 1694 and one in 1706.&lt;ref name="LEIB"&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p. 64-65 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the machine built in 1694 is known to exist, it was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century having been forgotten in an attic in the [[University of Göttingen]].&lt;ref name="LEIB"/&gt;
{{quote |In 1893, the German calculating machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to put Leibniz machine in operating condition if possible. His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCRI|Scripta Mathematica]], p. 149 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Leibniz had invented his namesake wheel and the principle of a two motion calculator, but after forty years of development he wasn't able to produce a machine that was fully operational&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morar|first=Florin-Stefan|date=March 2015|title=Reinventing machines: the transmission history of the Leibniz calculator|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-for-the-history-of-science/article/reinventing-machines-the-transmission-history-of-the-leibniz-calculator/0EFE30C7B3975C7ADF10627D20CC3F07|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|volume=48|issue=1|pages=123–146|doi=10.1017/S0007087414000429|issn=0007-0874}}&lt;/ref&gt;; this makes Pascal's calculator the only working mechanical calculator in the 17th century. Leibniz was also the first person to describe a [[pinwheel calculator]].&lt;ref name="PINWHEEL"&gt;[[#SMITH|David Smith]], p. 173-181 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; He once said "It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in {{harvnb|Smith|1929|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other calculating machines===
Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz were inevitably inspired by the role of clockwork which was highly celebrated in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.TheModernEpochAndTheEmergenceOfTheModernCalculator#schickard http://things-that-count.net]&lt;/ref&gt; However, simple minded application of interlinked gears was insufficient for any of their purposes.  Schickard introduced the use of a single toothed "mutilated gear" to enable the carry to take place.  Pascal improved on that with his famous weighted sautoir.  Leibniz went even further in relation to the ability to use a moveable carriage to perform multiplication more efficiently, albeit at the expense of a fully working carry mechanism.

{{quote|...I devised a third which works by springs and which has a very simple design. This is the one, as I have already stated, that I used many times, hidden in the plain sight of an infinity of persons and which is still in operating order. Nevertheless, while always improving on it, I found reasons to change its design...|Pascal|Advertisement Necessary to those who have curiosity to see the Arithmetic Machine, and to operate it (1645)&lt;ref&gt;Translated from "j'en composai une troisième qui va par ressorts et qui est très simple en sa construction. C'est celle de laquelle, comme j'ai déjà dit, je me suis servi plusieurs fois, au vu et su d'une infinité de personnes, et qui est encore en état de servir autant que jamais. Toutefois, en la perfectionnant toujours, je trouvai des raisons de la changer" [[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique#Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir|Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir]] Wikisource: La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|When, several years ago, I saw for the first time an instrument which, when carried, automatically records the numbers of steps by a pedestrian, it occurred to me at once that the entire arithmetic could be subjected to a similar kind of machinery so that not only counting but also addition and subtraction, multiplication and division could be accomplished by a suitably arranged machine easily, promptly, and with sure results|Leibniz|on his calculating machine (1685)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#SMITH|David Smith]], p. 173, (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The principle of the clock (input wheels and display wheels added to a clock like mechanism) for a direct entry calculating machine couldn't be implemented to create a fully effective calculating machine without additional innovation with the technological capabilities of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 124, 128 (1997) for Schikard's machine and the fact that the machines built by Burattini, Morland and Grillet were calculating clocks without a completely effective carry mechanism.&lt;/ref&gt; because their gears would jam when a carry had to be moved several places along the accumulator. The only 17th century calculating clocks that have survived to this day do not have a machine wide carry mechanism and therefore cannot be called fully effective mechanical calculators. A much more successful calculating clock was built by the Italian [[Giovanni Poleni]] in the 18th century and was a two-motion calculating clock (the numbers are inscribed first and then they are processed).

* In 1623, [[Wilhelm Schickard]], a German professor of Hebrew and Astronomy, designed a calculating clock which he drew on two letters that he wrote to [[Johannes Kepler]]. The first machine to be built by a professional was destroyed during its construction and Schickard abandoned his project in 1624. These drawings had appeared in various publications over the centuries, starting in 1718 with a book of Kepler's letters by [[Michael Gottlieb Hansch|Michael Hansch]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/Pioneers/Schickard.html History of computer] (retrieved on 01/02/2012)&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1957 it was presented for the first time as a long lost mechanical calculator by Dr. Franz Hammer. The building of the first replica in the 1960s showed that Schickard's machine had an unfinished design and therefore wheels and springs were added to make it work.&lt;ref name="UNFINISHED"&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 122 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these replicas showed that the single tooth wheel, when used within a calculating clock, was an inadequate carry mechanism.&lt;ref name=NOTDO&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 124, 128 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Pascal's Calculator#Pascal versus Schickard|see Pascal versus Schickard]]).  This did not mean that such a machine could not be used in practice, but the operator when faced with the mechanism resisting rotation, in the unusual circumstances of a carry being required beyond (say) 3 dials, would need to "help" the subsequent carry to propagate.
* Around 1643, a French clockmaker from Rouen, after hearing of Pascal's work, built what he claimed to be a calculating clock of his own design. Pascal fired all his employees and stopped developing his calculator as soon as he heard of the news.&lt;ref&gt;"The appearance of this small ''avorton'' disturbed me to the utmost and it dampened the enthusiasm with which I was developing my calculator so much that I immediately let go all of my employees..." translated from the French: "L'aspect de ce petit avorton me déplut au dernier point et refroidit tellement l'ardeur avec laquelle je faisais lors travailler à l'accomplissement de mon modèle qu'à l'instant même je donnai congé à tous les ouvriers..."&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only after being assured that his invention would be protected by a royal privilege that he restarted his activity.&lt;ref&gt;"But, later on, Lord Chancellor of France [...] granted me a royal privilege which is not usual, and which will suffocate before their birth all these illegitimate ''avortons'' which, by the way, could only be born of the legitimate and necessary alliance of theory and art." translated from the French: "Mais, quelque temps après, Monseigneur le Chancelier [...] par la grâce qu'il me fit de m'accorder un privilège qui n'est pas ordinaire, et qui étouffe avant leur naissance tous ces avortons illégitimes qui pourraient être engendrés d'ailleurs que de la légitime et nécessaire alliance de la théorie avec l'art"&lt;/ref&gt;  A careful examination of this calculating clock showed that it didn't work properly and Pascal called it an ''avorton'' (aborted fetus).&lt;ref&gt;"...a useless piece, perfectly clean, polished and well filed on the outside but so imperfect inside that it is of no use whatsoever." translated from the French: "...qu'une pièce inutile, propre véritablement, polie et très bien limée par le dehors, mais tellement imparfaite au dedans qu'elle n'est d'aucun usage"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All the quotes in this paragraph are found in (fr) [[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique#Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir|Wikisource: Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1659, the Italian [[Tito Livio Burattini]] built a machine with nine independent wheels, each one of these wheels was paired with a smaller carry wheel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35423 Picture of Burattini's machine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609022832/http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35423 |date=2010-06-09 }} Florence, Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza, inv. 3179 (accessed on January, 09 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of an operation the user had to either manually add each carry to the next digit or mentally add these numbers to create the final result.
* In 1666, [[Samuel Morland]] invented a machine designed to add sums of money,&lt;ref name="Chronicle, p. 12"&gt;[[#CHRONICLE|A calculator Chronicle, ''300 years of counting and reckoning tools'']], p. 12, IBM&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not a true adding machine since the carry was added to a small carry wheel situated above each digit and not directly to the next digit. It was very similar to Burattini's machine. Morland created also a multiplying machines with interchangeable disks based on Napier's bones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p.140 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35418 Picture of Morland multiplying machine] Florence, Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza, inv. 679 (retrieved on January, 09 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Taken together these two machines provided a capacity similar to that of the invention of Schickard, although it is doubtful that Morland ever encountered Schickard's calculating clock.
* In 1673, the French clockmaker [[René Grillet de Roven|René Grillet]] described in ''Curiositez mathématiques de l'invention du Sr Grillet, horlogeur à Paris'' a calculating machine that would be more compact than Pascal's calculator and reversible for subtraction. The only two Grillet machines known&lt;ref&gt;They belong to the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; have no carry mechanism, displaying three lines of nine independent dials they also have nine rotating napier's rod for multiplication and division. Contrary to Grillet's claim, it was not a mechanical calculator after all.&lt;ref&gt;"Grillet's machine doesn't even deserve the name of machine" translated from the French "La machine de Grillet ne mérite donc pas même le nom de machine", [[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p.76 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 18th century==

===Overview===
{{further|Pinwheel calculator|Leibniz wheel}}
The 18th century saw the first mechanical calculator that could perform a multiplication automatically; designed and built by [[Giovanni Poleni]] in 1709 and made of wood, it was the first successful calculating clock. For all the machines built in this century, division still required the operator to decide when to stop a repeated subtraction at each index, and therefore these machines were only providing a help in dividing, like an [[abacus]]. Both pinwheel calculators and Leibniz wheel calculators were built with a few unsuccessful attempts at their commercialization.

===Prototypes and limited runs===
* In 1709, the Italian [[Giovanni Poleni]] was the first to build a calculator that could multiply automatically.  It used a pinwheel design, was the first operational ''calculating clock'' and was made of wood;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoscienza.org/approfondimenti/documenti/macchina_poleni/replica.asp Copy of Poleni's machine] (it) Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia Leonardo Da Vinci. Retrieved 2010-10-04&lt;/ref&gt; he destroyed it after hearing that Antonius Braun had received 10,000 [[Rhenish guilder|Gulden]]s for dedicating a pinwheel machine of his own design to the emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p. 93-94 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1725, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] certified a calculating machine derived from Pascal's calculator designed by Lépine, a French craftsman. The machine was a bridge in between Pascal's calculator and a calculating clock. The carry transmissions were performed simultaneously, like in a calculating clock, and therefore "the machine must have jammed beyond a few simultaneous carry transmissions".&lt;ref&gt;translated from the French: "De plus le report ne s'effectuant pas en cascade, la machine devait se bloquer au-delà de quelques reports simultanés", [[#MARG|Jean Marguin]], p.78 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1727, a German, [[Antonius Braun]], presented the first fully functional four operations machine to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[Vienna]]. It was cylindrical in shape and was made of steel, silver and brass; it was finely decorated and looked like a renaissance table clock. His dedication to the emperor engraved on the top of the machine also reads "..to make easy to ignorant people, addition, subtraction, multiplication and even division".&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p.94-96 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1730, the French Academy of Sciences certified three machines designed by [[Hillerin de Boistissandeau]]. The first one used a single tooth carry mechanism which, according to Boistissandeau, wouldn't work properly if a carry had to be moved more than two places; the two other machines used springs that were gradually armed until they released their energy when a carry had to be moved forward. It was similar to Pascal's calculator but instead of using the energy of gravity Boistissandeau used the energy stored into the springs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG, Jean Marguin]], pages 80-81 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1770, [[Philipp Matthäus Hahn]], a German pastor, built two circular calculating machines based on Leibniz' cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGIN|Marguin, p.83 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/attic/attic_137.html Picture of Hahn's Calculator] IBM Collection of mechanical calculators&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. C. Schuster]], Hahn's brother in law, built a few machines of Hahn's design into the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGIN|Jean Marguin, pages 84-86 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1775, [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] of the [[United Kingdom]] designed a pinwheel machine. It was set in a rectangular box with a handle on the side. He also designed a machine using [[Leibniz wheel]]s in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FELT|Door E. Felt, p.15-16 (1916)]]&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1777 Stanhope produced the ''Logic Demonstrator,'' a machine designed to solve problems in formal logic. This device marked the beginning of a new approach to the solution of logical problems by mechanical methods."&lt;ref name="Chronicle, p. 12"/&gt;
* In 1784, [[J. H. Müller|Johann-Helfrich Müller]] built a machine very similar to Hahn's machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?8KU54-2.5/253/150/369/363/369|title=CNUM - 8KU54-2.5 : p.249 - im.253|website=cnum.cnam.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
{{anchor|TotalMachinesBuilt}}
[[Luigi Torchi (inventor)| Luigi Torchi]] invented the first direct multiplication machine in [[1834]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/19thCentury/Torchi.html|title=History of Computers and Computing, Mechanical calculators, 19th century, Luiggi Torchi|website=history-computer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White ([[1822]])&lt;ref name="Roegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7763737|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The mechanical calculator industry started in 1851  [[Thomas de Colmar]] released his simplified [[Arithmometer|Arithmomètre]] which was the first machine that could be used daily in an office environment.

For 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;This is one third of the 120 years that this industry lasted&lt;/ref&gt; the arithmometer was the only mechanical calculator available for sale and was sold all over the world. By then, in 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html|title=www.arithmometre.org|website=www.arithmometre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus a few hundreds more from two licensed arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883). Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 comptometers in three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=4|year=1916|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century also saw the designs of Charles Babbage calculating machines, first with his [[difference engine]], started in 1822, which was the first automatic calculator since it continuously used the results of the previous operation for the next one, and second with his [[analytical engine]], which was the first programmable calculator, using Jacquard's cards to read program and data, that he started in 1834, and which gave the blueprint of the [[mainframe computers]] built in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BABBAGE&gt;"The calculating engines of English mathematician Charles Babbage (1791-1871) are among the most celebrated icons in the prehistory of computing. Babbage’s Difference Engine No.1 was the first successful automatic calculator and remains one of the finest examples of precision engineering of the time. Babbage is sometimes referred to as "father of computing." The International Charles Babbage Society (later the Charles Babbage Institute) took his name to honor his intellectual contributions and their relation to modern computers."

===Desktop calculators produced===
[[Image:Close-up of the front panel of a Thomas Arithmometer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Front panel of a Thomas Arithmometer with its movable result carriage extended]]
* In 1851, [[Thomas de Colmar]] simplified his [[arithmometer]] by removing the one digit multiplier/divider. This made it a simple adding machine, but thanks to its moving carriage used as an indexed accumulator, it still allowed for easy multiplication and division under operator control. The arithmometer was now adapted to the manufacturing capabilities of the time; Thomas could therefore manufacture consistently a sturdy and reliable machine.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah G., ''The Universal History of Numbers'', vol 3, page 127, The Harvill Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Manuals were printed and each machine was given a serial number. Its commercialization launched the mechanical calculator industry.&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;Chase G.C.: ''History of Mechanical Computing Machinery'', Vol. 2, Number 3, July 1980, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;  Banks, insurance companies, government offices started to use the arithmometer in their day-to-day operations, slowly bringing mechanical desktop calculators into the office.
* In 1878 Burkhardt, of Germany, was the first to manufacture a clone of Thomas' arithmometer. Until then Thomas de Colmar had been the only manufacturer of desktop mechanical calculators in the world and he had manufactured about 1,500 machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSerieEnglish.html Serial numbers and Years of manufacturing] www.arithmometre.org, Valéry Monnier&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually twenty European companies will manufacture clones of thomas' arithmometer until WWII.
* [[Dorr E. Felt]], in the U.S., patented the [[Comptometer]] in 1886. It was the first successful key-driven adding and calculating machine. ["Key-driven" refers to the fact that just pressing the keys causes the result to be calculated, no separate lever or crank has to be operated. Other machines are sometimes called "key-set".] In 1887, he joined with Robert Tarrant to form the Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.V. Turck, ''Origin of modern calculating machines'', The Western Society of Engineers, 1921, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  The comptometer-type calculator was the first machine to receive an all-electronic calculator engine in 1961 (the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA mark VII]] released by Sumlock comptometer of the UK).
* In 1890 [[Viligodt Teofil Odner|W. T. Odhner]] got the rights to manufacture his calculator back from ''Königsberger &amp; C'', which had held them since it was first patented in 1878, but had not really produced anything. Odhner used his [[Saint Petersburg]] workshop to manufacture his calculator and he built and sold 500 machines in 1890. This manufacturing operation shut down definitively in 1918 with 23,000 machines produced. The [[Odhner Arithmometer]] was a redesigned version of the Arithmometer of Thomas de Colmar with a pinwheel engine, which made it cheaper to manufacture and gave it a smaller footprint while keeping the advantage of having the same user interface.&lt;ref name="Trogemann"&gt;[[#TROG|G. Trogemann]], pages: 39-45&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1892 Odhner sold the Berlin branch of his factory, which he had opened a year earlier, to ''Grimme, Natalis &amp; Co.''. They moved the factory to Braunschweig and sold their machines under the brand name of Brunsviga (Brunsviga is the Latin name of the town of Braunschweig).&lt;ref&gt;David J. Shaw: ''The Cathedral Libraries Catalogue'', The British Library and the Bibliographical Society, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first of many companies which would sell and manufacture clones of Odhner's machine all over the world; eventually millions were sold well into the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Trogemann"/&gt;
* In 1892, [[William Seward Burroughs I|William S. Burroughs]] began commercial manufacture of his printing adding calculator&lt;ref&gt;J.A.V. Turck, ''Origin of modern calculating machines'', The Western Society of Engineers, 1921, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burroughs Corporation]] became one of the leading companies in the accounting machine and [[computer]] businesses.
* [[The Millionaire Calculator|The "Millionaire"]] calculator was introduced in 1893. It allowed direct multiplication by any digit - "one turn of the crank for each figure in the multiplier". It contained a mechanical product lookup table, providing units and tens digits by differing lengths of posts.  [http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/Millionaire/Intro.htm] Another direct multiplier was part of the Moon-Hopkins billing machine; that company was acquired by Burroughs in the early 20th century.

=== Automatic mechanical calculators ===
[[Image:050114 2529 difference.jpg|thumb|The London Science Museum's working difference engine, built a century and a half after Charles Babbage's design.]]
* In 1822, [[Charles Babbage]] presented a small cogwheel assembly that demonstrated the operation of his [[difference engine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#WEB|James Essinger]], p.76 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanical calculator which would be capable of holding and manipulating seven numbers of 31 decimal digits each. It was the first time that a calculating machine could work automatically using as input results from its previous operations.&lt;ref name=BABBAGE/&gt;  It was the first calculating machine to use a printer. The development of this machine, later called "Difference Engine No. 1," stopped around 1834.&lt;ref&gt;"The better part of my live has now been spent on that machine, and no progress whatever having been made since 1834...", Charles Babbage, quoted in [[#GENIUS|Irascible Genius]], 1964, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1847, Babbage began work on an improved difference engine design—his "Difference Engine No. 2."  None of these designs were completely built by Babbage. In 1991 the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]] followed Babbage's plans to build a working Difference Engine No. 2 using the technology and materials available in the 19th century.
* In 1855, [[Per Georg Scheutz]] completed a working difference engine based on Babbage's design. The machine was the size of a piano, and was demonstrated at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in [[Paris]] in 1855. It was used to create tables of [[logarithm]]s.
* In 1875, [[Martin Wiberg]] re-designed the Babbage/Scheutz difference engine and built a version that was the size of a sewing machine.

=== Programmable mechanical calculators ===
[[File:Analytical Engine (2290032530).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.6|Minimal but working demonstration part of the ''mill'' from the [[Analytical engine]], finished by Babbage's son around 1906]]
* In 1834, Babbage started to design his [[analytical engine]], which will become the undisputed ancestor of the modern [[mainframe computer]]&lt;ref&gt;"It is reasonable to inquire, therefore, whether it is possible to devise a machine which will do for mathematical computation what the [[automatic lathe]] has done for engineering. The first suggestion that such a machine could be made came more than a hundred years ago from the mathematician Charles Babbage. Babbage's ideas have only been properly appreciated in the last ten years, but we now realize that he understood clearly all the fundamental principles which are embodied in modern digital computers" [[#FASTER|B. V. Bowden]], 1953, pp. 6,7&lt;/ref&gt; with two separate input streams for data and program (a primitive [[Harvard architecture]]), printers for outputting results (three different kind), processing unit (mill), memory (store) and the first ever set of programming instructions. In the proposal that [[Howard Aiken]] gave [[IBM]] in 1937 while requesting funding for the [[Harvard Mark I]] which became IBM's entry machine in the computer industry, we can read: "Few calculating machines have been designed strictly for application to scientific investigations, the notable exceptions being those of Charles Babbage and others who followed him. In 1812 Babbage conceived the idea of a calculating machine of a higher type than those previously constructed to be used for calculating and printing tables of mathematical functions. ....After abandoning the ''difference engine'', Babbage devoted his energy to the design and construction of an ''analytical engine'' of far higher powers than the ''difference engine''..."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Aiken, 1937, reprinted in [[#ORIGINS|The origins of Digital computers, Selected Papers]], Edited by [[Brian Randell]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the analytical engine, [[Ada Lovelace]] wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the [[Bernoulli numbers]].  This is considered the first computer program.
* From 1872 until 1910, [[Henry Babbage]] worked intermittently on creating the mill, the "central processing unit" of his father's machine.  After a few setbacks, he gave in 1906 a successful demonstration of the mill which printed the first 44 multiples of pi with 29 places of figures.

=== Cash registers ===
{{further|Cash registers}}
The cash register, invented by the American saloonkeeper [[James Ritty]] in 1879, addressed the old problems of disorganization and dishonesty in business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.org.uk/page106.html NCR Retrospective website] accessed October, 02 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a pure adding machine coupled with a [[printer (computing)|printer]], a bell and a two-sided display that showed the paying party and the store owner, if he wanted to, the amount of money exchanged for the current transaction.

The cash register was easy to use and, unlike genuine mechanical calculators, was needed and quickly adopted by a great number of businesses.  "Eighty four companies sold cash registers between 1888 and 1895, only three survived for any length of time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cashregistersonline.com/history.asp History of the cash register] retrieved October, 05 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, 6 years after [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)|John Patterson]] started [[NCR Corporation]], 20,000 machines had been sold by his company alone against a total of roughly 3,500 for all genuine calculators combined.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TotalMachinesBuilt|See the number of machines built in 1890]] in this paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, NCR had built 200,000 cash registers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasscashregister.net/learn_more/articles/how_to_date_your_national_or_ncr_cash_register/ Dick and Joan's antique] accessed October, 02 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and there were more companies manufacturing them, compared to the "Thomas/Payen" arithmometer company that had just sold around 3,300&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html List of serial numbers by dates] arithmometre.org retrieved October 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Burroughs had only sold 1,400 machines.&lt;ref&gt;Before the computer, James W. Cortada, p.34 {{ISBN|0-691-04807-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prototypes and limited runs===
[[File:Arithmometer - Detail of Multiplier pre 1851.jpg|right|thumb|center|&lt;div align="center"&gt;The arithmometers built from 1820 to 1851 had a one digit multiplier/divider cursor (ivory top) is on the left. Only prototypes of these machines were built.&lt;/div&gt;]]
* In 1820, [[Thomas de Colmar]] patented the Arithmometer. It was a true four operation machine with a one digit multiplier/divider ([[The Millionaire Calculator|the millionaire calculator]] released 70 years later had a similar user interface&lt;ref&gt;A notable difference was that the Millionaire calculator used an internal mechanical product lookup table versus a repeated addition or subtraction ''until a counter was decreased down to zero and stopped the machine'' for the arithmometer&lt;/ref&gt;). He spent the next 30 years and 300,000 Francs developing his machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/Bibliotheque/BibNumerique/AmiDesSciences1856/AmidesSciences1856.pdf L'ami des Sciences 1856, p. 301] www.arithmometre.org (page retrieved on 09/22/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  This design was replaced in 1851 by the simplified arithmometer which was only an adding machine.
* From 1840, Didier Roth patented and built a few calculating machines, one of which was a direct descendant of [[Pascal's calculator]].

Although Grant never made much money from his calculating machines, his experiences in designing and constructing them led him to establish the highly successful ''Grant Gear Works'', which helped to pioneer the gear-cutting industry in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; The machine measured 13x5x7 inches and contained eighty working pieces made of brass and tempered steel.

=== Mechanical calculators reach their zenith ===
Two different classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations took place on the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.

The latter, type, rotary, had at least one main shaft that made one [or more] continuous revolution[s], one addition or subtraction per turn. Numerous designs, notably European calculators, had handcranks, and locks to ensure that the cranks were returned to exact positions once a turn was complete.

[[Image:Mechanical-Calculator.png|thumb|right|Mechanical calculator from 1914]]
The first half of the 20th century saw the gradual development of the mechanical calculator mechanism.

The Dalton adding-listing [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Addizionatrice_Dalton.jpg machine] introduced in 1902 was the first of its type to use only ten keys, and became the first of many different models of "10-key add-listers" manufactured by many companies.
[[File:Modern Addiator.jpg|thumb|left|100px|An [[Addiator]] can be used for addition and subtraction.]]
In 1948 the cylindrical [[Curta]] calculator, which was compact enough to be held in one hand, was introduced after being developed by [[Curt Herzstark]] in 1938. This was an extreme development of the stepped-gear calculating mechanism. It subtracted by adding complements; between the teeth for addition were teeth for subtraction.

From the early 1900s through the 1960s, mechanical calculators dominated the desktop computing market. Major suppliers in the USA included [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]], [[Monroe Calculator Company|Monroe]], and [[Marchant Calculator|SCM/Marchant]]. These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were ''full'' — each digit that could be entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.) One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical adding machines, and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, as well as some rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as [[Olivetti]], did make printing calculators.

In these machines, [[addition]] and [[subtraction]] were performed in a single operation, as on a conventional adding machine, but [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] were accomplished by repeated mechanical additions and subtractions. [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] made a calculator that also provided [[square root]]s, basically by doing division, but with added mechanism that automatically incremented the number in the keyboard in a systematic fashion. The last of the mechanical calculators were likely to have short-cut multiplication, and some ten-key, serial-entry types had decimal-point keys. However, decimal-point keys required significant internal added complexity, and were offered only in the last designs to be made. Handheld mechanical calculators such as the 1948 [[Curta]] continued to be used until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.

Typical European four-operation machines use the Odhner mechanism, or variations of it. This kind of machine included the ''Original Odhner'', Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although most of these were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the setting lever positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.

Although Dalton introduced in 1902 first ten-key printing ''adding'' (two operations, the other being subtraction) machine, these feature were not present in ''computing'' (four operations) machines for many decades. Facit-T (1932) was the first 10-key computing machine sold in large numbers. [[Olivetti]] Divisumma-14 (1948) was the first computing machine with both printer and a 10-key keyboard.

Full-keyboard machines, including motor-driven ones, were also built until the 1960s. Among the major manufacturers were Mercedes-Euklid, Archimedes, and MADAS in Europe; &lt;!--Need more makers! --&gt;in the USA, Friden, Marchant, and Monroe were the principal makers of rotary calculators with carriages. Reciprocating calculators (most of which were adding machines, many with integral printers) were made by Remington Rand and Burroughs, among others. All of these were key-set. Felt &amp; Tarrant made Comptometers, as well as Victor, which were key-driven.

The basic mechanism of the Friden and Monroe was a modified Leibniz wheel (better known, perhaps informally, in the USA as a "stepped drum" or "stepped reckoner"). The Friden had an elementary reversing drive between the body of the machine and the accumulator dials, so its main shaft always rotated in the same direction. The Swiss MADAS was similar. The Monroe, however, reversed direction of its main shaft to subtract.

The earliest Marchants were pinwheel machines, but most of them were remarkably-sophisticated rotary types. They ran at 1,300 addition cycles per minute if the [+] bar is held down. Others were limited to 600 cycles per minute, because their accumulator dials started and stopped for every cycle; Marchant dials moved at a steady and proportional speed for continuing cycles. Most Marchants had a row of nine keys on the extreme right, as shown in the photo of the Figurematic. These simply made the machine add for the number of cycles corresponding to the number on the key, and then shifted the carriage one place. Even nine add cycles took only a short time.

In a Marchant, near the beginning of a cycle, the accumulator dials moved downward "into the dip", away from the openings in the cover. They engaged drive gears in the body of the machine, which rotated them at speeds proportional to the digit being fed to them, with added movement (reduced 10:1) from carries created by dials to their right. At the completion of the cycle, the dials would be misaligned like the pointers in a traditional watt-hour meter. However, as they came up out of the dip, a constant-lead disc cam realigned them by way of a (limited-travel) spur-gear differential. As well, carries for lower orders were added in by another, planetary differential. (The machine shown has 39 differentials in its (20-digit) accumulator!)

In any mechanical calculator, in effect, a gear, sector, or some similar device moves the accumulator by the number of gear teeth that corresponds to the digit being added or subtracted – three teeth changes the position by a count of three. The great majority of basic calculator mechanisms move the accumulator by starting, then moving at a constant speed, and stopping. In particular, stopping is critical, because to obtain fast operation, the accumulator needs to move quickly. Variants of Geneva drives typically block overshoot (which, of course, would create wrong results).

However, two different basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds corresponding to the digit being added or subtracted; a [1] moves the accumulator the slowest, and a [9], the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks ("straight gears") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever's pivot. Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot. The rack for [1] is closest to the pivot, of course.
For each keyboard digit, a sliding selector gear, much like that in the Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.

The Marchant, however, has, for every one of its ten columns of keys, a nine-ratio "preselector transmission" with its output spur gear at the top of the machine's body; that gear engages the accumulator gearing. When one tries to work out the numbers of teeth in such a transmission, a straightforward approach leads one to consider a mechanism like that in mechanical gasoline pump registers, used to indicate the total price. However, this mechanism is seriously bulky, and utterly impractical for a calculator; 90-tooth gears are likely to be found in the gas pump. Practical gears in the computing parts of a calculator cannot have 90 teeth. They would be either too big, or too delicate.

Given that nine ratios per column implies significant complexity, a Marchant contains a few hundred individual gears in all, many in its accumulator. Basically, the accumulator dial has to rotate 36 degrees (1/10 of a turn) for a [1], and 324 degrees (9/10 of a turn) for a [9], not allowing for incoming carries. At some point in the gearing, one tooth needs to pass for a [1], and nine teeth for a [9]. There is no way to develop the needed movement from a driveshaft that rotates one revolution per cycle with few gears having practical (relatively small) numbers of teeth.

The Marchant, therefore, has three driveshafts to feed the little transmissions. For one cycle, they rotate 1/2, 1/4, and 1/12 of a revolution. [http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/MarchantDRX/Actuator.htm]. The 1/2-turn shaft carries (for each column) gears with 12, 14, 16, and 18 teeth, corresponding to digits 6, 7, 8, and 9. The 1/4-turn shaft carries (also, each column) gears with 12, 16, and 20 teeth, for 3, 4, and 5. Digits [1] and [2] are handled by 12 and 24-tooth gears on the 1/12-revolution shaft. Practical design places the 12th-rev. shaft more distant, so the 1/4-turn shaft carries freely-rotating 24 and 12-tooth idler gears. For subtraction, the driveshafts reversed direction.

In the early part of the cycle, one of five pendants moves off-center to engage the appropriate drive gear for the selected digit.

Some machines had as many as 20 columns in their full keyboards. The monster in this field was the ''Duodecillion'' made by [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] for exhibit purposes.

For sterling currency, £/s/d (and even farthings), there were variations of the basic mechanisms, in particular with different numbers of gear teeth and accumulator dial positions. To accommodate shillings and pence, extra columns were added for the tens digit[s], 10 and 20 for shillings, and 10 for pence. Of course, these functioned as radix-20 and radix-12 mechanisms.

A variant of the Marchant, called the Binary-Octal Marchant, was a radix-8 (octal) machine. It was sold to check very early vacuum-tube (valve) binary computers for accuracy. (Back then, the mechanical calculator was much more reliable than a tube/valve computer.)

As well, there was a twin Marchant, comprising two pinwheel Marchants with a common drive crank and reversing gearbox.[http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/the_twin_marchant.html] Twin machines were relatively rare, and apparently were used for surveying calculations. At least one triple machine was made.

The Facit calculator, and one similar to it, are basically pinwheel machines, but the array of pinwheels moves sidewise, instead of the carriage. The pinwheels are biquinary; digits 1 through 4 cause the corresponding number of sliding pins to  extend from the surface; digits 5 through 9 also extend a five-tooth sector as well as the same pins for 6 through 9.

The keys operate cams that operate a swinging lever to first unlock the pin-positioning cam that is part of the pinwheel mechanism; further movement of the lever (by an amount determined by the key's cam) rotates the pin-positioning cam to extend the necessary number of pins.[http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/FacitC1-13/C113.htm#Rotor]

Stylus-operated adders with circular slots for the stylus, and side-by -side wheels, as made by Sterling Plastics (USA), had an ingenious anti-overshoot mechanism to ensure accurate carries.

=== The end of an era ===
Mechanical calculators continued to be sold, though in rapidly decreasing numbers, into the early 1970s, with many of the manufacturers closing down or being taken over. [[Comptometer]] type calculators were often retained for much longer to be used for adding and listing duties, especially in accounting, since a trained and skilled operator could enter all the digits of a number in one movement of the hands on a [[Comptometer]] quicker than was possible serially with a 10-key electronic calculator. In fact, it was quicker to enter larger digits in two strokes using only the lower-numbered keys; for instance, a 9 would be entered as 4 followed by 5. Some key-driven calculators had keys for every column, but only 1 through 5; they were correspondingly compact. The spread of the computer rather than the simple electronic calculator put an end to the [[Comptometer]]. Also, by the end of the 1970s, the [[slide rule]] had become obsolete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2769">In [[size theory]], the '''natural pseudodistance''' between two [[size pair]]s &lt;math&gt;(M,\varphi:M\to \mathbb{R})\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(N,\psi:N\to \mathbb{R})\ &lt;/math&gt; is the value &lt;math&gt;\inf_h \|\varphi-\psi\circ h\|_\infty\ &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h\ &lt;/math&gt; varies in the set of all [[homeomorphism]]s from the manifold &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; to the manifold &lt;math&gt;N\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_\infty\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[supremum norm]]. If &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\ &lt;/math&gt; are not homeomorphic, then the natural pseudodistance is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\infty\ &lt;/math&gt;.
It is usually assumed that &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N\ &lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;C^1\ &lt;/math&gt; [[closed manifold]]s and the [[measuring function]]s &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi\ &lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;C^1\ &lt;/math&gt;. Put another way, the natural pseudodistance  measures the infimum of the change of the measuring function induced by the homeomorphisms from &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N\ &lt;/math&gt;.

The concept of natural pseudodistance can be easily extended to [[size pair]]s where the measuring function &lt;math&gt;\varphi\ &lt;/math&gt; takes values in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m\ &lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;ref name="FroMu99"&gt;Patrizio Frosini, Michele Mulazzani, ''Size homotopy groups for computation of natural size distances'', [[Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society]], 6:455-464, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main properties==
It can be proved &lt;ref name="DoFro04"&gt;Pietro Donatini, Patrizio Frosini, ''Natural pseudodistances between closed manifolds'', Forum Mathematicum, 16(5):695-715, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
that the natural pseudodistance always equals the Euclidean distance between two critical values of the measuring functions (possibly, of the ''same'' measuring function) divided by a suitable positive integer &lt;math&gt;k\ &lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\ &lt;/math&gt; are surfaces, the number &lt;math&gt;k\ &lt;/math&gt; can be assumed to be &lt;math&gt;1\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2\ &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;3\ &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pietro Donatini, Patrizio Frosini, ''Natural pseudodistances between closed surfaces'',
Journal of the European Mathematical Society, 9(2):231–253, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\ &lt;/math&gt; are curves, the number &lt;math&gt;k\ &lt;/math&gt; can be assumed to be &lt;math&gt;1\ &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2\ &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pietro Donatini, Patrizio Frosini, ''Natural pseudodistances between closed curves'', Forum Mathematicum, 21(6):981–999, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
If an optimal homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;\bar h\ &lt;/math&gt; exists (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\|\varphi-\psi\circ \bar h\|_\infty=\inf_h \|\varphi-\psi\circ h\|_\infty\ &lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;k\ &lt;/math&gt; can be assumed to be &lt;math&gt;1\ &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="DoFro04"/&gt;

[[File:Nearest integer.svg|thumb|300px|A plot of the nearest integer function, rounding to the nearest even integer]]
In [[computer science]], the '''nearest integer function''' of [[real number]] ''x'' denoted variously by &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | title=Nearest Integer Function | urlname=NearestIntegerFunction | accessdate= 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Vert x \Vert&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.W.S. Cassels|title=An introduction to Diophantine approximation|series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics and Mathematical Physics|volume=45|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1957|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; nint(''x''), or Round(''x''), is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which returns the nearest [[integer]] to ''x''.  To avoid ambiguity when operating on [[half-integer]]s, a [[rounding]] rule must be chosen.  On most computer implementations{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}, the selected rule is to round half-integers to the nearest [[even number|even integer]]—for example, 
:&lt;math&gt;[1.25] = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[1.50] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[1.75] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.25] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.50] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.75] = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.25] = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.50] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.75] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[4.50] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:etc.
This is in accordance with the [[IEEE 754]] standards and helps reduce bias in the result.

There are many other possible rules for [[rounding#Tie-breaking|tie breaking]] when rounding a half integer include rounding up, rounding down, rounding to or away from zero, or random rounding up or down.

The '''Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics''' is a [[Braille code]] for encoding mathematical and scientific notation linearly using standard six-dot [[Braille cell]]s for tactile reading by the visually impaired. The code was developed by [[Abraham Nemeth]]. The Nemeth Code was first written up in 1952. It was revised in 1956, 1965, and 1972,&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Nemeth Code|url=http://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/fr/fr28/fr280110.htm|accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beginning in 1992 was integrated into [[Unified English Braille]]. It is an example of a compact human-readable [[markup language]].

Nemeth Braille is just one code used to write mathematics in braille. There are many systems in use around the world.&lt;ref name=world&gt;{{cite web|title=Braille Mathematical Notations|url=http://chezdom.net/blog/?page_id=51|accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles of the Nemeth Code ==
The Nemeth Code Book (1972) opens with the following words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation has been prepared to provide a system of symbols which will allow technical literature to be presented and read in braille. The Code is intended to convey as accurate an impression as is possible to the braille reader of the corresponding printed text, and this is one of its principal features. When the braille reader has a clear conception of the corresponding printed text, the area of communication between himself and his teacher, his colleagues, his associates, and the world at large is greatly broadened. ''A test of the accuracy with which the Code conveys information from the print to the braille text is to effect a transcription in the reverse direction. The amount of agreement between the original printed text and one transcribed from the braille is a measure of the Code's accuracy''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name=codebook&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation 1972 Revision |url=http://www.brailleauthority.org/mathscience/nemeth1972.pdf |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence is that the braille transcriber does not need to know the underlying mathematics.
The braille transcriber needs to identify the inkprint symbols and know how to render them in
Nemeth Code braille. For example, if the same math symbol might have two different meanings, this would
not matter; both instances would be brailled the same. This is in contrast to the International
Braille Music Code, where the braille depends on the meaning of the inkprint music. Thus a knowledge of
music is required to produce braille music.

'''''Numbers''''' (stylized as '''''NUMB3RS''''')  is an American [[crime drama]] [[television series]] that ran on [[CBS]] from January 23, 2005, to March 12, 2010. The series was created by [[Nicolas Falacci]] and [[Cheryl Heuton]], and follows [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Special Agent]] [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]) and his brother [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]), a college mathematics professor and prodigy who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers [[Ridley Scott|Ridley]] and [[Tony Scott]] produced ''Numbers''; its production companies are the Scott brothers' [[Scott Free Productions]] and [[CBS Television Studios]] (originally [[Paramount Network Television]], and later [[CBS Paramount Network Television]]).

The show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and [[Mathematical modeling|mathematically modeled]] by Charlie, with the help of [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) and [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.

On May 18, 2010, CBS announced that ''Numbers'' had been canceled after six seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/report-cbs-cancels-ghost-whisperer-numbers-and-five-more-shows.html "Report: CBS cancels 'Ghost Whisperer,' 'Numbers' and five more shows"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111044100/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/report-cbs-cancels-ghost-whisperer-numbers-and-five-more-shows.html |date=2010-11-11 }}. [[Zap2It]] May 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of Numbers characters}}
The show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.

* [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]), Charlie's older brother, is the lead [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]] at the Los Angeles Violent Crimes Squad.
* [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]) is a [[mathematician|mathematical genius]] who, in addition to teaching at CalSci, consults for the FBI and [[National Security Agency|NSA]].
* [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]) is a former [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] [[Urban planner|city planner]], a widower, and the father of both Charlie and Don Eppes. Alan lives in a historic two-story house (filmed at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/2515+4th+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90018/@34.034002,-118.3238247,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80c2b869ec3fde99:0x627e93a3a95a80da 2525 4th Avenue]) furnished with period [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] furniture.
* [[David Sinclair (Numbers)|David Sinclair]] ([[Alimi Ballard]]) is an FBI [[field agent]] and was later made Don's second-in-command and promoted to supervisor.
* Terry Lake ([[Sabrina Lloyd]]) is a forensic psychologist and FBI agent.
* Prof. [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) is a [[theoretical physicist]] and [[cosmologist]] at CalSci. Charlie's former mentor and now best friend, he also frequently consults for the FBI.
* Prof. [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]) is a mathematician at CalSci and an FBI consultant. In season&amp;nbsp;2, she begins dating Charlie, to whom she is engaged and married in season&amp;nbsp;6. Charlie was her [[thesis advisor]]. Her name is a reference to influential autodidactic Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].
* [[Megan Reeves]] ([[Diane Farr]]) is an FBI [[behaviorist|behavioral specialist]]. She was involved romantically with Larry Fleinhardt and left the FBI to counsel troubled young women.
* [[Colby Granger]] ([[Dylan Bruno]]) is an FBI field agent. Once thought to have betrayed his colleagues, he is now back in their good graces and confidence.
* [[Liz Warner]] ([[Aya Sumika]]) is an FBI agent, formerly involved with Agent Eppes.
* [[Nikki Betancourt]] ([[Sophina Brown]]) is an FBI agent with four years' experience in the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and a [[Juris Doctor|law degree]].

Temporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode "[[List of Numbers episodes|In Plain Sight]]" (season&amp;nbsp;2, episode&amp;nbsp;8), one of the criminals is named [[Michel Rolle|Rolle]] and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named [[Julius Petersen|Robert Peterson]].

{{Main|List of Numbers episodes}}

'''Opening:''' (Voice-over by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weather…to tell time…to handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. It’s logic; it’s rationality. It’s using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.

===Season 1 (2005)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 1)}}
The first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' [[List of FBI field offices#California|FBI field office]] and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and [[List of Numbers characters#Terry Lake|Terry Lake]], as well as [[List of Numbers characters#David Sinclair|David Sinclair]]. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student [[Amita Ramanujan]] provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. [[Sabrina Lloyd]] played Terry Lake, an agent, in this season; she was later replaced by [[Diane Farr]], who played Megan Reeves.

===Season 2 (2005–06)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 2)}}
The second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: [[Megan Reeves (Numb3rs)|Megan Reeves]] and [[Colby Granger]]. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at [[Harvard University]], but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.

===Season 3 (2006–07)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 3)}}
''Numb3rs'' was renewed for a third season,&lt;ref name="season3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tv.com/numb3rs/show/25043/story.html?story_id=3543&amp;tag=headlines;title;1 |title=Voila! CBS renews 14 shows at once |last=Mahan |first=Colin |publisher=TV.com |date=March 6, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began airing at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Friday, September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his [[leave of absence]]—he will be on the [[International Space Station]] for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his [[ethics]] and [[self-worth]], and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.

Noticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', but returned to ''Numbers'' for the 21st episode of season&amp;nbsp;3 ("[[The Art of Reckoning (Numb3rs)|The Art of Reckoning]]"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a [[Payload Specialist]] on the [[International Space Station]]. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for [[maternity leave]] in episode 18 ("[[Democracy (Numb3rs)|Democracy]]"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

===Season 4 (2007–08)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 4)}}
The season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time]].&lt;ref name="fall2007preview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/fall_preview_2007/ |title=CBS 2007 Fall Preview |accessdate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|writer's strike]], only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cbsreturndates,0,7656374.story |title=CBS Sets Series Return Dates |accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ended on May 16, 2008.

As this season starts, [[Colby Granger]] escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a [[triple agent]]. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season&amp;nbsp;2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends [[FBI Academy|FBI training camp]] because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to [[Washington, D.C.]], and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in [[Pakistan]]. He is subsequently arrested and has his [[security clearance]] revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.

Several characters from previous seasons did not appear in season&amp;nbsp;4, most notably [[Mildred Finch]] and [[Ian Edgerton]].

===Season 5 (2008–09)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 5)}}
The fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009. The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|2008 presidential debates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/114334-CBS_Sets_Fall_Premiere_Dates.php |title=CBS Sets Fall Premiere Dates |publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Media |accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season five opens three weeks after "[[When Worlds Collide (Numbers)|When Worlds Collide]]" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his [[security clearance]] back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore [[Judaism]]. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Robin is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, [[Spree (Numbers)|"Spree"]] and "[[Two Daughters]]") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. [[DARPA]] tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is left unidentified.

Notes about Season Five:
[[Disturbed (Numbers)|"Disturbed"]] marked the 100th episode of ''Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/05/01/2009-05-01_hawking_counts_numb3rs_as_a_fave.html |title=Hawking counts 'Numb3rs' as a fave |accessdate=September 9, 2009 |last=Kinon |first=Cristina |date=May 1, 2009 |publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 6 (2009–10)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 6)}}
The sixth and final season premiered Friday, September 25, 2009, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-CBS-premieres-1007227.aspx |title=Fall TV: CBS Announces Premiere Dates |publisher=TVGuide.com |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010, 3 days before Hirsch's 75th birthday.

The season starts with the [[engagement]] of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at [[CERN]], in [[Geneva]], and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his [[401(k)]]. After some delay, Larry leaves [[Los Angeles]], only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI. Larry returns from the desert with a new theory about the universe's fate. Charlie and Amita begin planning their wedding and decide to join the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brother/Big Sister]] program to practice parenting skills. They get married before their move to [[England]] to teach at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Don loses his gun, recovers it after it is used in some [[vigilante]] murders, and gets engaged to Robin. He also decides to leave the team, taking an administrative position within the FBI. Before leaving, Charlie and Amita decide that the family garage should be converted to a [[guest house]] so Alan can continue living with them. Leaving Colby, Liz, and Nikki behind, David departs for [[Washington, D.C.]], to take a position as an anti-corruption team leader.

==Awards and nominations==
[[Nicolas Falacci]] and [[Cheryl Heuton]], the show's creators, have won several awards for the show, including the [[Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science]] in 2006,&lt;ref name="carlsaganaward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/ |title=Official Numb3rs website |accessdate=2006-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Board]]'s Public Service Award in 2007.&lt;ref name="publicserviceaward"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=108701 |title=The "Numb3rs" Add Up: Popular TV Show and Its Creators Receive Public Service Award |publisher=[[National Science Board]] |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the show's [[stunt coordinator]], Jim Vickers, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination|Outstanding Stunt Coordination]] in 2006 for episode 14 of Season&amp;nbsp;2, "[[Harvest (Numbers)|Harvest]]".&lt;ref name="imdb_awards"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/awards |title=Awards for "Numb3rs" |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation of mathematics==
{{cquote|We all use math every day; to predict weather, to tell time, to handle money. Math is more than formulas or equations; it's logic, it's rationality, it's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.}}

Several mathematicians work as [[consultant]]s for each episode.&lt;ref name="wolfram_consultants"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/05/the_mathematica_behind_televis.html?lid=title |title=The Math(ematica) behind Television's Crime Drama NUMB3RS |first=Eric |last=Weisstein |authorlink=Eric Weisstein |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywood_consulting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodmath.com/projects.htm |title=Hollywood Math and Science Film Consulting |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elizabeth |last=Weise |url=http://www.math.caltech.edu/USA%20Today.html |title=They're Calculatingly Cool |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.&lt;ref name="wolfram_consultants" /&gt;&lt;ref name="devlin"&gt;{{cite web |first=Keith |last=Devlin |url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_02_05.html |title=NUMB3RS gets the math right |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mathgames"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ed Jr. |last=Pegg |authorlink=Ed Pegg, Jr. |url=http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_01_21_05.html |title=Math Games – The NUMB3RS TV show |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |date=January 21, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book entitled ''The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics'' ({{isbn|0452288576}}; published August 28, 2007), written by [[Keith Devlin]] and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show along with Dr. Orara, a physics consultant, explain some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.&lt;ref name="devlin_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics (Paperback) |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | ISBN=0-452-28857-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redhawke_books"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redhawke.org/content/view/347/89/ |title=NUMB3RS Books and DVDs |author=Lady Shelley |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the premiere season, the blog edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has commented on the mathematics behind each episode of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/? |title=Numb3rs blog |publisher=Northeastern University |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202040230/http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/ |archivedate=February 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfram Research]] (the developers of ''[[Mathematica]]'') is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled "The math behind ''NUMB3RS''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://numb3rs.wolfram.com |title=NUMB3RS Episode 412-Power-Wolfram Research Math Notes |publisher=Numb3rs.wolfram.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One part-time mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, asserting that the math is inserted after the initial script and written to provide plausible sounding [[jargon]], rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development.&lt;ref name="silverberg"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Silverberg | authorlink = Alice Silverberg
| first = Alice |date=November 2006 |title=Alice in NUMB3Rland |journal=FOCUS |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.math.uci.edu/~asilverb/bibliography/numb3rland.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same part-time consultant offered criticism of the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and expressed concern over the appropriateness of the relationship between [[Charlie Eppes]] and his graduate student [[Amita Ramanujan]].&lt;ref name="silverberg" /&gt;

==Production==
The idea for ''Numbers'' was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by [[Bill Nye]], a popular [[Science education|science educator]].&lt;ref name="nye"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1137661,00.html|title=The Numb3rs Guy |publisher=Time Magazine |date=December 4, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Jonas |first=Gerald|title=The Strange Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/05/bib/971005.rv102432.html | work=The New York Times |date=5 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the "[[Mathnet]]" segment on the children's television show ''[[Square One Television|Square One]]''.

[[Gabriel Macht]] was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes.&lt;ref name="Point of Origin"&gt;{{cite video |people=Cheryl Heuton (co-creator/co-executive producer), Nicolas Falacci (co-creator-executive producer), Ridley Scott (executive producer), Tony Scott (executive producer), David W.

Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech)&lt;ref name="imdb_trivia" /&gt; and the [[University of Southern California]]. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of [[:Image:Millikan Library, Caltech.jpg|Millikan Library]], including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at [[Los Angeles Center Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/locations |title="Numb3rs" (2005) - Filming locations |publisher=Us.imdb.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common location is the [[American Craftsman|Craftsman home]] of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper,&lt;ref name="craftsmanhome"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/17/home/hm-numbers17 |title=Arts and Crafts by the 'Numb3rs' |first=Christy |last=Hobart |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a [[replica]] set was used from the second season onwards.&lt;ref name="setfilming"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fanrush.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=15 |title=NUMB3RS.org forum |accessdate=2007-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title of the show===
The show uses the number three in its title instead of the letter "e".  In interviews with Tom Jicha of the ''[[South Florida Sun Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' and with Alan Pergament of ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', Heuton mentioned that the use of the number three in the title derives from [[leet]], a form of computer jargon that replaces letters with numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jicha|first=Tom|title=Doing the Math – CBS Hopes Its New Equation for the Crime Drama, Pairing a Detective and a Genius, Will Add up to a Hit |newspaper=[[South Florida Sun Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=22 January 2005 | url= http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107C960544014224?p=NewsBank |accessdate=26 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pergament |first=Alan |title='Numb3rs' Viewers Probably Won't Be Willing to Do the Math |newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]] | location=[[Buffalo, New York]]| publisher=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=20 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107C908EC4021785?p=NewsBank |accessdate=27 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Gary Lorden, a [[California Institute of Technology]] mathematics professor who served as the show's mathematics consultant, told [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s Ira Flatow that it was created on a normal computer keyboard.  Lorden also mentioned that the use of the number three in the title can serve as a restriction in Internet searches about the series.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[National Public Radio]] |title=The 'Numb3rs' Don't Lie |work=[[National Public Radio]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=5 October 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=15039360 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both entertainment reporters and psychologists noticed the title's spelling.

Lynette Rice of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' asked Krumholtz about the three in the title; his response was, "Isn't that annoying? I think it should be the mathematical symbol for [[sigma]], which looks like an E. I've been fighting that for weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rice|first=Lynette|title=Smart Throb|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|location=[[New York City, New York]] |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=14 February 2005|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1026706,00.html|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The [[sigma]] (∑) stands for [[summation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=David J. |title=Review of Mathematical Symbols |work=Psy302: Statistical Methods |publisher=[[California State University, Los Angeles]] |date=21 September 2001 |url=http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/dweiss/Psy302/Symbols.htm |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Others used varying adjectives to describe the title.  The TV site [[Zap2it.com]] called it "their typographical silliness, not ours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=dmason |title=CBS is counting on 'Numb3rs' |work=[[Ventura County Star]] |location=[[Camarillo, California]]| publisher=[[Ventura County Star]] |date=4 December 2004 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/1076B5146BD80512?p=NewsBank |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brad Aspey of ''[[The Muskegon Chronicle]]'', stated, "No, that wasn’t an ugly typo you just read - “NUMB3ERS” (pronounced numbers) is the idiosyncratic title of filmmakers Ridley and Tony Scott’s astute and crafty psychological drama which shows that even math can make for edge-of-your-seat entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aspey |first=Brad |title='Regular' TV finally getting the message from cable |work=[[The Muskegon Chronicle]] |location=[[Muskegon, Michigan]] |publisher=[[The Muskegon Chronicle]] |date=28 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11406B3D9777EDE5?p=NewsBank  |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellen Gray of ''[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]'', said, "Some of you may have noticed that in promoting "Numb3rs," which premieres Sunday before moving to its regular 10 p.m. Friday slot, CBS has chosen to put a 3 in place of the "e" in the title….I won't be going along with this particular affectation, which slows down my typing and seems to be the graphic equivalent of the reversed "R" in Toys R Us.

Still others had a more positive view of the title.  When NPR's Flatow asked both Lorden and Dr. Keith Devlin, NPR's mathematics reporter, about the title, both men denied creating the title; Devlin believed that executive producer [[Tony Scott]] originated the title.  Lorden stated that he initially thought that the title was "kind of hokey" but later saw it as "brilliant" and a "catchy logo".&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  Jonathan Storm of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', in his review of the series stated, "You'd think CBS's new Numbers, which premieres at 10 tonight after the Patriots-Steelers football game, is just another one of those shows with numskull titles trying to draw attention to themselves.  But the "3" substituting for the "e" is actually based on a real thing"….  He later said that the show was "written by people familiar with the Dead Cow Cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Storm |first=Jonathan |title=Solving Crimes by the 'Numb3rs' |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=23 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107D72D2F66DE363?p=NewsBank |accessdate=27 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Brooks of ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph (Nashua, NH)]]'' devoted the majority of his entire review to the use of leet in the series title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=David |title=C4n y0u r34d 7h15?

In [[mathematics]] and its applications, a '''parametric family''' or a '''parameterized family''' is a [[indexed family|family]] of objects (a set of related objects) whose differences depend only on the chosen values for a set of [[parameter]]s.

Common examples are parametrized (families of) [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], [[probability  distribution]]s, curves, shapes, etc.

==In probability and its applications==
{{main|Statistical model}}
For example, the probability density function &lt;math&gt; f_X &lt;/math&gt; of a random variable ''X'' may depend on a parameter &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the function may be denoted &lt;math&gt; f_X( \cdot \, ; \theta) &lt;/math&gt; to indicate the dependence on the parameter &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is not a formal argument of the function as it is considered to be fixed. However, each different value of the parameter gives a different probability density function. Then the ''parametric family'' of densities is the set of functions &lt;math&gt; \{ f_X( \cdot \, ; \theta) \mid \theta \in \Theta \} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \Theta&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of all possible values that the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can take. As an example, the [[normal distribution]] is a family of similarly-shaped distributions parametrized by their [[mean]] and their [[variance]].

In [[decision theory]], [[two-moment decision model]]s can be applied when the decision-maker is faced with random variables drawn from a [[location-scale family]] of probability distributions.

==In algebra and its applications==

In [[economics]], the [[Cobb–Douglas production function]] is a family of [[production function]]s parametrized by the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticities]] of output with respect to the various [[factors of production]].

In [[algebra]], the [[quadratic equation]], for example, is actually a family of equations parametrized by the [[coefficient]]s of the variable and of its square and by the [[constant term]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8020">In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], '''Penrose graphical notation''' or '''tensor diagram notation''' is a (usually handwritten) visual depiction of [[multilinear function]]s or [[tensor]]s proposed by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]], "Applications of negative dimensional tensors," in ''Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications'', Academic Press (1971). See Vladimir Turaev, ''Quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds'' (1994), De Gruyter, p. 71 for a brief commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram in the notation consists of several shapes linked together by lines. The notation has been studied extensively by [[Predrag Cvitanović]], who used it to classify the [[classical Lie groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Predrag Cvitanović]] |year=2008 |title=Group Theory: Birdtracks, Lie's, and Exceptional Groups | publisher=Princeton University Press | url=http://birdtracks.eu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been generalized using [[representation theory]] to [[spin network]]s in physics, and with the presence of [[matrix group]]s to [[trace diagram]]s in [[linear algebra]].

== Interpretations ==

=== Multilinear algebra ===

In the language of [[multilinear algebra]], each shape represents a [[multilinear function]]. The lines attached to shapes represent the inputs or outputs of a function, and attaching shapes together in some way is essentially the [[composition of functions]].

=== Tensors ===

In the language of [[tensor|tensor algebra]], a particular tensor is associated with a particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to [[abstract index notation|abstract]] [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|upper and lower]] indices of tensors respectively. Connecting lines between two shapes corresponds to [[tensor contraction|contraction of indices]]. One advantage of this [[Mathematical notation|notation]] is that one does not have to invent new letters for new indices. This notation is also explicitly [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]-independent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]], ''[[The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe]]'', 2005, {{isbn|0-09-944068-7}}, Chapter ''Manifolds of n dimensions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matrices ===
Each shape represents a matrix, and [[tensor product|tensor multiplication]] is done horizontally, and [[matrix multiplication]] is done vertically.

== Representation of special tensors ==

=== Metric tensor ===
The [[metric tensor]] is represented by a U-shaped loop or an upside-down U-shaped loop, depending on the type of tensor that is used.
{|
|[[File:Penrose g.svg|framed|metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose g ab.svg|framed|metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

=== Levi-Civita tensor ===
The [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor]] is represented by a thick horizontal bar with sticks pointing downwards or upwards, depending on the type of tensor that is used.
{|
|valign="top"|[[File:Penrose varepsilon a-n.svg|framed|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ab\ldots n}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|valign="top"|[[File:Penrose epsilon^a-n.svg|framed|&lt;math&gt;\epsilon^{ab\ldots n}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|valign="top"|[[File:Penrose varepsilon a-n epsilon^a-n.svg|framed|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ab\ldots n}\,\epsilon^{ab\ldots n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= n!&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

=== Structure constant ===
&lt;!-- {| 
| --&gt; [[File:Penrose gamma ab^c.svg|thumb|x120px|structure constant &lt;math&gt;{\gamma_{\alpha\beta}}^\chi = -{\gamma_{\beta\alpha}}^\chi&lt;/math&gt;]]
&lt;!-- |[[File:Penrose killing form.svg|thumb|x150px|[[Killing form]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{\alpha\beta}=\kappa_{\beta\alpha}=\gamma_{\alpha\zeta}^{\ \ \xi}\,\gamma_{\beta\xi}^{\ \ \zeta}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}  --&gt;
The structure constants (&lt;math&gt;{\gamma_{ab}}^c&lt;/math&gt;) of a [[Lie algebra]] are represented by a small triangle with one line pointing upwards and two lines pointing downwards.

== Tensor operations ==

=== Contraction of indices ===

[[Tensor contraction|Contraction]] of indices is represented by joining the index lines together.
{|
|[[File:Penrose delta^a b.svg|thumb|x120px|[[Kronecker delta]] &lt;math&gt;\delta^a_b&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose beta a xi^a.svg|thumb|x120px|[[Dot product]] &lt;math&gt;\beta_a\,\xi^a&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose g ab g^bc-d^c a-g^cb g ba.svg|thumb|x120px|&lt;math&gt;g_{ab}\,g^{bc} = \delta_a^c = g^{cb}\,g_{ba}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

=== Symmetrization ===

[[Symmetric tensor|Symmetrization]] of indices is represented by a thick zig-zag or wavy bar crossing the index lines horizontally.
{|
|[[File:Penrose asymmetric Q^a-n.svg|thumb|x120px|Symmetrization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q^{(ab\ldots n)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(with &lt;math&gt;{}_{Q^{ab}=Q^{[ab]}+Q^{(ab)}}&lt;/math&gt;)]]
|}

=== Antisymmetrization ===

[[Antisymmetric tensor|Antisymmetrization]] of indices is represented by a thick straight line crossing the index lines horizontally.
{|
|[[File:Penrose symmetric E a-n.svg|thumb|x120px|Antisymmetrization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;E_{[ab\ldots n]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(with &lt;math&gt;{}_{E_{ab}=E_{[ab]}+E_{(ab)}}&lt;/math&gt;)]]
|}

==Determinant==

The determinant is formed by applying antisymmetrization to the indices.
{|
|[[File:Penrose det T.svg|thumb|x120px|[[Determinant]] &lt;math&gt;\det\mathbf{T} = \det\left(T^a_{\ b}\right)&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose T^-1.svg|thumb|x120px|Inverse of matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{-1} = \left(T^a_{\ b}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

=== Covariant derivative ===

The [[covariant derivative]] (&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;) is represented by a circle around the tensor(s) to be differentiated and a line joined from the circle pointing downwards to represent the lower index of the derivative.
{|
|[[File:Penrose covariant derivate.svg|framed|covariant derivative &lt;math&gt;
12\nabla_a\left( \xi^f\,\lambda^{(d}_{fb[c}\,D^{e)b}_{gh]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= 12\left(  \xi^f (\nabla_a \lambda^{(d}_{fb[c}) \, D^{e)b}_{gh]} + (\nabla_a \xi^f) \lambda^{(d}_{fb[c}\,D^{e)b}_{gh]} + \xi^f \lambda^{(d}_{fb[c} \, (\nabla_a D^{e)b}_{gh]} ) \right)
&lt;/math&gt;]]
|}

== Tensor manipulation ==

The diagrammatic notation is useful in manipulating tensor algebra. It usually involves a few simple "[[Identity (mathematics)|identities]]" of tensor manipulations.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{a...c} \epsilon^{a...c} = n!&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is the number of dimensions, is a common "identity".

===Riemann curvature tensor===

The Ricci and Bianchi identities given in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor illustrate the power of the notation

{|
|[[File:Penrose riemann curvature tensor.svg|thumb|x120px|Notation for the [[Riemann curvature tensor]]]]
|[[File:Penrose ricci tensor.svg|thumb|x120px|[[Ricci tensor]] &lt;math&gt;R_{ab} = R_{acb}^{\ \ \ c}&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose ricci identity.svg|thumb|x120px|Ricci identity &lt;math&gt;(\nabla_a\,\nabla_b -\nabla_b\,\nabla_a)\,\mathbf{\xi}^d&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= R_{abc}^{\ \ \ d}\,\mathbf{\xi}^c&lt;/math&gt;]]
|[[File:Penrose bianchi identity.svg|thumb|120px|[[Bianchi identity]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{[a} R_{bc]d}^{\ \ \ e} = 0&lt;/math&gt;]]

In [[probability]] and [[statistics]],  '''point process notation''' comprises the range of [[mathematical notation]] used to symbolically represent [[random]] [[Mathematical object|objects]] known as [[point process]]es, which are used in related fields such as [[stochastic geometry]], [[spatial statistics]] and [[continuum percolation theory]] and frequently serve as [[mathematical models]] of random phenomena, representable as points, in time, space or both.

The notation varies due to the histories of certain mathematical fields and the different interpretations of point processes,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"&gt;D. Stoyan, W. S. Kendall, J. Mecke, and L. Ruschendorf. ''Stochastic geometry and its applications'', Second Edition, Section 4.1, Wiley Chichester, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/b97277 | first1 = D. J. | last1 = Daley | first2 = D. | last2 = Vere-Jones| title = An Introduction to the Theory of Point Processes | series = Probability and its Applications | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-387-95541-0 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"&gt;M. Haenggi. ''Stochastic geometry for wireless networks''. Chapter 2. Cambridge University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  and borrows notation from mathematical areas of study such as [[measure theory]] and [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

==Interpretation of point processes==

The notation, as well as the  terminology, of point processes depends on their setting and interpretation as mathematical objects which under certain assumptions can be interpreted as random [[sequences]] of points, random [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of points or random [[counting measure]]s.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

===Random sequences of points===

In some mathematical frameworks, a given point process may be considered as a sequence of points with each point randomly positioned in ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; as well as some other more abstract [[mathematical space]]s.  In general, whether  or not  a random sequence is equivalent to the other interpretations of a point process depends on the underlying mathematical space, but this holds true for the setting of finite-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daley | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Vere-Jones | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-49835-5 | title = An Introduction to the Theory of Point Processes | series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-21337-8 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random set of points===

A point process is called ''simple'' if no two (or more points) coincide in location with [[Almost surely|probability one]]. Given that often point processes are simple and the order of the points does not matter, a collection of random points can be considered as a random set of  points&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-38175-4_1 | first1 = A. | last1 = Baddeley | first2 = I. | last2 = Barany | first3 = R. | last3 = Schneider | first4 = W. | last4 = Weil| chapter = Spatial Point Processes and their Applications | title = Stochastic Geometry | series = Lecture Notes in Mathematics | volume = 1892 | pages = 1 | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-38174-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of random sets was independently developed by [[David George Kendall|David Kendall]] and [[Georges Matheron]]. In terms of being considered as a random set, a sequence of random points is a random closed set if the sequence has no [[Limit point#Types of limit points|accumulation points]] with probability one&lt;ref name="schneider2008stochastic"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = R. | last2 = Weil | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-78859-1 | title = Stochastic and Integral Geometry | series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-540-78858-4 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point process is often denoted by a single letter,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"&gt;[[J. F. C. Kingman]]. ''Poisson processes'', volume 3. Oxford university press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moller | first1 = J. | last2 = Plenge Waagepetersen | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1201/9780203496930 | title = Statistical Inference and Simulation for Spatial Point Processes | series = C&amp;H/CRC Monographs on Statistics &amp; Applied Probability | volume = 100 | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-58488-265-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;, and if the point process is considered as a random set, then the corresponding notation:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x\in {N}, &lt;/math&gt;

is used to denote that a random point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of (or [[Element (mathematics)#Notation and terminology|belongs]] to) the point  process &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The theory of random sets can be applied to point processes owing to this interpretation, which alongside the random sequence interpretation has resulted in a point process being written as:

:&lt;math&gt;  \{x_1, x_2,\dots \}=\{x\}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

which highlights its interpretation as either a random sequence or random closed set of points.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; Furthermore, sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_i&lt;/math&gt;) belongs to or is a point of the point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X&lt;/math&gt;, or with set notation, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;

===Random measures===

To denote the number of points of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; located in some [[Borel set]] &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt;, it is sometimes written &lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(B) =\#( B \cap {N}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \Phi(B)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;  \#&lt;/math&gt; is a [[counting measure]], which gives the number of points in some set. In this [[mathematical expression]] the point process is denoted by:

&lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, the symbol:

&lt;math&gt;  \Phi &lt;/math&gt;

represents the number of points of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of random measures,  one  can write:

&lt;math&gt;  \Phi(B)=n&lt;/math&gt;

to denote that there is the set &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;  n&lt;/math&gt; points of &lt;math&gt; {N}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a point process can be considered as a [[random measure]] that assigns some non-negative integer-valued [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]]  to sets.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; This interpretation has motivated a point process being considered just another name for a ''random counting measure''&lt;ref name="molvcanov2005theory"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/1-84628-150-4 | title = Theory of Random Sets | first = Ilya | last = Molchanov| series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-85233-892-X | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}} and the techniques of random measure theory offering another way to study point processes,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grandell1977point"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grandell | first1 = Jan | year = 1977 | title = Point Processes and Random Measures | journal = Advances in Applied Probability  | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 502–526 | publisher = Applied Probability Trust | jstor = 1426111 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also induces the use of the various notations used in [[Integral#Terminology and notation|integration]] and measure theory. {{efn|As discussed in Chapter 1 of Stoyan, Kendall and Mechke,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; varying [[integral]] notation in general applies to all integrals here and elsewhere.}}

==Dual notation==

The different interpretations of point processes as random sets and counting measures is captured with the often used notation &lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baccelli | first1 = F. O. | title = Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks: Volume I Theory | doi = 10.1561/1300000006 | journal = Foundations and Trends in Networking | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 249–449 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which:

* &lt;math&gt; {N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a set of random points.
* &lt;math&gt; {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a random variable that gives the number of points  of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; (hence it is a random counting measure).

Denoting the counting measure again with &lt;math&gt;  \#&lt;/math&gt;, this dual notation implies:

:&lt;math&gt; {N}(B) =\#(B \cap {N}). &lt;/math&gt;

==Sums==

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is some [[measurable function]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, then the sum of &lt;math&gt;  f(x)&lt;/math&gt; over all the points &lt;math&gt;  x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  {N} &lt;/math&gt; can be written in a number of ways &lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt; such as:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1) + f(x_2)+ \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

which has the random sequence appearance, or with set notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{x\in {N}}f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently, with integration notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{N}} f(x) {N}(dx) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \textbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Sample space|space]] of all possible counting measures, hence putting an  emphasis on the interpretation of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; as a random counting measure. An alternative integration notation may be used to write this integral as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{N}} f \, d{N} &lt;/math&gt;

The dual interpretation of point processes is illustrated when writing the number of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; points in a set &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt; {N}(B)= \sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[indicator function]] &lt;math&gt;  1_B(x) =1&lt;/math&gt; if the point &lt;math&gt;  x&lt;/math&gt; is exists in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; and zero otherwise, which in this setting is also known as a [[Dirac measure]].&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; In this expression the random measure interpretation is on the [[left-hand side]] while the random set notation is used is on the right-hand side.

==Expectations==

The [[average]] or [[expected value]] of a sum of functions over a point process is written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E\left[\sum_{x\in {N}}f(x)\right] \qquad \text{or} \qquad  \int_{\textbf{N}}\sum_{x\in {N}}f(x) P(d{N}), &lt;/math&gt;

where (in the random measure sense) &lt;math&gt;  P&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate [[probability measure]] defined on the space of [[counting measure]]s &lt;math&gt;  \textbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The expected value of &lt;math&gt;  {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt;  can be written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E[{N}(B)]=E\left( \sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x)\right) \qquad \text{or}  \qquad  \int_{\textbf{N}}\sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x) P(d{N}). &lt;/math&gt;

which is also known as the first [[moment measure]] of  &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The expectation of such a random sum, known as a ''shot noise process'' in the theory of point processes, can be calculated with [[Campbell's theorem (probability)#Campbell's theorem: general point process|Campbell's theorem]].&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"/&gt;

==Uses in other fields==

Point processes are employed in other mathematical and statistical disciplines, hence the notation may be used in fields such [[stochastic geometry]], [[spatial statistics]] or [[continuum percolation theory]], and areas which use the methods and theory from these fields.

The '''Polish Mathematical Society''' ({{lang-pl|Polskie Towarzystwo Matematyczne}}) began in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]] in 1917. It was originally simply called the Mathematical Society. It was officially constituted on April 2, 1919.  [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Otto Nikodym]] were among the founders.&lt;ref name=mac&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Steinhaus.html |title=Hugo Dyonizy Steinhaus |author=J.J.

== International Stefan Banach Prize ==
The International Stefan Banach Prize (Polish: ''Międzynarodowa Nagroda im. Stefana Banacha'') is an annual award presented by the Mathematical Society to mathematicians for best doctoral dissertations in the [[mathematical sciences]]. Its aim is to "promote and financially support the most promising young researchers" in the field of [[mathematics]]. It was founded in 2009 and is named in honour of a renowned Polish mathematician [[Stefan Banach]] (1892-1945). The laureates of the award also receive a cash prize of [[Polish złoty|PLN]] 20,000 (c.$5,000).

A '''power law''' is a mathematical relationship between two quantities in which one is directly proportional to some power of the other. The '''power law for cache misses''' was first established by C. K. Chow in his 1974 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1974|title=On Optimization of Storage Hierarchies|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=18|issue=3|pages=194–203|doi=10.1147/rd.183.0194|last1=Chow|first1=C. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by experimental data on hit ratios for stack processing by [[Richard Mattson]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1971|title=Evaluation of multilevel memories|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|volume=7|issue=4|pages=814–819|doi=10.1109/TMAG.1971.1067237|last1=Mattson|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power law of cache misses can be used to narrow down the cache sizes to practical ranges, given a tolerable miss rate, as one of the early steps while designing the [[cache hierarchy]] for a uniprocessor system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|isbn=978-1482211184|last1=Solihin|first1=Yan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power law for cache misses can be stated as

: &lt;math&gt;M = M_0 C^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the miss rate for a cache of size ''C'' and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the miss rate of a baseline cache. The exponent ''α'' is workload-specific and typically ranges from 0.3 to 0.7.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartstein|first=A.|last2=Srinivasan|first2=V.|last3=Puzak|first3=T. R.|last4=Emma|first4=P. G.|date=2006-01-01|title=Cache Miss Behavior: Is It √2?|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1128022.1128064|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Computing Frontiers|series=CF '06|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=313–320|doi=10.1145/1128022.1128064|isbn=1595933026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Caveats ==
The power law can only give an estimate of the miss rate only up to a certain value of cache size. A large enough cache eliminates capacity misses and increasing the cache size further will not reduce the miss rate any further, contrary to the power law's prediction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The validity of the power law of cache misses also depends on the size of working memory set in a given process and also on the temporal re-reference pattern of cache blocks in a process. If a process has a small working memory set relative to the cache size, capacity misses are unlikely and the power law does not hold.

Although conflict misses reduce as associativity increases, Hartstein et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; showed that the power law holds irrespective of set associativity.

Hartstein et al. plotted the number of cache block re-accesses versus their re-reference times for a large number of workloads and found that most also follow an exponential relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;R(t) = R_0 t^{-\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R''(''t'') is the rate of re-referencing. It was found that the exponent ''β'' ranged between 1.7 and 1.3. Theoretically, it was proved that the power laws of cache re-reference and cache miss rate are related by the equation &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1-\beta&lt;/math&gt;. This means that for workloads that do not follow the re-reference power law, the power law of cache misses does not hold true.

== Multilevel cache hierarchy ==
In a multilevel cache hierarchy, the miss pattern of the higher level cache becomes the re-reference pattern of the immediate lower level cache. Hartstein et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; found that whereas the cache misses for lower levels do not follow a strict power law, as long as the lower level cache is considerably larger than the higher level cache, the miss rate function can be approximated to the power law.

'''Proof School''' is a school in San Francisco for pupils who love mathematics. The school opened in the fall of 2015 with 45 students in grades 6–10.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Bizjournals.com_July_5_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2014/10/31/stem-education-math-skills-add-up-at-proof-school.html |title=Math skills add up at Proof School – San Francisco Business Times |newspaper=Bizjournals.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 94.4 students in grades 6–12 are enrolled in Proof School for the academic year (2018–2019).

==Academics==

Proof School is a full-curriculum day school that emphasizes communication, collaboration, and problem solving. The school is accredited by [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].

The school year is divided into 5 'blocks', each of which consist of 6 normal academic weeks and a build week.

Each student has 5 courses: 4 'morning' courses that vary across grades, and a math class. The morning courses meet twice a week: once for 70 minutes, and once for 90 minutes. The math courses meet for two hours and ten minutes every day. 

The (non-post-calculus) math classes focus on a different subject each block: Block 1 is Combinatorics, Block 2 is Algebra, Block 3 is Geometry, Block 4 is Algebra and Pre-Calculus, and Block 5 is Number Theory.

'''''Proofs from THE BOOK''''' is a book of [[mathematical proof]]s by [[Martin Aigner]] and [[Günter M. Ziegler]]. The book is dedicated to the [[mathematician]] [[Paul Erdős]], who often referred to "The Book" in which [[God]] keeps the most elegant proof of each mathematical [[theorem]]. During a lecture in 1985, Erdős said, "You don't have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book."

==Content==
''Proofs from THE BOOK'' contains 32 sections (44 in the fifth edition), each devoted to one theorem but often containing multiple proofs and related results. It spans a broad range of mathematical fields: [[number theory]], [[geometry]], [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[combinatorics]] and [[graph theory]]. Erdős himself made many suggestions for the book, but died before its publication. The book is illustrated by [[Karl Heinrich Hofmann]]. It has gone through five editions in English, and has been translated into Persian, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Korean, Turkish, Russian and Spanish.

In November 2017 the American Mathematical Society announced the 2018 [[Leroy_P._Steele_Prize|Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition]] to be awarded to Aigner and Ziegler for this book.

The proofs include:
*[[Proof of Bertrand's postulate]]
*[[Proof that e is irrational]] (also showing the irrationality of certain related numbers)
*Six proofs of the infinitude of the [[prime number|primes]], including [[Euclid's theorem|Euclid]]'s and [[Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes|Furstenberg's]]
*[[Monsky's theorem]] (4th edition)
*[[Wetzel's problem]] on families of analytic functions with few distinct values
*Steve Fisk's proof of the [[Art gallery problem#Fisk's short proof|art gallery theorem]]

The '''relationship between mathematics and physics''' has been a subject of study of [[philosopher]]s, [[mathematician]]s and [[physicist]]s since [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], and more recently also by [[historian]]s and [[educator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uhden|first1=Olaf|last2=Karam|first2=Ricardo|last3=Pietrocola|first3=Maurício|last4=Pospiech|first4=Gesche|title=Modelling Mathematical Reasoning in Physics Education|journal=Science &amp; Education|date=20 October 2011|volume=21|issue=4|pages=485–506|doi=10.1007/s11191-011-9396-6|bibcode = 2012Sc&amp;Ed..21..485U }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally considered a relationship of great intimacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francis Bailly|author2=Giuseppe Longo|title=Mathematics and the Natural Sciences: The Physical Singularity of Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-dGHyIyI-AC&amp;pg=PA149|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-84816-693-6|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mathematics]] has already been described as "an essential tool for physics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanjay Moreshwar Wagh|author2=Dilip Abasaheb Deshpande|title=Essentials of Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-DmfVjBUPksC&amp;pg=PA3|date=27 September 2012|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

In his work ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', one of the topics treated by [[Aristotle]] is about how the study carried out by mathematicians differs from that carried out by physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lear|first1=Jonathan|title=Aristotle: the desire to understand|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Before giving a [[mathematical proof]] for the formula for the [[volume]] of a [[sphere]], [[Archimedes]] used physical reasoning to discover the solution (imagining the balancing of bodies on a scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mazer|title=The Ellipse: A Historical and Mathematical Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twWkDe1Y9YQC&amp;pg=SA5-PA28|date=26 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-21143-4|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the seventeenth century, many of the most important advances in mathematics appeared motivated by the study of physics, and this continued in the following centuries (although, it has already been appointed that from the nineteenth century, mathematics started to become increasingly independent from physics).&lt;ref name="post"&gt;E. J. Post, [http://www22.pair.com/csdc/pdf/philos.pdf A History of Physics as an Exercise in Philosophy, p. 76.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arkady Plotnitsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dmdUp97S4AYC&amp;pg=PA177 Niels Bohr and Complementarity: An Introduction, p. 177].&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and development of [[calculus]] were strongly linked to the needs of physics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger G.

The current situation is that the mathematical knowledge used in physics is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as in the case of [[superstring theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.particlecentral.com/strings_page.html |title=String theories |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Particle Central |publisher=Four Peaks Technologies |access-date=13 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical problems ==
Some of the problems considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] are the following:

*Explain the effectiveness of mathematics in the study of the physical world: "At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated inquiring minds. How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" —[[Albert Einstein]], in ''Geometry and Experience'' (1921).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]], [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Einstein_geometry.html Geometry and Experience].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clearly delineate mathematics and physics: For some results or discoveries, it is difficult to say to which area they belong: to the mathematics or to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bergé, [https://books.google.com/books?id=umFTtQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Des+rythmes+au+chaos%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=65aEU7LAKeHL8AHc74HwBg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Des rythmes au chaos].&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the geometry of physical space?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Carl Hatfield|title=The Natural and the Normative: Theories of Spatial Perception from Kant to Helmholtz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JikeeDbYeUQC&amp;pg=PA223|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08086-6|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the origin of the axioms of mathematics?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gila Hanna|author2=Hans Niels Jahnke|author3=Helmut Pulte|title=Explanation and Proof in Mathematics: Philosophical and Educational Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bLHye8kSAwC&amp;pg=PA29|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0576-5|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*How does the already existing mathematics influence in the creation and development of [[Theoretical physics#Overview|physical theories]]?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fqxi.org/community/essay/rules |title=FQXi Community Trick or Truth: the Mysterious Connection Between Physics and Mathematics |access-date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is arithmetic ''a priori'' or synthetic? (from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], see [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Van Cleve Professor of Philosophy Brown University|title=Problems from Kant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WHAgt-Mg1AC&amp;pg=PA22|date=16 July 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-534701-2|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is essentially different between doing a physical experiment to see the result and making a mathematical calculation to see the result? (from the [[Alan Turing|Turing]]–[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] debate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ludwig Wittgenstein|author2=R. G. Bosanquet|author3=Cora Diamond|title=Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics, Cambridge, 1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4YUZVq1JSEC&amp;pg=PA96|date=15 October 1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-90426-9|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Do [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply that physical theories will always be incomplete? (from [[Stephen Hawking]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pavel|last=Pudlák|title=Logical Foundations of Mathematics and Computational Complexity: A Gentle Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obxDAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA659|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-319-00119-7|page=659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawking.org.uk/godel-and-the-end-of-physics.html Stephen Hawking. "Godel and the End of the Universe"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is math invented or discovered? (millennium-old question, raised among others by [[Mario Livio]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Mario Livio | authorlink = Mario Livio| doi =  | title = Why math works? | journal = Scientific American | volume =  | pages = 80–83 | year = August 2011 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-math-works/| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In recent times the two disciplines have most often been taught separately, despite all the interrelations between physics and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Karam; Pospiech; &amp; Pietrocola (2010). "[http://www.univ-reims.fr/site/evenement/girep-icpe-mptl-2010-reims-international-conference/gallery_files/site/1/90/4401/22908/29476/30505.pdf Mathematics in physics lessons: developing structural skills]"&lt;/ref&gt; This led some professional mathematicians who were also interested in [[mathematics education]], such as [[Felix Klein]], [[Richard Courant]], [[Vladimir Arnold]] and [[Morris Kline]], to strongly advocate teaching mathematics in a way more closely related to the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Stakhov "[http://www2.fisica.unlp.edu.ar/materias/algebralineal/documentos/mathharm.pdf Dirac’s Principle of Mathematical Beauty, Mathematics of Harmony]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Lesh|author2=Peter L.

{{seealso|Universal approximation theorem}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''representation theorem''' is a theorem that states that every abstract structure with certain properties is [[isomorphic]] to another (abstract or concrete) structure. 

For example, 
*in algebra, 
** [[Cayley's theorem]] states that every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
**:[[Representation theory]]  studies properties of abstract groups via their representations as linear transformations of vector spaces. 
** [[Stone's representation theorem]] for [[Boolean algebra]]s states that every [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is isomorphic to a field of sets. 
**: A variant, Stone's representation theorem for  lattices states that every [[distributive lattice]] is isomorphic to a sublattice of the [[power set]] lattice of some set.
**: Another variant states that there exists a duality (in the sense of an arrow reversing equivalence) between the categories of [[Boolean algebra]]s and that of [[Stone space]]s.
** The [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] states that every [[Lie algebra]] embeds into the commutator Lie algebra of its [[universal enveloping algebra]]. 
** [[Ado's theorem]] states that every finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic zero]] embeds into the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of some finite-dimensional vector space.
** [[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]] states that every [[model (model theory)|model]] of an algebra ''A'' is the homomorphic image of a [[subalgebra]] of a [[direct product]] of copies of ''A''.
*in category theory, 
** The [[Yoneda lemma]] provides a full and faithful limit-preserving embedding of any category into a category of [[presheaves]].
** [[Mitchell's embedding theorem]] for abelian categories realises every small abelian category as a full (and exactly embedded) subcategory of a category of modules over some ring.
**[[Mostowski collapse lemma|Mostowski's collapsing theorem]] states that every well-founded extensional structure is isomorphic to a transitive set with the ∈-relation.
** One of the fundamental theorems in [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory states that every sheaf over a [[topological space]] can be thought of as a sheaf of [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s of some (étalé) bundle over that space: the categories of sheaves on a topological space and that of [[étalé space]]s over it are equivalent, where the equivalence is given by the functor that sends a bundle to its sheaf of (local) sections.
*in functional analysis
** The [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]] embeds any [[C*-algebra]] in an algebra of [[bounded operators]] on some [[Hilbert space]].
** The [[Gelfand representation]] (also known as the commutative Gelfand-Naimark theorem) states that any commutative [[C*-algebra]] is isomorphic to an algebra of continuous functions on its [[Gelfand spectrum]]. It can also be seen as the construction as a duality between the category of commutative [[C*-algebras]] and that of [[compact Hausdorff space]]s.
** The [[Riesz representation theorem]] is actually a list of several theorems; one of them identifies the dual space of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with the set of regular measures on ''X''.
*in geometry
** The [[Whitney embedding theorem]]s embed any abstract [[manifold]] in some [[Euclidean space]].
** The [[Nash embedding theorem]] embeds an abstract [[Riemannian manifold]] isometrically in a [[Euclidean space]].

'''Scientific notation''' (also referred to as '''scientific form''' or '''standard index form''', or '''standard form''' in the UK) is a way of expressing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in [[decimal form]]. It is commonly used by scientists, mathematicians and engineers, in part because it can simplify certain [[arithmetic operations]]. On scientific calculators it is usually known as "SCI" display mode.

In scientific notation all numbers are written in the form 
:''m''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|''n''}}
(''m'' times ten raised to the power of ''n''), where the [[exponentiation|exponent]] ''n'' is an [[integer]], and the [[coefficient]] ''m'' is any [[real number]], called the ''[[significand]]'' or ''mantissa''.&lt;ref name=Yadin2016&gt;{{Citation |title=Computer Systems Architecture |series=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Textbooks in Computing |author-first=Aharon |author-last=Yadin |page=68−69 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |date=2016 |isbn=978-1482231069 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMDBDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122012329/https://books.google.com/books?id=yMDBDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |archive-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term "mantissa" may cause confusion because it is the name of the [[fractional part]] of the [[common logarithm]].&lt;!-- actually these are floating-point terms, not scientific notation --&gt; If the number is negative then a minus sign precedes ''m'' (as in ordinary decimal notation). In [[#Normalized notation|normalized notation]], the exponent is chosen so that the absolute value of the coefficient is at least one but less than ten.

[[Decimal floating point]] is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation.

==Normalized notation==
&lt;!-- linked to --&gt;
{{main|Normalized number}}
Any given real number can be written in the form {{gaps|''m''|e=''n''}} in many ways: for example, 350 can be written as {{val|3.5|e=2}} or {{val|35|e=1}} or {{val|350|e=0}}.&lt;!-- "any given number" includes irrational numbers, which can't --&gt;

In ''normalized'' scientific notation (called "standard form" in the UK), the exponent ''n'' is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' remains at least one but less than ten (1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;|''m''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;10). Thus 350 is written as {{val|3.5|e=2}}. This form allows easy comparison of numbers, as the exponent ''n'' gives the number's [[order of magnitude]]. In normalized notation, the exponent ''n'' is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.5 is written as {{val|5|e=-1}}). The 10 and exponent are often omitted when the exponent is 0.

Normalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields, unless an unnormalized form, such as [[engineering notation]], is desired. Normalized scientific notation is often called '''[[exponentiation|exponential]] notation'''—although the latter term is more general and also applies when ''m'' is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 (as in engineering notation for instance) and to [[base (exponentiation)|base]]s other than 10 (for example, {{gaps|3.15|base=2|e=20}}).

==Engineering notation==
{{Main|Engineering notation}}
Engineering notation (often named "ENG" display mode on scientific calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation in that the exponent ''n'' is restricted to [[multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of ''m'' is in the range 1 ≤ |''m''| &lt; 1000, rather than 1 ≤ |''m''| &lt; 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding [[SI prefixes]], which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, {{val|12.5|e=-9|u=m}} can be read as "twelve-point-five nanometers" and written as {{val|12.5|u=nm}}, while its scientific notation equivalent {{val|1.25|e=-8|u=m}} would likely be read out as "one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight meters".

==Significant figures==
{{Main|Significant figures}}
A significant figure is a digit in a number that adds to its precision. This includes all nonzero numbers, zeroes between significant digits, and zeroes [[Significant figures#Identifying significant digits|indicated to be significant]].
Leading and trailing zeroes are not significant because they exist only to show the scale of the number. Therefore, 1,230,400 usually has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4; the final two zeroes serve only as placeholders and add no precision to the original number.

When a number is converted into normalized scientific notation, it is scaled down to a number between 1 and 10. All of the significant digits remain, but the place holding zeroes are no longer required. Thus 1,230,400 would become 1.2304&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. However, there is also the possibility that the number may be known to six or more significant figures, in which case the number would be shown as (for instance) 1.23040&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, an additional advantage of scientific notation is that the number of significant figures is clearer.

===Estimated final digit(s)===
It is customary in scientific measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements, and to estimate at least one additional digit if there is any information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate. The resulting number contains more information than it would without that extra digit(s), and it (or they) may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).

Additional information about precision can be conveyed through additional notations. It is often useful to know how exact the final digit(s) are. For instance, the accepted value of the unit of elementary charge can properly be expressed as {{val|1.6021766208|(98)|e=-19|ul=C}},&lt;ref name="CUU_2014_e"&gt;{{cite web |title=CODATA Value: Elementary charge ''e'' |work=[[CODATA 2014]]: The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty: Fundamental Physical Constants |publisher=[[NIST]] |date=2014-06-25 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |access-date=2017-06-25 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625091532/http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |archive-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is shorthand for {{val|1.6021766208|0.0000000098|e=-19|u=C}}.

=={{anchor|E notation}}E-notation==
[[Image:Avogadro's number in e notation.jpg|thumb|upright|A calculator display showing the [[Avogadro constant]] in E-notation]]

Most [[calculator]]s and many [[computer program]]s present very large and very small results in scientific notation, typically invoked by a key labelled {{button|EXP}} (for ''exponent''), {{button|EEX}} (for ''enter exponent''), {{button|EE}}, {{button|EX}}, {{button|E}}, or {{button|×10&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} depending on vendor and model. Because [[subscript and superscript|superscripted]] exponents like 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter ''E'' (or ''e'') is often used to represent "times ten raised to the power of" (which would be written as "×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;") and is followed by the value of the exponent; in other words, for any two real numbers ''m'' and ''n'', the usage of "''m''E''n''" would indicate a value of ''m'' × 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. In this usage the character ''e'' is not related to the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']] or the [[exponential function]] ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; (a confusion that is unlikely if scientific notation is represented by a capital ''E''). Although the ''E'' stands for ''exponent'', the notation is usually referred to as ''(scientific) E-notation'' rather than ''(scientific) exponential notation''. The use of E-notation facilitates data entry and readability in textual communication since it minimizes keystrokes, avoids reduced font sizes and provides a simpler and more concise display, but it is not encouraged in some publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author-last=Edwards |author-first=John |date=2009 |title=Submission Guidelines for Authors: HPS 2010 Midyear Proceedings |publisher=Health Physics Society |location=[[McLean, Virginia]] |page=5 |url=http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2013-03-30 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112227/http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* After the introduction of the first [[pocket calculator]]s supporting scientific notation in 1972 ([[HP-35]], [[TI SR-10|SR-10]]) the term ''decapower'' was sometimes used in the emerging user communities for the power-of-ten multiplier in order to better distinguish it from "normal" exponents. Likewise, the letter "D" was used in typewritten numbers. This notation was proposed by Jim Davidson and published in the January 1976 issue of Richard J. Nelson's [[Hewlett-Packard]] newsletter ''[[65&amp;nbsp;Notes]]''&lt;ref name="Davidson_1976"&gt;{{cite journal |title=unknown |author-first=Jim |author-last=Davidson |editor-first=Richard J. |editor-last=Nelson |journal=[[65 Notes]] |date=January 1976 |volume=3 |number=1 |page=4 |id=V3N1P4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[HP-65]] users, and it was adopted and carried over into the [[Texas Instruments]] community by Richard C. Vanderburgh, the editor of the ''[[52-Notes]]'' newsletter for [[TI SR-52|SR-52]] users in November 1976.&lt;ref name="Vanderburgh_1976"&gt;{{cite journal |editor-first=Richard C. |editor-last=Vanderburgh |title=Decapower |journal=52-Notes - Newsletter of the SR-52 Users Club |volume=1 |number=6 |page=1 |date=November 1976 |id=V1N6P1 |url=http://www.claudiolarini.altervista.org/pdf/52NOTES.pdf |access-date=2017-05-28 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528031508/http://www.claudiolarini.altervista.org/pdf/52NOTES.pdf |archive-date=2017-05-28 |quote=''Decapower'' - In the January 1976 issue of [[65 Notes|65-Notes]] (V3N1p4) Jim Davidson ([[HP-65]] Users Club member #547) suggested the term "decapower" as a descriptor for the power-of-ten multiplier used in scientific notation displays. I'm going to begin using it in place of "[[exponent]]" which is technically incorrect, and the letter D to separate the "[[Mantissa (floating point number)|mantissa]]" from the decapower for typewritten numbers, as Jim also suggests. For example, {{sic|&lt;tt&gt;123|&lt;sup&gt;−45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;|expected=&lt;tt&gt;123×10&lt;sup&gt;−45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}} which is displayed in scientific notation as &lt;tt&gt;1.23 -43&lt;/tt&gt; will now be written &lt;tt&gt;1.23D-43&lt;/tt&gt;. Perhaps, as this notation gets more and more usage, the calculator manufacturers will change their keyboard abbreviations. HP's {{button|EEX}} and TI's {{button|EE}} could be changed to {{button|ED}} (for enter decapower).}} [https://www.rskey.org/DOCUMENTS/52NOTES/52v1n6.html&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20170528122342/https://www.rskey.org/DOCUMENTS/52NOTES/52v1n6.html --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803040138/http://www.rskey.org/DOCUMENTS/52NOTES/52v1n6.html |date=2014-08-03}} (NB. The term ''decapower'' was frequently used in subsequent issues of this newsletter up to at least 1978.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* FORTRAN (at least since [[FORTRAN IV]] as of 1961&lt;!-- possibly also by some versions of FORTRAN II and III --&gt;) also uses "D" to signify [[double precision]] numbers in scientific notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.hawaii.edu/lab/197/fortran/fort3.htm#double |title=UH Mānoa Mathematics » Fortran lesson 3: Format, Write, etc. |publisher=Math.hawaii.edu |date=2012-02-12 |access-date=2012-03-06 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208180836/http://www.math.hawaii.edu/lab/197/fortran/fort3.htm#double |archive-date=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[ALGOL|ALGOL 60]] (1960) programming language uses a subscript ten "&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;" character instead of the letter E, for example: {{nowrap begin}}&lt;code lang="ALGOL"&gt;6.022&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;23&lt;/code&gt;{{nowrap end}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Naur |editor-link=Peter Naur |location=Copenhagen |date=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savard_2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Computer Arithmetic |at=The Early Days of Hexadecimal |author-first=John J.

* The use of the "&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;" in the various Algol standards provided a challenge on some computer systems that did not provide such a "&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;" character. As a consequence [[Stanford University]] [[Algol-W]] required the use of a single quote, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;6.02486'+23&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/68/86/CS-TR-68-86.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-08 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909195915/http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/68/86/CS-TR-68-86.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Soviet Algol variants allowed the use of the Cyrillic character "[[Yu (Cyrillic)|ю]]" character, e.g. 6.022ю+23.

* The [[Simula]] programming language requires the use of &amp; (or &amp;&amp; for [[Double precision|long]]), for example: {{nowrap begin}}&lt;code lang="Simula"&gt;6.022&amp;23&lt;/code&gt;{{nowrap end}} {{nowrap begin}}(or &lt;code lang="Simula"&gt;6.022&amp;&amp;23&lt;/code&gt;){{nowrap end}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SIMULA standard as defined by the SIMULA Standards Group - 3.1 Numbers |url=http://prosjekt.ring.hibu.no/simula/Standard/chap_1.htm |access-date=2009-10-06 |date=August 1986 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724175858/http://prosjekt.ring.hibu.no/simula/Standard/chap_1.htm |archive-date=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Wolfram Language]] (utilized in [[Mathematica]]) allows a shorthand notation of &lt;code lang="Mathematica"&gt;6.022*^23&lt;/code&gt;. (Instead, &lt;code lang="Mathematica"&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; denotes the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']]).

=={{Anchor|Dex}}Order of magnitude==&lt;!-- The anchor tag is for the 'Decimal exponent' redirect --&gt;
{{Main|Order of magnitude}}
Scientific notation also enables simpler order-of-magnitude comparisons. A [[proton]]'s mass is {{val|0.0000000000000000000000000016726|u=kg}}. If written as {{val|1.6726|e=-27|u=kg}}, it is easier to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below.  The [[order of magnitude]] of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more [[error-prone]] task of counting the leading zeros.  In this case, −27 is larger than −31 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ({{val|10000|fmt=commas}} times) more massive than the electron.

Scientific notation also avoids misunderstandings due to regional differences in certain quantifiers, such as ''[[Long and short scales|billion]]'', which might indicate either 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.

In physics and astrophysics, the number of orders of magnitude between two numbers is sometimes referred to as "dex", a contraction of "decimal exponent". For instance, if two numbers are within 1&amp;nbsp;dex of each other, then the ratio of the larger to the smaller number is less than 10. Fractional values can be used, so if within 0.5&amp;nbsp;dex, the ratio is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt;, and so on.

==Use of spaces==
In normalized scientific notation, in E-notation, and in engineering notation, the [[Space (punctuation)|space]] (which in [[typesetting]] may be represented by a normal width space or a [[thin space]]) that is allowed ''only'' before and after "×" or in front of "E" is sometimes omitted, though it is less common to do so before the alphabetical character.&lt;ref&gt;Samples of usage of terminology and variants: {{cite web |url=http://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/665/1/WHOI-76-59.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-19 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217135249/https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/665/1/WHOI-76-59.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-17}}, [http://www.brookscole.com/physics_d/templates/student_resources/003026961X_serway/review/expnot.html], {{cite web |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/nsf/tutorial/ss/ssnot.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-04-07 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125922/http://www.brynmawr.edu/nsf/tutorial/ss/ssnot.html |archive-date=2007-04-04}}, {{cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/Units/sci_notation.html |access-date=2007-04-07 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225085247/http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/Units/sci_notation.html |archive-date=2007-02-25}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061029195358/http://www.gnsphysics.com/mathreview.pdf], [http://www.ttinet.com/doc/language_v44_003.html#heading_3.2.4.2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503005623/http://www.ttinet.com/doc/language_v44_003.html |date=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering notation, this is written {{val|40|e=6|u=m}}. In [[International System of Units|SI writing style]], this may be written {{val|40|u=Mm}}"(''40 megameters'').
* An [[inch]] is defined as ''exactly'' 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm. Quoting a value of 25.400&amp;nbsp;mm shows that the value is correct to the nearest micrometer. An approximated value with only two significant digits would be {{val|2.5|e=1|u=mm}} instead. As there is no limit to the number of significant digits, the length of an inch could, if required, be written as (say) {{val|2.54000000000|e=1|u=mm}} instead.

==Converting numbers==
Converting a number in these cases means to either convert the number into scientific notation form, convert it back into decimal form or to change the exponent part of the equation. None of these alter the actual number, only how it's expressed.

===Decimal to scientific===
First, move the decimal separator point sufficient places, ''n'', to put the number's value within a desired range, between 1 and 10 for normalized notation. If the decimal was moved to the left, append "×&amp;nbsp;10''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''"; to the right, "×&amp;nbsp;10''&lt;sup&gt;−n&lt;/sup&gt;''". To represent the number {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}} in normalized scientific notation, the decimal separator would be moved 6 digits to the left and "×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;" appended, resulting in {{val|1.2304|e=6}}. The number {{val|-0.0040321}} would have its decimal separator shifted 3 digits to the right instead of the left and yield {{val|-4.0321|e=-3}} as a result.

===Scientific to decimal===
Converting a number from scientific notation to decimal notation, first remove the ''×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' on the end, then shift the decimal separator ''n'' digits to the right (positive ''n'') or left (negative ''n''). The number {{val|1.2304|e=6}} would have its decimal separator shifted 6 digits to the right and become {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}}, while {{val|-4.0321|e=-3}} would have its decimal separator moved 3 digits to the left and be {{val|-0.0040321}}.

=== Exponential===
Conversion between different scientific notation representations of the same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part. The decimal separator in the significand is shifted ''x'' places to the left (or right) and ''x'' is added to (or subtracted from) the exponent, as shown below.

: {{val|1.234|e=3}} = {{val|12.34|e=2}} = {{val|123.4|e=1}} = 1234

==Basic operations==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Addition]] --&gt;
Given two numbers in scientific notation,

:&lt;math&gt;x_0=m_0\times10^{n_0}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;x_1=m_1\times10^{n_1}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are performed using the rules for operation with [[exponentiation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_0 x_1=m_0 m_1\times10^{n_0+n_1}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x_0}{x_1}=\frac{m_0}{m_1}\times10^{n_0-n_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Some examples are:
:&lt;math&gt;5.67\times10^{-5} \times 2.34\times10^2 \approx 13.3\times10^{-5+2} = 13.3\times10^{-3} = 1.33\times10^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2.34\times10^2}{5.67\times10^{-5}}  \approx 0.413\times10^{2-(-5)} = 0.413\times10^{7} = 4.13\times10^6&lt;/math&gt;

[[Addition]] and [[subtraction]] require the numbers to be represented using the same exponential part, so that the significand can be simply added or subtracted:

:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = m_0 \times10^{n_0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1 = m_1 \times10^{n_1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n_0 = n_1&lt;/math&gt;

Next, add or subtract the significands:

:&lt;math&gt;x_0 \pm x_1=(m_0\pm m_1)\times10^{n_0}&lt;/math&gt;

An example:

:&lt;math&gt;2.34\times10^{-5} + 5.67\times10^{-6} = 2.34\times10^{-5} + 0.567\times10^{-5} = 2.907\times10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;

=={{anchor|B notation|P notation}}Other bases==
While base ten is normally used for scientific notation, powers of other bases can be used too,&lt;ref name="TI_1974_SR-22"&gt;{{cite book |title=electronic hexadecimal calculator/converter SR-22 |publisher=[[Texas Instruments Incorporated]] |date=1974 |page=7 |edition=Revision A |id=1304-389 Rev A |url=http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/SR-22_US.pdf |access-date=2017-03-20 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320001329/http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/SR-22_US.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-20}} (NB. This calculator supports floating point numbers in scientific notation in bases 8, 10 and 16.)&lt;/ref&gt; base 2 being the next most commonly used one.

For example, in base-2 scientific notation, the number 1001&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; in [[binary numeral system|binary]] (=9&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) is written as 
1.001&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or 1.001&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; using binary numbers (or shorter 1.001&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; if binary context is obvious). In E-notation, this is written as 1.001&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;E11&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; (or shorter: 1.001E11) with the letter ''E'' now standing for "times two (10&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) to the power" here. In order to better distinguish this base-2 exponent from a base-10 exponent, a base-2 exponent is sometimes also indicated by using the letter ''B'' instead of ''E'',&lt;ref name="HP16C-Lib"/&gt; a shorthand notation originally proposed by [[Bruce Alan Martin]] of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in 1968,&lt;ref name="Martin_1968"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Letters to the editor: On binary notation |author-first=Bruce Alan |author-last=Martin |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=11 |issue=10 |date=October 1968 |page=658 |doi=10.1145/364096.364107}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in 1.001&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;B11&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; (or shorter: 1.001B11). For comparison, the same number in [[decimal representation]]: 1.125&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (using decimal representation), or 1.125B3 (still using decimal representation). Some calculators use a mixed representation for binary floating point numbers, where the exponent is displayed as decimal number even in binary mode, so the above becomes 1.001&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or shorter 1.001B3.&lt;ref name="HP16C-Lib"&gt;{{cite book |title=HP16C Emulator Library for the HP48S/SX |author-first1=Jake |author-last1=Schwartz |author-first2=Rick |author-last2=Grevelle |date=2003-10-20 |orig-year=1993&lt;!-- 1993-04 --&gt; |edition=1 |version=1.20 |url=http://www.pahhc.org/mul8r.htm |access-date=2015-08-15 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621211708/http://www.pahhc.org/mul8r.htm |archive-date=2016-06-21}} (NB. This library also works on the [[HP 48G]]/[[HP 48GX|GX]]/[[HP 48G+|G+]]. Beyond the feature set of the [[HP-16C]], this package also supports calculations for binary, octal, and hexadecimal [[floating-point number]]s in scientific notation in addition to the usual decimal floating-point numbers.)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is closely related to the base-2 [[floating-point]] representation commonly used in computer arithmetic, and the usage of IEC [[binary prefixes]] (e.g. 1B10 for 1×2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; ([[kibi-|kibi]]), 1B20 for 1×2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; ([[mebi-|mebi]]), 1B30 for 1×2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; ([[gibi-|gibi]]), 1B40 for 1×2&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; ([[tebi-|tebi]])).

Similar to ''B'' (or ''b''&lt;ref name="HP16C-Add"&gt;{{cite book |title=HP16C Emulator Library for the HP48 - Addendum to the Operator's Manual |author-first1=Jake |author-last1=Schwartz |author-first2=Rick |author-last2=Grevelle |date=2003-10-21 |edition=1 |version=1.20 |url=http://www.pahhc.org/mul8r.htm |access-date=2015-08-15 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621211708/http://www.pahhc.org/mul8r.htm |archive-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the letters ''H''&lt;ref name="HP16C-Lib"/&gt; (or ''h''&lt;ref name="HP16C-Add"/&gt;) and ''O''&lt;ref name="HP16C-Lib"/&gt; (or ''o'',&lt;ref name="HP16C-Add"/&gt; or ''C''&lt;ref name="HP16C-Lib"/&gt;) are sometimes also used to indicate ''times 16 or 8 to the power'' as in 1.25 = 1.40&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.40H0 = 1.40h0, or 98000 = 2.7732&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.7732o5 = 2.7732C5.&lt;ref name="HP16C-Lib"/&gt;

Another similar convention to denote base-2 exponents is using a letter ''P'' (or ''p'', for "power"). In this notation the significand is always meant to be hexadecimal, whereas the exponent is always meant to be decimal.&lt;ref name="Rationale_2003_C"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rationale for International Standard - Programming Languages - C |version=5.10 |date=April 2003 |pages=52, 153–154, 159 |url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf |access-date=2010-10-17 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606072228/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf |archive-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notation can be produced by implementations of the ''[[printf]]'' family of functions following the [[C99]] specification and ([[Single Unix Specification]]) [[IEEE Std 1003.1]] [[POSIX]] standard, when using the ''%a'' or ''%A'' conversion specifiers.&lt;ref name="Rationale_2003_C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="printf_2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=dprintf, fprintf, printf, snprintf, sprintf - print formatted output |work=The Open Group Base Specifications |edition=Issue 7, IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 |date=2013 |orig-year=2001 |author=The IEEE and The Open Group |url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html |access-date=2016-06-21 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621211105/http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html |archive-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beebe_2017_Hex"&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Nelson H.

[[File:PlusMinus.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[plus and minus signs|plus and minus symbols]] are used to show the sign of a number.]]

In [[mathematics]], the concept of '''sign''' originates from the property of every non-zero [[real number]] of being positive or [[negative number|negative]]. [[0 (number)|Zero]] itself is signless, although in some contexts it makes sense to consider a [[signed zero]], and in some contexts it makes sense to call 0 its own sign. Along with its application to real numbers, "change of sign" is used throughout mathematics and [[physics]] to denote the [[additive inverse]] (negation, or multiplication by [[−1]]), even for quantities which are not real numbers (so, which are not prescribed to be either positive, negative, or zero). Also, the word "sign" can indicate aspects of mathematical objects that resemble positivity and negativity, such as the [[Parity of a permutation|sign of a permutation]] (see [[#Other meanings|below]]).

==Sign of a number==
Every number has multiple attributes (such as value, sign and [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]). A [[real number]] is said to be positive if its value (''not'' its magnitude) is [[inequality (mathematics)|greater than]] zero, and [[negative number|negative]] if it is less than zero.  The attribute of being positive or negative is called the '''sign''' of the number.  Zero itself is not considered to have a sign (though this is context dependent, see below).  Also, signs are not defined for [[complex numbers]], although the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] generalizes it in some sense.

In common [[numeral system|numeral notation]] (which is used in [[arithmetic]] and elsewhere), the sign of a number is often denoted by placing [[plus and minus signs|a plus sign or a minus sign]] before the number.  For example, +3  denotes "positive three", and −3 denotes "negative three". When no plus or minus sign is given, the default interpretation is that a number is positive. Because of this notation, as well as the definition of negative numbers through [[subtraction]], the [[minus sign]] is perceived to have a strong association with negative numbers (of the negative sign). Likewise, "+" associates with positivity.

In [[algebra]], a minus sign is usually thought of as representing the operation of [[additive inverse]] (sometimes called ''negation''), with the additive inverse of a positive number being negative and the additive inverse of a negative number being positive.  In this context, it makes sense to write −(−3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+3.

Any non-zero number can be changed to a positive one using the [[absolute value]] function.  For example, the absolute value of −3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3.  In symbols, this would be written |−3| = 3 and |3| = 3.

===Sign of zero===
The number [[0 (number)|zero]] is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign.  In arithmetic, +0 and −0 both denote the same number 0, which is the additive inverse of itself.

Note that this definition is culturally determined. In France and Belgium, 0 is said to be both positive and negative. The positive numbers without zero and the negative numbers without zero are said to be "strictly positive" and "strictly negative" respectively.

In some contexts, such as [[signed number representations]] in [[computing]], it makes sense to consider signed versions of zero, with positive zero and negative zero being different numbers (see [[signed zero]]).

One also sees +0 and −0 in [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis]] when evaluating [[one-sided limit]]s. This notation refers to the behaviour of a function as the input variable approaches 0 from positive or negative values respectively; these behaviours are not necessarily the same.

==={{anchor|non-negative and non-positive}} Terminology for signs===
&lt;!-- Several articles link to the above anchor --&gt;
Because zero is neither positive nor negative (in most countries), the following phrases are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number:
* A number is '''positive''' if it is greater than zero.
* A number is '''negative''' if it is less than zero.
* A number is '''non-negative''' if it is greater than or equal to zero.
* A number is '''non-positive''' if it is less than or equal to zero.
Thus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero.  For example, the [[absolute value]] of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.

The same terminology is sometimes used for [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] that take real or integer values.  For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.

===Sign convention===
{{main|Sign convention}}
In many contexts the choice of sign convention (which range of values is considered positive and which negative) is natural, whereas in others the choice is arbitrary subject only to consistency, the latter necessitating an explicit sign convention.

==Sign function==
[[Image:Signum function.svg|thumb|200px|Signum function ''y'' = sgn(''x'')]]
{{main|Sign function}}
The '''sign function''' or '''signum function''' is sometimes used to extract the sign of a number.  This function is usually defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \sgn(x) = \begin{cases}
-1 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0, \\ 
~~\, 0 &amp; \text{if } x = 0, \\
~~\, 1 &amp; \text{if } x &gt; 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus sgn(''x'') is 1 when ''x'' is positive, and sgn(''x'') is −1 when ''x'' is negative.  For nonzero values of ''x'', this function can also be defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; \sgn(x) = \frac{x}{|x|} = \frac{|x|}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
where |''x''| is the [[absolute value]] of ''x''.

==Meanings of sign==

===Sign of an angle===
[[File:Angles on the unit circle.svg|right|thumb|Measuring from the [[x-axis]], angles on the [[unit circle]] count as positive in the [[counterclockwise]] direction, and negative in the [[clockwise]] direction.]]
In many contexts, it is common to associate a sign with the measure of an [[angle]], particularly an oriented angle or an angle of [[rotation]].  In such a situation, the sign indicates whether the angle is in the [[clockwise]] or counterclockwise direction.  Though different conventions can be used, it is common in [[mathematics]] to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.

It is also possible to associate a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the [[axis of rotation]] has been oriented.  Specifically, a [[right-hand rule|right-handed]] rotation around an oriented axis typically counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.

===Sign of a change===
When a quantity ''x'' changes over time, the [[Finite difference|change]] in the value of ''x'' is typically defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = x_\text{final} - x_\text{initial}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this convention, an increase in ''x'' counts as positive change, while a decrease of ''x'' counts as negative change.  In [[calculus]], this same convention is used in the definition of the [[derivative]].  As a result, any [[Monotonic function|increasing function]] has positive derivative, while a decreasing function has negative derivative.

===Sign of a direction===
In [[analytic geometry]] and [[physics]], it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative.  For a basic example, the [[number line]] is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left:
[[File:Number-line.svg|center|600px]]
As a result, when discussing [[linear motion]], [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[velocity]] to the right is usually thought of as being positive, while similar motion to the left is thought of as being negative.

On the [[Cartesian plane]], the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive ''x''-direction, and upward being the positive ''y''-direction.  If a displacement or velocity [[Euclidean vector|vector]] is separated into its [[vector component]]s, then the horizontal part will be positive for motion to the right and negative for motion to the left, while the vertical part will be positive for motion upward and negative for motion downward.

{{main|Signedness}}
In [[computing]], an integer value may be either signed or unsigned, depending on whether the computer is keeping track of a sign for the number.  By restricting an integer [[Variable (programming)|variable]] to non-negative values only, one more [[bit]] can be used for storing the value of a number.  Because of the way integer arithmetic is done within computers, the sign of a signed integer variable is usually not stored as a single independent bit, but is instead stored using [[two's complement]] or some other [[signed number representation]].

In contrast, real numbers are stored and manipulated as [[Floating point]] values.  The floating point values are represented using three separate values, mantissa, exponent, and sign.  Given this separate sign bit, it is possible to represent both positive and negative zero.  Most programming languages normally treat positive zero and negative zero as equivalent values, albeit, they provide means by which the distinction can be detected.

===Other meanings===
[[File:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|right|[[Electric charge]] may be positive or negative.]]
In addition to the sign of a real number, the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and the sciences:
* Words ''[[up to]] sign'' mean that for a quantity {{mvar|q}} is known that either {{math|1=''q'' = ''Q''}} or {{math|1=''q'' = −''Q''}} for certain {{mvar|Q}}. It is often expressed as {{math|1=''q'' = [[±]]''Q''}}. For real numbers, it means that only the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}}''q''{{!}}}} of the quantity is known. For [[complex numbers]] and [[vector space|vectors]], a quantity known up to sign is a stronger condition than a quantity with known [[norm (mathematics)|magnitude]]: aside {{mvar|Q}} and {{math|−''Q''}}, there are many other possible values of {{mvar|q}} such that {{math|1={{!}}''q''{{!}} = {{!}}''Q''{{!}}}}.
* The [[Parity of a permutation|sign of a permutation]] is defined to be positive if the permutation is even, and negative if the permutation is odd.
* In [[graph theory]], a [[signed graph]] is a graph in which each edge has been marked with a positive or negative sign.
* In [[mathematical analysis]], a [[signed measure]] is a generalization of the concept of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] in which the measure of a set may have positive or negative values.
* In a [[signed-digit representation]], each digit of a number may have a positive or negative sign.
* The ideas of [[signed area]] and [[signed volume]] are sometimes used when it is convenient for certain areas or volumes to count as negative.  This is particularly true in the theory of [[determinant]]s. In an (abstract) [[orientation (vector space)|oriented vector space]], each ordered basis for the vector space can be classified as either positively or negatively oriented.
* In [[physics]], any [[electric charge]] comes with a sign, either positive or negative.  By convention, a positive charge is a charge with the same sign as that of a [[proton]], and a negative charge is a charge with the same sign as that of an [[electron]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1713">In mathematics, more precisely, in the theory of [[simplicial set]]s, a '''simplicial group''' is a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category of groups]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1444">In mathematics, Weinstein's '''symplectic category''' is (roughly) a [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are [[symplectic manifold]]s and whose morphisms are '''canonical relations''', inclusions of [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s ''L'' into &lt;math&gt;M \times N^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, where the superscript minus means minus the given symplectic form (for example, the graph of a [[symplectomorphism]]; hence, minus). The notion was introduced by [[Alan Weinstein]], according to whom "Quantization problems&lt;ref&gt;He means [[geometric quantization]].&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the category of symplectic manifolds and symplectomorphisms be augmented by the inclusion of canonical relations as morphisms." The composition of canonical relations is given by a [[fiber product]].

Strictly speaking, the symplectic category is not a well-defined category (since the composition may not be well-defined) without some transversality conditions.

'''''The Story of Maths''''' is a four-part British [[television]] series outlining aspects of the [[history of mathematics]]. It was a co-production between the [[Open University]] and the [[BBC]] and aired in October 2008 on [[BBC Four]]. The material was written and presented by [[University of Oxford]] professor [[Marcus du Sautoy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/audio/2008/oct/13/science-weekly-podcast Guardian interview]&lt;/ref&gt; The consultants were the Open University academics [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin Wilson]], professor [[Jeremy Gray]] and June Barrow-Green. Kim Duke is credited as series producer.&lt;ref name = Ep4&gt;''To Infinity and Beyond'' 27 October 2008 21:00 BBC Four&lt;/ref&gt;

The series comprised four programmes respectively titled: ''The Language of the Universe''; ''The Genius of the East''; ''The Frontiers of Space''; and'' To Infinity and Beyond''. Du Sautoy documents the development of mathematics covering subjects such as the invention of zero and the unproven [[Riemann hypothesis]], a 150-year-old problem for whose solution the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has offered a $1,000,000 prize. He escorts viewers through the subject's history and geography. He examines the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how mathematical ideas underpin the world's science, technology, and culture.

He starts his journey in [[Egyptian mathematics|ancient Egypt]] and finishes it by looking at current mathematics. Between he travels through [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylon]], [[Greek mathematics|Greece]], [[Indian mathematics|India]], [[Chinese mathematics|China]], and the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|medieval Middle East]]. He also looks at mathematics in Europe and then in America and takes the viewers inside the lives of many of the greatest mathematicians.

=="The Language of the Universe"==
In this opening programme Marcus du Sautoy looks at how important and fundamental mathematics is to our lives before looking at the mathematics of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].

Du Sautoy commences in [[Egyptian mathematics|Egypt]] where recording the patterns of the seasons and in particular the flooding of the [[Nile]] was essential to their economy. There was a need to solve practical problems such as land area for taxation purposes.&lt;ref name= Ep1&gt;BBC Four; ''The Language of the Universe;'' 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm 6 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Du Sautoy discovers the use of a decimal system based on the fingers on the hands, the unusual method for multiplication and division. He examines the [[Rhind Papyrus]], the [[Moscow Papyrus]] and explores their understanding of binary numbers, fractions and solid shapes.

He then travels to [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylon]] and discovered that the way we tell the time today is based on the [[Babylonian numerals|Babylonian 60 base number system]]. So because of the Babylonians we have 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. He then shows how the Babylonians used [[quadratic equation]]s to measure their land. He deals briefly with [[Plimpton 322]].

In Greece, the home of ancient [[Greek mathematics]], he looks at the contributions of some of its greatest and well known mathematicians including [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], [[Euclid]], and [[Archimedes]], who are some of the people who are credited with beginning the transformation of mathematics from a tool for counting into the analytical subject we know today. A controversial figure, Pythagoras’ teachings were considered suspect and his followers seen as social outcasts and a little be strange and not in the norm. There is a legend going around that one of his followers, [[Hippasus]], was drowned when he announced his discovery of [[irrational number]]s. As well as his work on the properties of right angled triangles, Pythagoras developed another important theory after observing musical instruments. He discovered that the intervals between harmonious musical notes are always in whole number intervals.&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenLearn]]: [http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-the-story-maths-the-language-the-universe The Language of the Universe]; accessed 12 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It deals briefly with [[Hypatia of Alexandria]].

=="The Genius of the East"==
With the decline of ancient Greece, the development of maths stagnated in Europe. However the progress of mathematics continued in the East. Du Sautoy describes both the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese use of maths]] in [[History of science and technology in China|engineering projects]] and their belief in the mystical powers of numbers. He mentions [[Qin Jiushao]].

He describes [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]]’ invention of [[trigonometry]]; their introduction of a symbol for the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and their contribution to the new concepts of [[infinity]] and [[negative number]]s. It shows [[Gwalior Fort]] where zero is inscribed on its walls. It mentions the work of [[Brahmagupta]] and [[Bhāskara II]] on the subject of zero. He mentions [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] and [[Aryabhata]] and illustrates the - historically first exact - [[Madhava of Sangamagrama#The value of π (pi)|formula for calculating the π (pi)]].&lt;ref name="BBC_2008"&gt;[http://vimeo.com/74859005 BBC documentary "The Story of Maths", second part], showing a visualization of the historically first exact formula, starting at 35 min and 20 sec into the second part of the documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Sautoy then considers [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|the Middle East]]: the invention of the new language of [[algebra]] and the evolution of a solution to [[Cubic function|cubic equations]]. He talks about the [[House of Wisdom]] with [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] and he visits [[University of Al-Karaouine]]. He mentions [[Omar Khayyám]].

Finally he examines the spread of [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Eastern knowledge to the West]] through mathematicians such as [[Leonardo Fibonacci]], famous for the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenLearn]]: [http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-the-story-maths-the-genius-the-east The Genius of the East]; accessed 12 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]].

=="The Frontiers of Space"==
{{Infobox Painting| image_file=Piero - The Flagellation.jpg

{{see also|Mathematics and art}}

From the seventeenth century, Europe replaced the Middle East as the engine house of mathematical ideas. Du Sautoy visits [[Urbino]] to introduce [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] using mathematician and artist,  [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''[[Flagellation of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]''.&lt;ref name = Ep3&gt;''The Frontiers of Space'' 20 October 2008 21:00 BBC Four&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Sautoy  proceeds to describes [[René Descartes]] realisation that it was possible to describe curved lines as equations and thus link algebra and geometry. He talks with [[Henk J. M. Bos]] about Descartes. He shows how one of [[Pierre de Fermat]]’s theorems is now the basis for the codes that protect credit card transactions on the internet. He describes Isaac Newton’s development of math and physics crucial to understanding the behaviour of moving objects in engineering. He covers the [[Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy]] and the [[Bernoulli family]]. He further covers [[Leonhard Euler]], the father of topology, and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]' invention of a new way of handling equations, modular arithmetic. He mentions [[János Bolyai]].

The further contribution of Gauss to our understanding of how [[prime numbers]] are distributed is covered thus providing the platform for [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s theories on prime numbers. In addition Riemann worked on the properties of objects, which he saw as manifolds that could exist in multi-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenLearn]]: [http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-the-story-maths-the-frontiers-space The Frontiers of Space]; accessed 12 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=="To Infinity and Beyond"==

===Hilbert's first problem===
The final episode considers the great unsolved problems that confronted mathematicians in the 20th century. On 8 August 1900 [[David Hilbert]] gave a historic talk at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris. Hilbert posed [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three then unsolved problems]] in mathematics which he believed were of the most immediate importance. Hilbert succeeded in setting the agenda for 20thC mathematics and the programme commenced with [[Hilbert's first problem]].

[[Georg Cantor]] considered the infinite set of whole numbers 1, 2, 3 ... ∞ which he compared with the smaller set of numbers 10, 20, 30 ... ∞. Cantor showed that these two infinite sets of numbers actually had the same size as it was possible to pair each number up; 1 - 10, 2 - 20, 3 - 30 ... etc.

If fractions now are considered there are an infinite number of fractions between any of the two whole numbers, suggesting that the infinity of fractions is bigger than the infinity of whole numbers. Yet Cantor was still able to pair each such fraction to a whole number 1 - &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; 2 - &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; 3 - &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... etc. through to ∞; i.e. the infinities of both fractions and whole numbers were shown to have the same size.

But when the set of all infinite decimal numbers was considered, Cantor was able to prove that this produced a bigger infinity. This was because, no matter how one tried to construct such a list, Cantor was able to provide a new decimal number that was missing from that list. Thus he showed that there were different infinities, some bigger than others.

However, there was a problem that Cantor was unable to solve: Is there an infinity sitting between the smaller infinity of all the fractions and the larger infinity of the decimals? Cantor believed, in what became known as the [[Continuum Hypothesis]], that there is no such set. This would be the first problem listed by Hilbert.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Poincaré conjecture===
Next Marcus discusses [[Henri Poincaré]]'s work on the discipline of 'Bendy geometry'. If two shapes can be moulded or morphed to each other's shape then they have the same topology. Poincaré was able to identify all possible two-dimensional topological surfaces; however in 1904 he came up with a topological problem, the [[Poincaré conjecture]], that he could not solve; namely what are all the possible shapes for a 3D universe.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

According to the programme, the [[Solution of the Poincaré conjecture|question was solved]] in 2002 by [[Grigori Perelman]] who linked the problem to a different area of mathematics. Perelman looked at the dynamics of the way things can flow over the shape. This enabled him to find all the ways that 3D space could be wrapped up in higher dimensions.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===David Hilbert===
The achievements of David Hilbert were now considered. In addition to [[Hilbert's problems]], [[Hilbert space]], Hilbert Classification and the Hilbert Inequality, du Sautoy highlights Hilbert's early work on equations as marking him out as a mathematician able to think in new ways. Hilbert showed that, while there were an infinity of equations, these equations could be constructed from a finite number of building block like sets. Hilbert could not construct that list of sets; he simply proved that it existed. In effect Hilbert had created a new more abstract style of Mathematics.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Hilbert's second problem===
For 30 years Hilbert believed that mathematics was a universal language powerful enough to unlock all the truths and solve each of his 23 Problems. Yet, even as Hilbert was stating ''We must know, we will know'', [[Kurt Gödel]] had shattered this belief; he had  formulated the [[Incompleteness Theorem]] based on his study of [[Hilbert's second problem]]:

:''This statement cannot be proved''

Using a [[Gödel's encoding|code based on prime numbers]], Gödel was able to transform the above into a pure statement of arithmetic. Logically, the above cannot be false and hence Gödel had discovered the existence of mathematical statements that were true but were incapable of being proved.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Hilbert's first problem revisited===
In 1950s American mathematician [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] took up the challenge of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which asks "is there is or isn't there an infinite set of number bigger than the set of whole numbers but smaller than the set of all decimals". Cohen found that there existed two equally consistent mathematical worlds. In one world the Hypothesis was true and there did not exist such a set. Yet there existed a mutually exclusive but equally consistent mathematical proof that Hypothesis was false and there was such a set. Cohen would subsequently work on [[Hilbert's eighth problem]], the [[Riemann hypothesis]], although without the success of his earlier work.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Hilbert's tenth problem===
[[Hilbert's tenth problem]] asked if there was some universal method that could tell whether any equation had whole number solutions or not. The growing belief was that no so such method was possible yet the question remained, how could you prove that, no matter how ingenious you were, you would never come up with such a method. He mentions [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]]. To answer this [[Julia Robinson]], who created the [[Julia Robinson#Hilbert's tenth problem|Robinson Hypothesis]] which stated that to show that there was no such method all you had to do was cook up one equation whose solutions were a very specific set of numbers: The set of numbers needed to grow exponentially yet still be captured by the equations at the heart of Hilbert's problem. Robinson was unable to find this set. This part of the solution fell to [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] who saw how to capture the [[Fibonacci sequence]] using the equations at the heart of Hilbert's tenth.&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

===Algebraic geometry===
The final section briefly covers [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Évariste Galois]] had refined a new language for mathematics. Galois believed  mathematics should be the study of structure as opposed to number and shape. Galois had discovered new techniques to tell whether certain equations could have solutions or not. The symmetry of certain geometric objects was the key. Galois' work was picked up by [[André Weil]] who built algebraic geometry, a whole new language. Weil's work connected [[number theory]], algebra, topology and geometry.

Finally du Sautoy mentions Weil's part in the creation of the fictional mathematician [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] and another contributor to Bourbaki's output - [[Alexander Grothendieck]].&lt;ref name = Ep4/&gt;

'''Ulam's game''', or the '''Rényi–Ulam game''', is a mathematical game similar to the popular game of [[twenty questions]] where one attempts to guess an unnamed object with [[yes–no question]]s, but where some of the answers may be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Play Ulam's Game|url=http://math.iit.edu/~rellis/papers/9how.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{harvs|txt|first=Alfréd|last=Rényi|authorlink=Alfréd Rényi|year=1961}} introduced the game, though his paper was overlooked for many years. Rényi [69] reported the following story about the Jew [[Bar Kochba]] in 135&amp;nbsp;CE, who defended his fortress against the Romans. It is also said that Bar Kochba sent out a scout to the Roman camp who was captured and tortured, having his tongue cut out. He escaped from captivity and reported back to Bar Kochba, but being unable to talk, he could not tell in words what he had seen. Bar Kochba accordingly asked him questions which he could answer by nodding or shaking his head. Thus he acquired from his mute scout the information he needed to defend the fortress. {{harvs|txt|first=Stanislaw|last=Ulam|authorlink=Stanislaw Ulam|year=1976|loc=p. 281}} rediscovered the game, presenting the idea that there are a million objects and the answer to one question can be wrong. {{harvtxt|Pelc|2002}} gave a survey of similar games and their relation to [[information theory]].

Huber, and B.E. Vieux, 2008, Hydrology and Floodplain Analysis, Fourth Edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 795 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; V''flo'' employs [[GIS]] maps for parameterization via a desktop interface.&lt;ref&gt;Vieux, B.E., Z. Cui, and A. Gaur, 2004, Evaluation of a physics-based distributed hydrologic model for flood forecasting. ''J. Hydrol.'', '''298'''(1-4): 155-177. DMIP special issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  The model is suited for [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and in continuous operations.  V''flo'' output is in the form of [[hydrograph]]s at selected [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]] grids, as well as [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] runoff maps covering the watershed. Model applications include civil [[infrastructure]] operations and maintenance, [[stormwater]] prediction and [[emergency management]], continuous and short-term surface water [[runoff model (reservoir)|runoff]], recharge estimation, [[soil moisture]] monitoring, [[land use]] planning, [[water quality]] monitoring, and water resources management.

== History ==
V''flo'' considers the spatial character of the [[parameter]]s and precipitation controlling hydrologic processes, and thus improves upon lumped representations previously used in [[Hydrological modelling|hydrologic modeling]].  Historical practice has been to use lumped representations because of computational limitations or because sufficient data was not available to populate a [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] model database.&lt;ref&gt;Desconnets, J.-C., B.E. Vieux, B. Cappelaere, and F. Delclaux (1996), “A GIS for hydrologic modeling in the semi-arid, HAPEX-Sahel experiment area of Niger Africa.” ''Trans. in GIS'', '''1'''(2): 82-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advances in [[computation]]al speed; development of high-resolution precipitation data from [[weather radar|radar]] and satellites; and availability of worldwide digital data sets and [[GIS]] technology makes distributed, physics-based modeling possible.&lt;ref&gt;ASCE, 1999, ''GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed'', Report, ASCE Task Committee, GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed, P.A. DeBarry, R.G. Quimpo, eds., American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA., p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  V''flo'' is designed to take advantage of the spatial variability of high resolution [[Weather radar|radar rainfall]] input, [[GIS]] datasets, and hydraulic channel characteristics.  Because it is [[physics]]-based, it produces [[hydrograph]]s based on conservation equations and the hydraulics of the [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]], and can be employed in locations where there are no [[rain gauge]]s or previous modeling studies.  In addition, V''flo''’s network approach makes models scalable from upland [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] to river basins using the same [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]].

== Formulation ==
V''flo'' is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and continuous operations.  V''flo'' models may be [[calibration|calibrated]] by loading precipitation maps for historical events and comparing simulated volume/peak [[hydrograph]]s to observed hydrographs.  Elevation data are taken from a [[digital elevation model]].  A vector channel representation is employed.  Parameterization utilizes digital data sets at any resolution, including [[LIDAR]] terrain data and other digital maps of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impervious area]], soils, and land use/cover.  V''flo'' is developed to utilize multi-sensor inputs from [[Weather radar|radar]], satellites, [[rain gauge]]s, or model forecasts.  The kinematic wave analogy is used to represent hydraulic conditions in a [[Drainage basin|watershed]].

'''Vladimir Nikolaevich Burkov''' is a Russian control theorist and the author of more than four hundred publications on control problems, game theory, and combinatorial optimization. Laureate of [[State Prize of USSR]], of Prize of Cabinet Council of USSR, he is a [[Honorary titles of Russia|Honoured Scholar of the Russian Federation]]. Vladimir Burkov is a vice-president of Russian Project Management Association (SOVNET) (the Russian branch of International Project Management Association, IPMA), Member of [[Russian Academy of Natural Sciences]]. A professor at [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] and Head of Laboratory at V.A. Trapeznikov Institute of Control Sciences of RAS, in the end of 1960s he pioneered the theory of active systems (which was a Soviet version of the theory of [[mechanism design]]).

== Biography ==
Vladimir Burkov was born on November 17, 1939, in the city of [[Vologda]]. In 1963 he graduated from the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)]] and was employed by Institute of Automation and Remote Control (since 1970s it is known as ICS RAS, V.A. Trapeznikov Institute of Control Sciences of RAS), where he earned his [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree in 1966, and became [[Doctor of Sciences]] in 1975. In 1981 he earned professorship at the Chair of Control Sciences at [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|MIPT]] and since 1974 he works as a Head of Laboratory 57 (Laboratory of active systems) at ICS RAS.

Married to Elena Burkova, the couple has a daughter Irina, who also earned the doctoral degree for her contributions to control theory.

== Contributions to combinatory optimization and project scheduling ==
Early academic interests of Vladimir Burkov were connected with applied problems of [[combinatorial optimization]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mtas.ru/search/search_results.php?publication_id=1444|title=Combinatorics and technical progress (Комбинаторика и развитие техники)|first=|publisher=Znaniye (Знание)|year=1968|isbn=|edition=|series=|volume=|location=Moscow (Москва)|page=|pages=|at=|language=Russian|chapter=|format=|quote=|ref=|orig-year=|chapter-url=|via=|issue=|author=Burkov V.N., Lovetsky S.E.

== Launching theory of active systems ==
Since late 1960s interests of Vladimir Burkov shift to the studies of specific nature of human being as a controlled object (an agent). In 1969 he pursued an idea of the "''fairplay principle''" (in Russian: принцип открытого управления): plans assigned to selfish agents by the optimal control mechanism must be coordinated with agents' goal functions. Under such an [[incentive-compatible]] mechanism truthtelling is benefitiary for agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burkov|first=V.N.|last2=Lerner|first2=A.Ya.|year=1970|title=Open control principle for active systems|url=https://zbmath.org/?q=an:0218.93003|journal=Avtomat. i Telemekh.|volume=8|pages=100–111|via=ZentralMATH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Burkov V.N., Lerner A.Ya. | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url = http://www.mtas.ru/search/search_results.php?publication_id=856 | title = Fairplay in control of active systems | orig-year = | agency = H.

They pioneered the [[revelation principle]], which opened a new era in the studies of economic institutions ([[mechanism design]] and [[contract theory]]); it was mentioned as the main achievement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2007/advanced-economicsciences2007.pdf|title=Mechanism Design Theory: Scientific background on the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2007|last=Compiled by the Prize Committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007s [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] won by [[Leonid Hurwicz|L.

The fairplay principle became the foundation of the newly introduced ''theory of active systems'' (a version of mechanism design originated from USSR), which systematically studied control mechanisms in man-machine systems.

== Organizational and teaching activities ==
In 1973 V. Burkov headed the newly created division in the Institute of Automation and Remote Control called "the Sector of Business Games"; in 1974 it was re-organized into the Laboratory 57 "Theory and methods of business games" later renamed to "Laboratory of Active Systems". As of the end of 2016 its headcount is 28 employees including 15 [[Doctor of Sciences|Doctors of Sciences]] and 5 [[Candidate of Sciences|Candidates of Sciences]]. During the decades V. Burkov superwised dozens of thesis works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mtas.ru/users/chart/|title=Interactive tree of the Theory of Active Systems|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=|author=|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Warsaw School of Mathematics''' is the name given to a group of [[mathematician]]s who worked at [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], in the two decades between the World Wars, especially in the fields of [[logic]], [[set theory]], [[point-set topology]] and [[real analysis]]. They published in the journal ''[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]]'', founded in 1920—one of the world's first specialist [[mathematics journal|pure-mathematics journals]]. It was in this journal, in 1933, that [[Alfred Tarski]]—whose illustrious career would a few years later take him to the [[University of California, Berkeley]]—published his celebrated theorem on the [[undefinability of the notion of truth]].

Notable members of the Warsaw School of Mathematics have included:
* [[Wacław Sierpiński]]
* [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]
* [[Edward Marczewski]]
* [[Bronisław Knaster]]
* [[Zygmunt Janiszewski]]
* [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]]
* [[Stanisław Saks]]
* [[Karol Borsuk]]
* [[Roman Sikorski]]
* [[Nachman Aronszajn]]
* [[Samuel Eilenberg]]

Additionally, notable logicians of the [[Lwów-Warsaw School of Logic]], working at [[Warsaw]], have included:
* [[Stanisław Leśniewski]]
* [[Adolf Lindenbaum]]
* [[Alfred Tarski]]
* [[Jan Łukasiewicz]]
* [[Andrzej Mostowski]]
* [[Helena Rasiowa]]

Fourier analysis has been advanced at [[Warsaw]] by:
* [[Aleksander Rajchman]]
* [[Antoni Zygmund]]
* [[Józef Marcinkiewicz]]
* [[Otton M. Nikodym]]
* [[Jerzy Spława-Neyman]]

In mathematics, the '''''Zahlbericht''''' (number report) was a report on [[algebraic number theory]] by {{harvs|txt|last=Hilbert|authorlink=David Hilbert|year1=1897|year2=1998|loc2=(English translation)}}.

==History==
In 1893 the German mathematical society invited Hilbert and [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]] to write reports on the theory of numbers. They agreed that Minkowski would cover the more elementary parts of number theory while Hilbert would cover algebraic number theory. Minkowski eventually abandoned his report, while Hilbert's report was published in 1897. It was reprinted in volume 1 of his collected works, and republished in an English translation in 1998.
{{harvtxt|Corry|1996}} and {{harvtxt|Schappacher|2005}} and the English introduction to {{harv|Hilbert|1998}} give detailed discussions of the history and influence of Hilbert's ''Zahlbericht''. 

Some earlier reports on number theory include the report by [[H. J. S. Smith]] in 6 parts between 1859 and 1865, reprinted in {{harvtxt|Smith|1965}}, and the report by {{harvtxt|Brill|Noether|1894}}. {{harvs|txt|last=Hasse|year1=1926|year2=1927|year3=1930}} wrote an update of Hilbert's Zahlbericht that covered [[class field theory]] (republished in 1 volume as {{harv|Hasse|1970}}).

==Contents==
Part 1 covers the theory of general [[number field]]s, including ideals, [[discriminant]]s, differents, units, and ideal classes. 

Part 2 covers [[Galois extension|Galois number field]]s, including in particular [[Hilbert's theorem 90]].

Part 3 covers [[quadratic number field]]s, including the theory of genera, and [[Ideal class group|class number]]s of quadratic fields.

Part 4 covers [[cyclotomic field]]s, including the [[Kronecker–Weber theorem]] (theorem 131), the [[Hilbert–Speiser theorem]] (theorem 132), and the [[Eisenstein reciprocity law]] for ''l''th power residues (theorem 140) .

Part 5 covers [[Kummer extension|Kummer number fields]], and ends with Kummer's proof of Fermat's last theorem for [[regular prime]]s.
