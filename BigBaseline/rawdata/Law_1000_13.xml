==History==
The use of an advisory jury is derived from the practice of the [[Court of Chancery]] of referring [[issues of fact]] to one of the [[Common Law]] Courts of [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]] be tried by a [[jury]] as a ''feigned issue''. The ''feigned issue'' was to inform the conscience of the court, and could be disregarded by the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]]. The ''feigned issue'' was a legal fiction by stating that a wager contract was laid between two parties interested in respectively maintaining the affirmative and the negative of certain propositions. The [[Gaming Act 1845]] section 19 abolished the ''feigned issue'' and provided that the issue should the directly state the question of fact in dispute instead of a wager. The same abolition occurred in [[New York (state)|New York]] by section 72 of the [[Field Code]] in 1850.
In Watt v Starke {{ussc|101|247}} (1879) the [[United States Supreme Court]] stated "the verdict of a jury upon an issue out of chancery is only advisory." [[Federal Equity Rules|Federal Equity Rule]] 23, effective 1913, provides in an equity case when a question arises that is triable by jury, a jury trial is held on the equity side without transfer to the law side of the [[United States District Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Colleton Merc. Mfg. Co. v. Savannah River Lumber Co., 280 Fed. 358 (C.C.A.4th, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 [[Federal Rule of Civil Procedure]] 39(c)(1) authorized the in any action not triable of right by a jury the court on motion or on its own may have any issue tried by an advisory jury.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">'''Ambulance chasing''', sometimes known as  '''[[Barratry (common law)|barratry]]''', is a professional slur which refers to a lawyer soliciting for clients at a disaster site. The term "ambulance chasing" comes from the stereotype of lawyers that follow ambulances to the emergency room to find clients.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Garner | first1 = Bryan A. | title = Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage | edition = 3 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-19-538420-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''ambulance chaser'' is also used more loosely as a derogatory term for a [[personal injury lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ambulance+chaser |title=Ambulance Chaser |publisher=The Free Dictionary |accessdate=2017-09-04 |quote=A lawyer who is eager to bring personal injury lawsuits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Ambulance chasing is prohibited in the United States. Such conduct violates Rule 7.3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_7_3.html Model Rules of Professional Conduct - Rule 7.3 Direct Contact With Prospective Clients - Center for Professional Responsibility&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].  Some [[bar associations]] strongly enforce rules against barratry.  For example, the [[State Bar of California]] dispatches investigators to large-scale disaster scenes to discourage ambulance chasers, and to catch any who attempt to solicit business from disaster victims at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy McCarthy, [http://archive.calbar.ca.gov/Archive.aspx?articleId=61497&amp;categoryId=61298&amp;month=3&amp;year=2005 "Public protection takes center stage in disaster"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811174430/http://archive.calbar.ca.gov/Archive.aspx?articleId=61497&amp;categoryId=61298&amp;month=3&amp;year=2005 |date=2011-08-11 }}, ''State Bar Journal'', March 2005, pages unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambulance chasing is also illegal in Australia, in accordance with clauses 20 and 22 of the Legal Profession Regulation of 1987.

In the UK, Indicative Behaviour (IB) 8.5 of the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] Code of Conduct 2011 specifies that "approaching people in the street, at ports of entry, in hospital or at the scene of an accident" is to be taken as an indication of non-compliance with the SRA Principles. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/code/content.page&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8587">'''Asymmetric negotiation''' is influence that occurs between counterparts of significantly different sizes as measured by the parties’ relative resources and clout in a particular context. The context for these negotiations or conflicts can range from mergers &amp; acquisitions and international trade deals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pretsch|first=Frank|last2=Landau|first2=Alice|title=Symmetry and Asymmetry in International Negotiations|url=https://eduedi.dongguk.edu/files/20070519075111526.pdf|journal=International Negotiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to hostage-takings and initiating change at a local school board. 

A larger party in one context can be a smaller party in another. For instance, a US corporation may be a much larger buyer in an asymmetric negotiation with a North American supplier, while reduced to being a relatively small player overseas in negotiations with the [[European Union]] where it has fewer resources and less clout. 

Just as in [[asymmetric warfare]], research has shown that smaller players can prevail in getting what they want from much larger players by applying distinct approaches, strategies and tactics that increase their odds of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://negotiatingwithgiants.com|title=Negotiating with Giants|last=Johnston|first=Peter D.|publisher=Negotiation Press|year=2008|isbn=0980942101|location=United States|pages=1-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This specific form of negotiation contrasts with symmetrical or standard negotiations where the parties are more similar in size.

== History ==
Given the growing number of large corporations and government entities worldwide, and the corresponding growth in asymmetric negotiations, this phenomenon has received increasing attention in recent decades, with numerous journalists and academics addressing the subject in articles and journals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21707210-rise-corporate-colossus-threatens-both-competition-and-legitimacy-business|title=In the shadow of giants|last=|first=|date=|work=The Economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haber|first=Lawerence J.|date=Summer 2006|title=Labor Negotiations and Game Theory: The Case of Asymmetric Bargaining Power|url=http://klasrum.weebly.com/uploads/9/0/9/1/9091667/labor_negotiations.pdf|journal=Journal of Collective Negotiations|volume=|pages=|via=Indiana-Purdue University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanitsky|first=Nicholai|date=November 19, 2014|title=Asymmetric negotiations: a journey in unchartered Waters|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141119083842-182746213-asymmetric-negotiations-a-journey-in-uncharted-waters|journal=Global Intermediate Storage Systems|volume=|pages=|via=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;. International negotiator [[Peter D. Johnston]]’s book ''Negotiating with Giants'' provides an in-depth survey of “size-imbalanced” negotiations. In this 2008 book, Johnston studied more than 100 negotiations from across history to the present day, where smaller players got what they wanted from much larger players, with the author identifying unique strategies that worked for these “Davids” in their negotiations with wide-ranging giants or “Goliaths.” 

== Asymmetric strategies for smaller players ==
According to Johnston, successful smaller players should change the game on their larger counterparts by using seven distinct approaches given the unique challenges they face in asymmetric negotiations:
#  They should defend themselves from the start, earlier than one might normally expect, including defenses for their reputations, ideas and information to ensure that hurting them won’t be as easy as it could be otherwise.
#  They should negotiate away from the negotiation table as long as possible to even the playing field with larger counterparts, making themselves bigger and stronger before meeting face-to-face—if and only if that is ever required.
#  They should draw on seven different types of “helpers” that smaller players across history have employed to their benefit: Decision-makers, Influencers, Arm-Twisters, Networkers, Allies, Counselors and Informants.
#  They should find rules and laws to undermine larger players&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Robert S.|last2=Silverstein|first2=Elliot M.|date=Spring 2000|title=When David Meets Goliath: Dealing with Power Differentials in Negotiations|url=http://www.hnlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WHEN_DAVID_MEETS_GOLIATH_DEALING_WITH_POWER_DIFFERENTIALS_IN_NEGOTIATIONS.doc|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, join them to weaken them from the inside, or remove key assets that contribute to their strengths.
#  They should act unilaterally and unpredictably when it meets their interests, using their smaller size to react swiftly and catch their giants flat-footed, often by pursuing their back-up plans.
#  They should weave together their different negotiations and operating decisions to maximize value in any single negotiation, a strategy referred to by the author as "integrated negotiation".
#  They should think differently about building rapport and trust, focusing on positives that connect them to their giants, modeling desired behaviors, building trust incrementally, and redefining trust by knowing that they can always trust larger players will act consistent with what they perceive to be in their own best interests.

== Historical examples ==
* [[Magna Carta]], the Barons and King John. In 1215, Magna Carta, Europe’s first written constitution guaranteeing basic rights for citizens, was agreed to by King John, but only after the land-owning Barons weakened the Monarch by claiming London as their own. The Barons would only relinquish control of the city once they saw that the Crown had followed through on its commitments related to Magna Carta.
* [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and the [[abolition of slavery in the United States]]. As a housewife and abolitionist in 1851, Stowe wrote the novel ''[[Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'', drawing attention to the evils of slavery. The book, second only to the Bible in worldwide readership by the end of the 1800s, helped forge a broad coalition of abolitionists, enabling Stowe to influence the creation of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the choice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as president, and ultimately, the end of slavery in the United States.
* [[Rachel Carson]] and the [[environmental movement]]. In the 1950s, the scientist uncovered troubling links between bird deaths and pesticides, soon linking cancer to chemical usage and building a coalition of environmentalists through her non-fiction bestselling book, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. Her influence helped lead to the banning of [[DDT]], the establishment of America’s [[Environmental Protection Agency]], and the early development of the environmental movement itself. 

== Contemporary examples ==
* The 1989 [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] between Canada and the United States. Rather than continuing to negotiate a series of smaller bilateral trade deals by sector, Canada at one-tenth the size of America, reached a wide-ranging trade agreement. The deal was large enough to attract the attention of its southern neighbor, while valuable enough to the Americans to ensure Canada could also negotiate important protections for its culture, healthcare and education.
* ''[[Friends]]'', [[Warner Brothers]], and [[Courteney Cox|Courtney Cox]]. When the ''Friends'' television show quickly became a sensation in the mid-1990s, Cox (Monica), the highest profile member of the cast at the time, could have easily commanded the largest salary increase for herself. Instead, she rallied [[David Schwimmer]] (Ross) and their other four main cast members into a coalition to negotiate as one with more collective clout. This led to the same immediate financial gains for each actor, culminating in each actor being paid $1 million per episode by the end of the show’s run in 2004.
* [[Ashley Smith (author)|Ashley Smith]] and hostage-taker [[Brian Nichols]]. In March 2005, Smith was taken hostage by Nichols in her Atlanta apartment, and managed in fewer than eight hours to build rapport, trust and mutual understanding with the armed killer, reading excerpts from [[The Purpose-Driven Life]] and the Bible, before he let her go unscathed. She was later one of the key witnesses against Nichols, who was found guilty of a range of crimes and sentenced to multiple life sentences.

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}
The term ''basic law'' is used in some places as an alternative to "[[constitution]]", implying it is a ''temporary but necessary measure'' without formal enactment of constitution. A basic law is either a [[codified constitution]], or in countries with [[uncodified constitution]]s, a law given to have constitution powers and effect. The name is usually used to imply an interim or transitory nature, or avoid attempting a claim to being "the highest law", often for religious reasons. In [[West Germany]] the term "[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]" (''Grundgesetz'') was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate [[reunification of Germany]]. But in 1990 no new constitution was adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory. Basic law is entrenched in that it overrides ordinary 'statute law' passed by the legislature.

The [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]], namely [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have basic laws as their constitutional documents. The basic laws are the highest authority, respectively, in the territories, while the rights of amendment and interpretation rest with the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China]].

==Post Democracy==

Crouch coined the term "[[post-democracy]]" in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that are conducted by fully operating [[Democracy|democratic system]]s (elections are being held, governments fall and there is [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is making the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;Colin Crouch. [http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''. The term appeared to define a running evolution within democracies during the 21st century and is [[polemic]]al because it calls attention to recognized democracies losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In ancient British customs, '''Conservators of the Peace''' ([[Latin]]: ''Custodes pacis''), or '''Wardens of the Peace''', were individuals who had a special charge, by virtue of their office, to see that the [[Anglo-Saxon law|King's peace]] was kept.

Until the creation of the [[Justices of the Peace]] by [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], there were several people, who by common law were interested in keeping the same&amp;mdash;some having that charge as incident to other offices; others simply, or of itself, called ''custodes'', or ''Conservators of the Peace''.

More recently, the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of [[Chester]] was a Conservator in the county of Cheshire; and petty constables are, by the common law, conservators in the first sense.

The Conservator of the Peace title is still used in the USA. For example, in Virginia, Special Conservators of the Peace upon a showing by the applicant of a necessity for the security of property or the peace and presentation of evidence that the person or persons to be appointed as a special conservator of the peace possess a valid registration issued by the Department of Criminal Justice Services. The order of appointment shall provide that a special conservator of the peace may perform only the duties for which he is qualified by training as established by the Criminal Justice Services Board. The order of appointment shall provide that such duties shall be exercised only within geographical limitations specified by the court, which shall be within the confines of the county, city or town that makes application or on the real property where the corporate applicant is located, or any real property contiguous to such real property. The order may provide that the special conservator of the peace shall have the authority to make an arrest outside of such geographical limitations if the arrest results from a close pursuit that was initiated when the special conservator of the peace was within the confines of the area wherein he has been authorized to have the powers and authority of a special conservator of the peace; the order shall further delineate a geographical limitation or distance beyond which the special conservator of the peace may not effectuate such an arrest that follows from a close pursuit. The order may also provide that a special conservator of the peace who has completed the minimum training standards established by the Criminal Justice Services Board, has the authority to affect arrests, using up to the same amount of force as would be allowed to a law-enforcement officer employed by the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions when making a lawful arrest. No special conservator of the peace shall display or use the word "police" on any uniform, badge, credential, or vehicle in the performance of his duties as a special conservator of the peace. Other than special conservators of the peace employed by a state agency, no special conservator of the peace shall use the seal of the Commonwealth on any uniform, badge, credential, or vehicle in the performance of his duties.

'''Sarajevo Summer Law School''' is a project organized by the [[European Law Students' Association]] (ELSA) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

[http://www.summerschoolsineurope.eu/course/4423/media-law-and-role-of-media-in-armed-conflicts]
ELSA summer law schools are organized like seven-day international schools on certain topics in science domains, guided by ideas which are helpful to youth in their academic, but in business upgrade too.

== Idea of project ==

Idea about the project of Sarajevo Summer Law School comes from Darko Dizdarević who was Vice President S&amp;C of ELSA B&amp;H at the moment of its foundation in 2013. The purpose is to expand the knowledge in the area of law through lectures of recognized experts and to gather students from different countries in Europe to exchange their opinions and to create effective network.

== Founders ==

Beside Darko, other founders of Sarajevo Summer Law School are: Nihad Odobašić, Mirza Hebib, Harun Išerić, Amina Mašović, Enida Šačirović, Ana-Maria Paponja, Nasir Muftić, Ajdina Batalović, Emina Agić, Muhamed Tulić.

[http://www.summerschoolsineurope.eu/course/4423/media-law-and-role-of-media-in-armed-conflicts]
Main ideas which characterize this project are knowledge expansion of students about certain law theme which is a base of entire project, education and progressional upgrade of students who participate in project, linking, at the same time, students from all over Europe because of networking as the main goal. ELSA summer law schools are held in summer, and gather approximately 40-50 participants. Inspired by this, ELSA B&amp;H decided to start this unique project, with aim to give unique opportunity to law students from B&amp;H and the other starters across Europe who are going to participate in this project, then to increase academic standard in B&amp;H which did not include an opportunity of additional education on this way, and to improve reputation, structure and organization of ELSA B&amp;H.

== First Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

Lectures in Sarajevo, Municipality of Old Town.jpg |thumb| Lectures in Sarajevo, Municipality of Old Town, 2013, academic program
In 2014, ELSA Bosnia and Herzegovina organized the first Summer Law School on the topic ''Media Law and International Standards on Information Access''. This school was the first law school of this type organized by students in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The idea for this project was created as a result of the need of a detailed and clear proposal solutions of unarranged domain access to information and abuse of media rights to the detriment of conscientious citizens.The school attracted around 40 students from 15 different countries, who had lectures for seven days (7–14 August) at the School of Economics and Business in Sarajevo. Recognized lecturers and experts such as: MSc Dunja Mijatović (The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media), MSc Amer Džihana (Internews BiH), MSc Kristina Ćendić (Internews BiH), Helena Mandić (Communications Regulatory Agency B&amp;H), DSc Marco Bellezza (Associate at Portolano Cavallo Studio Legale), DSc Oreste Pollicino (Bocconi University) and Anja Gengo (University of Sarajevo) attended.

The announcement of the first Sarajevo Summer Law School and promotion of signing a memorandum of cooperation with institutions and non-governmental
organizations were reported by many media in B&amp;H of which is important to mention the state television ˝TV Sarajevo˝ and ˝Hayat TV˝ with contributions in television shows about school, radio station ˝Antena Sarajevo˝ with contribution in a radio show and ˝Dnevni Avaz˝ as a written media. During the lasting of the seven-day school, the following media were reporting : ˝Antena Sarajevo˝, ˝RSG Radio˝, ˝Klix.ba˝, ˝Fena TV˝, ˝TV Sarajevo˝, ˝Ekskluziva.ba˝, and many web portals of student organizations and civil society organizations.

== Second Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

After success of the first school, ELSA Bosnia and Herzegovina organized second Summer Law School in July 2015 on the topic " [http://sarajevosls.ba/?p=205 Media Law and Role of Media in Armed Conflicts "]. The focus remains on the field of Media Law, since this domain was highlighted as a focus programme of the ELSA International.

In existence and development of free democratic society media has an important role. Its original role as a mere transmitter of information in modern society is outdated. The formation of public opinion is considerably dependent on both the monitoring of information and its presentation in public. Growing power of media is evident and it reveals series of sensitive questions about legislation, such as freedom of expression, the right to information, the right to privacy, the right to honor and reputation, intellectual property rights, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Topic|url = http://sarajevosls.ba/?page_id=79|website = Sarajevo Summer Law School|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US|last = elsasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media law as a contemporary branch of law consolidates a large number of areas of law with radio and television, printed media, Internet and on-line services, various forms of entertainment, advertisements and marketing, as the subject to regulation. The interest of authority in this branch of law is significant since the trust and support of public are based on transparency and openness of decision-making process, which is provided by media. The topic of media law is very important and sensitive topic which is one of the reasons of it being selected as the topic of second Sarajevo Summer Law School. The biggest advantage of virtual communication is reflected in the two-way interactive communication, thus enabling denial of incorrect information. Another inevitable media is social media, a product of [[web 2.0]] , which accomplishes a complete democratization of data and information publishing. Nowadays, through social media people have the opportunity to globally affect messages, publish their attitudes, opinions and ideas. Information provided by these sites have had a significant role in the activism in recent years. The best example for that is [[Arab Spring]] in which these social media were used as the key tool for mobilization, training, forming the opinion and affecting the change. Despite the censorship of media and the fact that the national television was not reporting anything about what was happening, amateur footage of the first riots in Tunisia got on the Internet. Thereby, the whole world was informed about the course of these events, and citizens realized they can turn the power to their advantage. People of the Arab world understood that they are not alone, that there are others going through the same suffering and brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Topic|url = http://sarajevosls.ba/?page_id=79|website = Sarajevo Summer Law School|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US|last = elsasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 45 participants not only from Europe, second Sarajevo Summer Law School has grown in one of the most recognized schools in ELSA network, since our law school is one of the 36 law schools under ELSA organisation. The School was honored with presence of highly experts in this field: DSc Vladimir Bratić (Hollins University, USA), MSc Stana Tadić (Humanitarian Law Centre Belgrade), Nedžad Smailagić (Poitiers University, France), MSc Amer Džihana (Internews BiH), MSc Kristina Ćendić (Internews BiH), Nihad Kreševljaković (Sarajevo War Theatre) and Asja Rokša – Zubčević (Communications Regulatory Agency BiH).

Also, the appearance, structure and organization of ELSA B&amp;H are improved through this project, and there is expressed desire and need for the establishment of the Institute of Media Law and the study of Media Law in the frame of the regular curriculum at the Law Faculty in Sarajevo, and to the general public we enabled information about the protection of the rights of the injured through the media, which is extremely necessary for creating a democratic state.

== Third Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

After very successful second Sarajevo Summer Law School, in the summer of 2016. tradition is continued and the third Sarajevo Summer Law School is going to be organized. This year's summer school topic will be completely different from the topics discussed from previous two years.  
This year’s theme is "''Freedom of Religion in Europe''". Freedom of religion is considered by many people and nations to be a fundamental human right. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.

{{Environmental law}}
'''Earth jurisprudence''' is a philosophy of [[law]] and [[human]] [[Government|governance]] that is based on the idea that humans are only one part of a wider community of beings and that the welfare of each member of that community is dependent on the welfare of the [[Earth]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="center"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Law center's first case: Saving the planet |url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/MiamiHerald/2006/05/14/1557834?extID=10051 |journal=[[Miami Herald]] |date=May 14, 2006 |quote=Earth Jurisprudence is premised on the concept that Law and governance is meant to protect the well-being of the planet and all components of the Earth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922014545/http://www.mywire.com/pubs/MiamiHerald/2006/05/14/1557834?extID=10051 |archivedate=September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovering the meaning of Earth jurisprudence|publisher= Legalbrief |url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=2002082769459999|date= August 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that [[Society|human societies]] will only be viable and flourish if they regulate themselves as part of this wider Earth community and do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental laws or principles that govern how the [[universe]] functions, which is the ‘Great Jurisprudence’.

Earth jurisprudence can be differentiated from the Great jurisprudence, but can also be understood as being embedded within it. Earth jurisprudence can be seen as a special case of the Great Jurisprudence, applying universal principles to the governmental, societal and biological processes of Earth.

Earth jurisprudence seeks to expand our understanding of the relevance of governance beyond humanity to the whole Earth community, it is Earth-centric rather than [[anthropocentric]]. It is concerned with the maintenance and regulation of relations between all members of the Earth community, not just between human beings. Earth jurisprudence is intended to provide a philosophical basis for the development and implementation of human governance systems, which may include [[ethics]], [[law]]s, institutions, policies and practices. It also places an emphasis on the internalisation of these insights and on personal practice, in living in accordance with Earth jurisprudence as a way of life.

Earth jurisprudence should reflect a particular human community's understanding of how to regulate itself as part of the Earth community and should express the qualities of the Great jurisprudence of which it forms part. The specific applications of Earth jurisprudence will vary from society to society, while sharing common elements. These elements include:

*a recognition that any Earth jurisprudence exists within a wider context that shapes it and influences how it functions;
*a recognition that the universe is the source of the fundamental ‘Earth rights’ of all members of the Earth community, rather than some part of the human governance system and accordingly these rights cannot be validly circumscribed or abrogated by human jurisprudence;
*a means of recognising the roles and ‘rights’ of non-human members of the Earth community and of restraining humans from unjustifiably preventing them fulfilling those roles; 
*a concern for reciprocity and the maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between all the members of the Earth community determined by what is best for the system as a whole (Earth justice); and
*an approach to condoning or disapproving human conduct on the basis of whether or not the conduct strengthens or weakens the bonds that constitute the Earth community.

== History ==
The need for a new jurisprudence was first identified by [[Thomas Berry]] who identified the destructive [[anthropocentrism]] on which existing legal and political structures are based as a major impediment to the necessary transition to an ecological age in which humans would seek a new intimacy with the integral functioning of the natural world.

The feasibility of developing this jurisprudence (by then provisionally referred to as ‘Earth jurisprudence’) was discussed at meeting attended by Berry in April 2001, organised by the Gaia Foundation in London at the Airlie Conference Center outside [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. A group of people involved in the law and with indigenous peoples came together from South Africa, Britain, Colombia, Canada and the United States. (See 'Thomas Berry and an Earth Jurisprudence: An Exploratory Essay', by Mike Bell, ''The Trumpeter'', Vol. 19, no. 1 (2003)).  

The first detailed exploration of Earth jurisprudence in print and the introduction of the term ‘Great Jurisprudence’ occurred with the first publication of [[Wild Law (book)|''Wild Law'']] by [[Cormac Cullinan]], launched at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in [[Cape Town]] 2002.

2004 workshop
 
April 2004, first UK workshop held to discuss and develop the principles of Earth jurisprudence, titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023233/http://www.peoplesearthdecade.org/events/calendar.php?event_id=285 'Wild Law Wilderness Workshop: A Walking Workshop on Earth Jurisprudence'].  Donald Reid (former chairman of UKELA, the UK Environmental Law Association) and Cormac Cullinan (author of [[Wild Law (book)|''Wild Law'']]) lead the workshop in the Knoydart Peninsula (one of the last true wilderness areas in the Scotland).

The feasibility of developing a new form of [[jurisprudence]] was discussed at a conference in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] attended by Thomas Berry in April 2001, organised by the Gaia Foundation. A group of people involved with law and indigenous peoples attended from South Africa, Britain, Colombia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thomas Berry and an Earth Jurisprudence: An Exploratory Essay|url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/106/110|author=Mike Bell|publisher=The Trumpeter|volume=19|issue= 1|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the first Center for Earth Jurisprudence established in Florida. The mission of the Centre, which is co-sponsored by Barry and St. Thomas Universities, Florida, is to re-envision law and governance in ways that support the well being of the Earth community as a whole. This involves fostering mutually enhancing relationships among humans and nature and recognition of the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt;

Earth jurisprudence UK conference held in November 2006, 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law'. Based on the book ''Wild Law'' by Cormac Cullinan.  Held at the University of Brighton and organised jointly by UKELA and ELF. Chaired by John Elkington (of SustainAbility and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, [[Norman Baker]] MP (former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Environment Spokesman), [[Satish Kumar]] (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).

EARTH JURISPRUDENCE IN AUSTRALIA

Australia has a very active Earth jurisprudence and 'wild law' movement.  The first wild law conference in Australia was held in Adelaide, South Australia in 2009 and a second conference was held in Wollongong, New South Wales, in 2010.  A third Wild Law conference was organised in 2011 in Brisbane, Queensland and at that time a core group of Earth jurisprudence advocates formed the Australian Earth Laws Alliance (www.earthlaws.org.au).  The Australian Earth Laws Alliance is the leading organisation in Australia promoting Earth laws and wild law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6092">The '''Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law''' Moot is an [[moot court|international moot competition]] for young practicing lawyers organised by [[Essex Court Chambers]] and [[Singapore Academy of Law]]. Whereas most moot competitions are only for students still in [[law school]] or who have not been [[bar (law)|called to the bar]], the ECC-SAL Moot is only open to lawyers who have been qualified for practice for no more than three years. The first edition of the moot was held in 2012. The moot is open to lawyers from Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, and South Korea, and is mainly judged by lawyers (including [[Queen's Counsel]] and [[Senior Counsel]]), academics, and judges in the region. It typically involves a commercial dispute between parties before the [[Singapore International Commercial Court]]. The top eight teams that qualify from the preliminary phase (two rounds) proceed to the knockout stages.

'''Freemen-on-the-land''' (also '''freemen-of-the-land''', the '''freemen movement''' or simply '''freemen''') are a loose group of individuals who believe that they are bound by [[statute law]]s only if they consent to those laws. They believe that they can therefore declare themselves independent of the government and the [[rule of law]], holding that the only "true" law is their own interpretation of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freemen movement captures Canadian police attention |last=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/freemen-movement-captures-canadian-police-attention-1.1262159 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date= 29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has been described as a [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Freemen of the dangerous nonsense|url = http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/11/15/freemen-of-the-dangerous-nonsense/|website = UK Human Rights Blog|accessdate = 9 December 2015|first = Adam|last = Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freemen are active in [[English-speaking countries]]: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Stocked, [http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/the-seriously-weird-beliefs-of-freemen-on-the-land/news-story/cd91441f8f406a48457d5450b0a264f9 The seriously weird beliefs of Freemen on the land], ''[[news.com.au]]'', 9 July 2016.

In the Canadian court case ''Meads v. Meads'', [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]] Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke used the phrase "Organised Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA) to describe the techniques and arguments used by freemen in court, describing them as frivolous and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]].&lt;ref name="Wittmeier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|title=Edmonton divorce case prompts justice to dissect "pseudolegal" arguments|last=Wittmeier|first=B|date=27 September 2012|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003034131/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|archivedate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablawg.ca/2012/10/30/the-organized-pseudolegal-commercial-argument-opca-litigant-case/ University of Calgary Faculty of Law]&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/O/OrganizedPseudolegalCommercialArgumentLitigant.aspx Duhaime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meads-canlii /&gt; There is no recorded instance of freeman tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In refuting each of the arguments used by Meads, Rooke concluded that "a decade of reported cases, many of which he refers to in his ruling, have failed to prove a single concept advanced by OPCA litigants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/4463/The-scourge-of-unrepresented-litigants.html ''Canadian Lawyer'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Freemen believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call "common" (case) and "natural" laws. They believe natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use "fraud or mischief" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence: their body and their legal "person". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a "[[Strawman theory|strawman]]" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this "strawman" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name, such as "John of the family Smith" instead of "John Smith".&lt;ref name="Benchmark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131216185721/http://judiciary.sut1.co.uk/docs/benchmark/benchmark_feb2012.pdf "Nonsense or loophole?"], ''Benchmark'', Issue 57, February 2012, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many freemen beliefs are based on idiosyncratic interpretations of [[Admiralty law|admiralty or maritime law]], which the freemen claim govern the commercial world. These beliefs stem from fringe interpretations of various nautical-sounding words, such as ownership, citizenship, dock, or birth (berth) certificate. Freemen refer to the court as a "ship", the court's occupants as "passengers" and may claim that those leaving are "men overboard".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will try to claim common law (as opposed to admiralty law) jurisdiction by asking "Do you have a claim against me?" This, they contend, removes their consent to be governed by admiralty law and turns the court into a common law court, so that proceedings would have to go forward according to their version of common law. This procedure has never been successfully used.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will often not accept legal representation, believing that to do so would mean contracting with the state. They believe that the United Kingdom and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. They believe that since the abolition of the gold standard, UK currency is backed not by gold but by the people (or the "legal fiction of their persons"). They describe persons as creditors of the UK corporation. Therefore, a court is a place of business, and a summons is an invitation to discuss the matter at hand, with no powers to require attendance or compliance.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; They may believe that the government controls secret bank accounts in their name as part of this theory, which may be accessed to pay off debts.

None of the beliefs held by freemen have ever been supported by any judgments or verdicts in any criminal or civil court cases anywhere.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; An [[England and Wales|English]] solicitor, writing anonymously, commented:

{{quote|[This] strategy might give lenders pause, of course, because litigating against awkward characters isn't much fun. But given how flimsy the freeman legal arguments are, the pause needn't be long. I've seen a transcript of a hearing in which a debtor tried to rely on the freeman defence. It was over as soon as the judge asked (I can imagine the withering tone), ''"Are you planning to persist in this defence, Mr Jones?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous|title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 June 2015}} Note: Author name withheld by request; a solicitor of England and Wales; wrote with permission pseudonymously as "Legal Bizzle"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contracts ==
Freemen believe that since they exist in a common law [[jurisdiction]] where equality is paramount and mandatory, the people in the government and courts are not above the law, and that government and court personnel therefore must obtain the [[consent of the governed]]. Freemen believe that government employees who do not obtain consent of the governed have abandoned the rule of law. They believe this consent is routinely secured by way of people submitting applications and through acts of registration. They believe the public servants have deceived the population into abandoning their status as freemen in exchange for the status of a "child of the province" or "ward of the state", allowing those children to collect benefits such as welfare, unemployment insurance, and pension plans or old age security.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Freemen believe that the government has to establish "joinder" to link oneself and one's legal person. If one is asked whether one is "John Smith" and one says that is so, one has established joinder and connected the physical and human persons. The next step is to obtain consent. Statutes are merely invitations to enter a contract, and are only legally enforceable if one enters into the contract consensually. Otherwise, statute laws are not applicable. Freemen believe that the government is constantly trying to trick people into entering into a contract with them, so they often return bills, notices, summons and so on with the message "No contract—return to sender".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

A "notice of understanding and intent and claim of right" is a document used by freemen to declare their sovereignty. The signed document, often [[notarised]], is sent to the Queen and possibly other authorities such as the Prime Minister and police chiefs. It usually begins with the words "Whereas it is my understanding" and goes on to state their understanding of the law and their lack of consent to it.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen's beliefs are based on misunderstandings and wishful thinking and have not been successful in any courts anywhere.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

== Court cases ==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Meads v. Meads]] --&gt;
*Dennis Larry Meads of [[Edmonton]], Alberta, stormed out of a hearing in the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]] on 8 June 2012, related to his divorce and matrimonial property case. In response, Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke wrote a lengthy and comprehensive 185-page judgment rejecting various freemen claims, grouping them with other pseudolegal arguments as "Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA), specifically, in this case, Meads' freeman on the land claims, arguments and documents, saying that:&lt;ref name="Wittmeier" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bluntly idiotic substance of Mr. Mead's argument explains the unnecessarily complicated manner in which it was presented. OPCA arguments are never sold to their customers as simple ideas, but instead are byzantine schemes which more closely resemble the plot of a dark fantasy novel than anything else. Latin maxims and powerful sounding language are often used. Documents are often ornamented with many strange markings and seals. Litigants engage in peculiar, ritual‑like in court conduct. All these features appear necessary for gurus to market OPCA schemes to their often desperate, ill‑informed, mentally disturbed, or legally abusive customers. This is crucial to understand the non-substance of any OPCA concept or strategy. The story and process of a OPCA scheme is not intended to impress or convince the Courts, ''but rather to impress the guru's customer''.&lt;ref name="meads-canlii"&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571]''(CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 18 September 2012, para. 77&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;[emphasis in original]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:In a subsequent ruling on another OPCA case, ''Gauthier v. Starr 2016 ABQB 213'', Justice Rooke noted that, following the ruling, Meads had abandoned OPCA strategies and concluded the litigation in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20160419203650/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2016/2016abqb213/2016abqb213.html Gauthier v Starr, 2016 ABQB 213]''  (CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 14 April 2016, para. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elizabeth Watson came to public attention in 2011 as a self-styled legal adviser for Victoria Haigh in a (child) custody case; she was given a nine-month [[prison sentence]] for [[contempt of court]] (later suspended). She had defaced court documents by writing the words "no contract" and otherwise refused to accept or acknowledge the authority of a court of law, by amongst other things refusing to respond to the written legal notices or other correspondences from the court, and styled and addressed herself and Haigh in the irregular fashion as "Elizabeth of the Watson family" and "Victoria of the Haigh family" respectively, instead of their names in the normal and usual mode of rendering.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2011/B15.html# Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council and Elizabeth Watson and Victoria Haigh]'', Royal Courts of Justice, 22 August 2011, [2011] 3 FCR 422, [2011] Fam Law 1194, [2011] EWHC B15 (Fam)&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/investigator_jailed_for_report_as_court_contempt_compromised_well_being_of_child_1_3706219# "‘Investigator’ jailed for report as court contempt compromised well-being of child"], ''The Star'' (Sheffield), 24 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mark Bond of [[Norfolk]], England, was arrested in 2010 for non-payment of tax, despite handing police a "notice of intent" stating that he was no longer a UK citizen. He told police that the notice had already been delivered to the Queen and the prime minister. He told the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', "Today I asked the judge to walk into the court under common law and not commercial law. If I had entered under commercial law it would prove that I accepted its law. I was denied my rights to go in there." He was sentenced to three months custody, suspended on condition that he pay off the debt at £20 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Bale, [http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/norfolk_tax_dodger_arrested_after_writing_to_queen_1_745681 "Norfolk tax dodger arrested... after writing to Queen"], ''Norwich Evening News'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bobby Sludds appeared in court in [[County Wexford]] in Ireland, charged with various motoring offences including two counts of no insurance. Before the police began to give evidence, the accused handed in a letter stating he was not Mr. Sludds but Bobby of the family Sludds and questioning the use of the word 'person' in the charge. He was given two suspended sentences and a fine of €670. (He had 24 previous convictions for motoring offences.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexfordpeople.ie/news/bobby-of-the-family-sludds-may-be-jailed-2878029.html "'Bobby of the family Sludds' may be jailed"], ''Wexford People'', 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wilfred Keith Thompson and two others were arrested by police in [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, charged with breaking, entering and theft as well as firearms offences. Thompson had previously made headlines for informing City Hall, local police, Guelph MP [[Frank Valeriote]], Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and other officials he is "an autonomous being not controlled by others". One of his co-defendants, Trevor "Red" De Block, refused to identify himself to the court, though it was said that his criminal mug shot, computer records, tattoos and other information confirmed his identity. "I object," De Block said, adding that he was not the "rightful owner" of his name, but refusing to clarify or participate in legal proceedings. "I don't bow down to bail .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to false gods," he said, and rejected assistance from the appointed lawyer. Thompson and De Block were denied bail.&lt;ref&gt;Vik Kirsch, [https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/2778969-security-tight-as-suspects-in-guelph-break-in-case-appear-in-bail-court/ "Security tight as suspects in Guelph break-in case appear in bail court"], ''Guelph Mercury'', 5 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dean Marshall of [[Preston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Preston]], [[Holderness]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Yorkshire]], England, was taken to court after he was found to be growing 26 [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] plants in his garden shed. Claiming he was a freeman on the land and therefore not guilty, he then attempted to call up [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and (the prime minister) [[David Cameron]] as his witnesses, although he was told that neither was available to attend. A jury at Hull [[Crown Court]] dismissed his claims and convicted him of conspiracy to produce cannabis for which he was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended upon entering into a good behaviour bond for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html "Cannabis-grower tried to call Queen and Prime Minister as witnesses in 'bizarre' trial"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817235748/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html |date=17 August 2012 }}, ''Hull Daily Mail'', 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doug Jones of [[Pembroke Dock]], Pembrokeshire, Wales, spent 22 days in prison after refusing to take a breath test. Jones questioned the authority and jurisdiction of the court, asking to see the judge's 'Oath of Office' which resulted in a sentence of fourteen days for [[contempt of court]]. He was sentenced to a further seven days after failing to attend a second hearing, but pleaded guilty to the original charges, receiving [[List of UK driving licence endorsements|an endorsement on his driving licence]]. His interest in the freemen on the land movement started after watching documentaries on conspiracy theories surrounding the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]].  His solicitor, Phillipa Ashworth, stated "On this occasion, in hindsight he appreciates it was not the time to test out philosophical theories behind this approach to life, and in hindsight it isn't something he would do again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/9918044.Jail_for_man_who_refused__to_be_governed_/?ref=rss "Magna Carta beliefs lead to 22 days jail for Pembrokeshire businessman who refused 'to be governed'"], ''Western Telegraph'', 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gavin Kaylhem of [[Grimsby]], [[North East Lincolnshire]], England, wilfully refused to pay his [[council tax]] debts of £1,268.54 accrued between 2001 and 2008 and was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. He had claimed that he was a "freeman" and thus had no contractual duty under common law to pay. He refused to co-operate with [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]' questions.&lt;ref&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council, [http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ "Council tax evader jailed for 30 days"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211022928/http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ |date=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mandeep Sandhu of [[Tividale]], [[Sandwell]], West Midlands, was stopped by police while driving a car that was insured to a woman. He refused to give his details to the officers, saying that to do so would mean "entering into a contract he could not afford to fulfil". He refused to co-operate at the police station and when brought before Sandwell Magistrates' Court, in October 2015, Sandhu was convicted of driving without insurance and obstructing police and was also found in contempt of court. He was sentenced to 14 days in prison for the contempt, and ordered to pay £330 in fines for the insurance charge with court costs and had 6 points added to his licence. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/freeman-land-driver-jailed-contempt-10253089|title='Freeman-of-the-Land' driver jailed for contempt of court|work=The Birmingham Mail|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;- {{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2015/10/13/freeman-driver-who-refused-to-talk-to-police-jailed/|title='Freeman' driver who refused to talk to police jailed|work=Express &amp; Star|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole process meant that a simple matter of driving without insurance took up hours of police time – and ultimately a stint behind bars after being convicted of contempt of court while defending himself. We hope this case acts as a warning that to obstruct the police and the courts is not a wise move.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Advice to professionals ==
Lawyers and notaries in [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], Canada, have been warned by their professional bodies about dealing with freemen as clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/09/28/law-society-of-alberta-issues-warning-to-lawyers-after-bizarre-calgary-freeman-on-the-land-case-resolved/ "Law Society of Alberta issues warning to lawyers after bizarre Calgary 'Freeman on the Land" case resolved"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417062013/http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/09/28/law-society-of-alberta-issues-warning-to-lawyers-after-bizarre-calgary-freeman-on-the-land-case-resolved/ |date=17 April 2015 }}, ''Calgary Sun'', 28 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, lawyers have been advised to be careful not to stamp or notarise the pseudo-legal documents that freemen typically use, so as not to create a perception of authority for such documents.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Society of British Columbia: [http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=2627 ''Practice Tips: The Freeman-on-the-Land movement''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417061546/http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=2627 |date=17 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. police, both speaking personally and as official guidance, have provided advice to law enforcement on dealing with the similar [[sovereign citizen movement]].

[[File:4778 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 12 - Iniusticia seva sum - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 31-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|'''Injustice''', one in a series of [[allegory|allegorical]] [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] depicting vices and virtues at the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Ducal Palace in Venice]]]]

'''Injustice''' is a quality relating to unfairness or undeserved outcomes. The term may be applied in reference to a particular event or situation, or to a larger [[status quo]]. In [[Western philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]], injustice is very commonly—but not always—defined as  either the absence or the opposite of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. Textbook on Jurisprudence. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Simon" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze" /&gt;

The sense of injustice is a universal human feature, though the exact circumstances considered unjust can vary from culture to culture. While even acts of nature can sometimes arouse the sense of injustice, the sense is usually felt in relation to human action such as misuse, [[abuse]], neglect, or malfeasance that is uncorrected or else sanctioned by a [[legal system]] or fellow human beings.

The sense of injustice can be a powerful motivational condition, causing people to take action not just to defend themselves but also others who they perceive to be unfairly treated.

==Relationship with justice==
Professor [[Judith N. Shklar|Judith Shklar]] has written that Western philosophers tend to spend much more time discussing the concept of 'justice' rather than 'injustice'. On the other hand, she states both historical writing and fiction use instances of injustice as subject matter far more often than justice.&lt;ref name = "Judith" /&gt;

In philosophy and jurisprudence, the dominant view has been that injustice and justice are two sides of the same coin—that injustice is simply a lack of justice.  This view has been challenged by professors including Judith Shklar, Thomas W Simon and [[Eric Heinze]], who consider that justice and injustice are independent qualities. So, in this minority view, you can increase the justice of a situation without reducing the injustice. Heinze has even gone as far as to argue that an increase in justice can actually cause an increase in injustice.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;

A relatively common view among philosophers and other writers is that while justice and injustice may be interdependent, it is injustice that is the primary quality. Many writers have written that, while it is hard to directly define or even perceive justice, it is easy to demonstrate that injustice can be perceived by all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| volume = 55| issue = 2
| pages = 336–364| year = 1946| jstor = 792700
| doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]], the earliest known thinker to state that injustice is the primary quality was [[Heraclitus]],  whose view was echoed by [[Aristotle]] and dozens of others down the centuries. Hayek said that writers often express the idea that injustice is the primary concept "as though it were a new discovery", suggesting the view is rarely directly expressed in theories on Justice. But Hayek went on to say that [[legal positivism]] has proved that injustice, not justice, is the primary quality.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 8 "THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE"  in Vol 2 of  von Hayeks's ''The mirage of social justice'' (University of Chicago Press,  1978). For a list discussing dozens of writers who have stated down the centuries that  injustice, not justice, is the primary concept, look out for the long footnote under the sub heading  "Rules of just conduct are generally prohibitions of unjust conduct"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sense of injustice==
[[File:Flickr - Yale Law Library - Beast of Injustice.jpg|thumb|right|A metaphorical injustice eating the innocent in [[Guillaume Rouillé]]'s ''Justicie atque Iniusticie''.  The legs of the beast include ''adolescés sine obediétia'' (disobedient youth) and ''plebs sine disciplina''(undisciplined commoners).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://library.law.yale.edu/blogs/rare-books/2010-07 |author=Mike Widener |title=More images in our Flickr galleries|publisher=Yale Law Library |date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Scholars including Judith Shklar, Edmond Cahn  and [[Barrington Moore, Jr.]] have surveyed anthropological and historical work on injustice, concluding that the sense of injustice is found everywhere there are men and women; it is a [[human universal]].&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore" /&gt;    
These writers, and others like [[Simone Weil]], Elizabeth Wolgast and Thomas W Simon, hold that the sense of injustice is a powerful motivational condition — unlike the sense of justice which tends to be conceived in more abstract ways, and tends to inspire contemplation rather than action.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Clive. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Priority_of_Injustice.html?id=_2jmAQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory'']. (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2017). {{ISBN| 978-0820351520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cahn held that, for [[evolution|evolutionary reasons]], humans who witness others being subjected to injustice can respond as though it was an act of aggression towards themselves. There can be an immediate, visceral activation of the [[fight-or-flight response|flight or fight]] system. As [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] puts it "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr., [[Letter from a Birmingham Jail]] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study published in [[Psychological Science]] found that even babies have a sense of injustice and dislike having it violated, even when they witness events that do not directly effect them.&lt;ref&gt;

In the field of jurisprudence, Cahn has argued that it is an important skill for lawyers to know how to rouse a jury's sense of injustice — something best done by appeals to the particular, not by abstractions or [[Boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] type statements.  Barrington Moore asserts that reasons why populations often submit to [[oppression]] for long periods of time is that they consider it inevitable and so their sense of injustice is not aroused. He says that a widely shared sense of injustice is an essential, though not sufficient, cause of rebellion.  Writers including Simone Weil, Elizabeth Wolgast and Judith Shklar have said that an aroused sense of injustice can be an essential prerequisite to action needed for protecting the weak and afflicted.&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast"/&gt;

==Causes==
A common cause of injustice is human selfishness. As [[Plato]] described at length in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', people will often commit acts of injustice when they calculate it is in their interests to do so.&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;  Plato also adds that "The highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not".   Human injustice is not always caused by attempt to gain unfair advantage or malice; it may be simply the result of the flawed human [[decision making]]. For example, studies have found that judges sitting on review boards are less likely to reach decisions favorable to applicants depending on how long it is since the judges had their last food break.&lt;ref&gt;"We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break." {{cite journal |author1=Shai Danzigera |author2=Jonathan Levav |author3=Liora Avnaim-Pessoa| title=Extraneous factors in judicial decisions |date=11 April 2011 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=108 |issue=17 |pages=6889–92 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1018033108 |pmid=21482790 | accessdate=15 November 2011|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.6889D |pmc=3084045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on the substantial difference in judges' decisions depending on time since last food break, see chpt 3 of [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Misuse and abuse with regard to a particular case or context may represent a systemic failure to serve the cause of justice (cf. [[Non liquet|legal vacuum]]).&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;

'''Jean Carbonnier''' (1908–2003) was one of the most important French jurists of the 20th century. He was a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] specialist and a [[private law]] professor.

==Life and career==
Jean Carbonnier was the son of Fernand Carbonnier and Dany Daniel. He married Madeleine Hugues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Encrevé|first=André|title=Les Protestants|year=1993|publisher=Beauchesne|location=Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W14H-ZKO9lAC&amp;pg=PA115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Protestant beliefs influenced his way of thinking and his work. Although Jean Carbonnier published theological and historical articles about [[Protestantism]], he still supported secularity.

Jean Cabonnier studied at the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Bordeaux]] where he obtained his [[doctorate]] in 1932 and private law ''[[agrégation]]'' in 1937.

He was a professor at the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Poitiers]] from 1937 to 1955, teaching French civil law. He became dean in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|url=http://expocujas.univ-paris1.fr/Carbonnier/|publisher=Bibliothèque Interuniversitaire Cujas|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, he published his ''Treatise on Civil Law'' (''Droit civil'') in 1955, which has been republished several times since then. Afterwards, Jean Carbonnier taught at the [[Paris Law Faculty]] (replaced with [[Panthéon-Assas University]] in 1970) until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|url=http://expocujas.univ-paris1.fr/Carbonnier/|publisher=Bibliothèque Interuniversitaire Cujas|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Carbonnier became President of ''[[L'Année Sociologique]]'' in 1964, and worked for the sociology journal during fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guibentif |first=Pierre |title=Hommage à Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003) |url=http://w3.aislf.univ-tlse2.fr/cr3/cr3__n_JC.htm |date=January 2004 |publisher=AISLF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107051919/http://w3.aislf.univ-tlse2.fr/cr3/cr3__n_JC.htm |archivedate=2013-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created and started heading the Laboratory for Legal Sociology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research Committee on Sociology of Law|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro_Tribute_Carb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratoire de sociologie juridique|url=http://www.u-paris2.fr/52075380/0/fiche___laboratoire/&amp;RH=LABO|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923213253/http://www.u-paris2.fr/52075380/0/fiche___laboratoire/%26RH%3DLABO|archivedate=2009-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (''Laboratoire de sociologie juridique'') at [[Panthéon-Assas University]] in 1968 - in order to produce data that would help law making.

On the international level, Jean Carbonnier supported the creation of the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research Committee on Sociology of Law|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro_Tribute_Carb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in the inauguration of the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]] in Oñati, with Renato Treves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnaud|first=André-Jean|title=Jean Carbonnier, Renato Treves et la sociologie du droit|year=1995|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|author2=Andrini, Simona}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Carbonnier was particularly well known in Canada and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niort|first=Jean-François|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://www.puf.com/Auteur:Jean_Carbonnier|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|location=Paris|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a professor, he also often referenced to foreign legal systems, such as Germany or Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|url=http://expocujas.univ-paris1.fr/Carbonnier/|publisher=Bibliothèque Interuniversitaire Cujas|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his academic career, Jean Carbonnier was also a writer: his book ''Les incertitudes du jeune Saxon. Une autofiction de Jean Carbonnier''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Les incertitudes du jeune Saxon. Une autofiction de Jean Carbonnier|year=2011|publisher=Lexis Nexis|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was published posthumously, in 2011. This fiction shows that Jean Carbonnier was not only a theorist, but also an author of literature. This element can be perceived while reading his theoretical works about law, since he always explained his thoughts with an elegant and precise way of writing. ''Les incertitudes du jeune Saxon'' represents at the same time a fiction (sort of ''[[Bildungsroman]]'') and a reflection about law and history. This work is also linked with the story of his own family and tastes.

==Carbonnier's thought==
Jean Carbonnier's vision of law was based on his own philosophy, which includes [[Protestantism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[skepticism]], and [[empiricism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niort|first=Jean-François|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://www.puf.com/Auteur:Jean_Carbonnier|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|location=Paris|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; – always with open-mindedness. He was at the same time a theorist, an author, and a lawmaker. That is why he was – and still is – often called "''jurislateur''," which can be translated as "''jurislator''" in English.

His works are open to the [[sociology of law]] and the [[philosophy of law]], cleverly linking legal, political, and social sciences. The author observed society in order to understand it. He also considered legal phenomena as social facts. At the same time a jurist and a sociologist, Jean Carbonnier played an important role in adapting law to society's traditions and customs. He considered law as an ''artifact'', and was interested in every system of norms. In ''Flexible droit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Flexible droit - Pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur|year=2011|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; he explains how law is changeable, uncertain – and "flexible."

=== Law and Sociology===
Jean Carbonnier inspired, constituted, and conceptualized the combination of the study of law with that of sociology ([[legal sociology]]) – at a time when it was not popular among French jurists. He practiced "''sociology without rigor''," as the subtitle of his work ''Flexible droit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Flexible droit - Pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur|year=2011|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows. Indeed, Jean Carbonnier did not like "rigid" law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frison-Roche|first=Marie-Anne|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|journal=L'Année sociologique|year=2003|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-l-annee-sociologique-2003-1-page-289.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since our society is multicultural, law must adapt to its transformations – for instance, concerning family. In ''Sociologie juridique''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Sociologie juridique|year=1978|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France, Collection Quadrige|location=Paris|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (1968), Jean Carbonnier explained his theories about the links between law and society. This work represents his most famous one on the international level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research Committee on Sociology of Law|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro_Tribute_Carb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially thanks to the concepts he developed, as well as his account of the relationship between jurisprudence and social sciences. 
In ''Flexible droit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Flexible droit - Pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur|year=2011|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1969), the core study was "''non-law''" ("''non-droit''"), considered as the essence of social life. For Jean Carbonnier, when there is no law, other systems of social regulations will work instead – for instance, religion, morality, customs, friendships, or habits. This part of the book also made Jean Carbonnier an internationally recognized jurist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnaud|first=André-Jean|title=Jean Carbonnier, Renato Treves et la sociologie du droit|year=1995|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|author2=Andrini, Simona}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His last work, ''Droit et passion du droit sous la Vème République'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Droit et passion du droit sous la Vème République|year=2006|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  also is a legal and sociological work. His study of labor law and contract law represents a good example of legal sociology.

In sum, Jean Carbonnier established at the same time a clear and understandable sociological theory for jurists, as well as a legal theory within the reach of sociologists. This synthesis between law and sociology allowed the usage of sociological methods of investigation, thereby breaking with the "rational" tradition in French legislation. These methods include the [[opinion poll]] ([[IFOP]], then [[INED]]) and [[field research]] in order to measure the "demand for law" expressed by citizens. This allowed notably the establishment of divorce by mutual consent (1975), at a time when divorce by fault was the only form offered to divorcing couples.

===Civil Code and Family law===
Jean Carbonnier renewed the [[French Civil Code]], especially in the domain of [[Family Law]]. He wrote a major ''Treatise on Civil Law'' (''Droit civil''), which is not only a theoretical work, but also shows links with history, sociology, anthropology, and philosophy. The author defined the French Civil Code as the "Civil Constitution of French people," i.e. as part of the national, legal, and political culture in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verdier|first=Raymond|title=Jean Carbonnier : L'homme et l'œuvre|year=2012|publisher=Presses Universitaires de Paris Ouest|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Carbonnier was regarded as an authority on family law and considered family as a legal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Research Committee on Sociology of Law|title=Jean Carbonnier|url=http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro_Tribute_Carb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the inspiration and wrote the pre-projects (''avant-projets'') for ambitious reforms, from 1964 to 1977. These reforms include fields such as incapacity law (1964 and 1968), parental authority (1970), [[filiation]] (1972), and [[divorce]] (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frison-Roche|first=Marie-Anne|title=Jean Carbonnier (1908-2003)|journal=L'Année sociologique|year=2003|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-l-annee-sociologique-2003-1-page-289.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were exposed and explained in ''Essais sur les lois''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Essais sur les lois|year=1995|publisher=Defrenois Ouvrages|location=Paris|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1979).

With Pierre Catala, a French law professor, Jean Carbonnier authored a proposition for the reform of [[inheritance law]]. It was taken up by the legislature in its law of 3 December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loi no 2001-1135 du 3 décembre 2001 relative aux droits du conjoint survivant et des enfants adultérins et modernisant diverses dispositions de droit successoral|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000582185&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;  French inheritance law was thereby adapted to the aspirations of the modern family.

===Passion and Inflation of the Law===
Through his critical mind and his convincing rhetoric, Jean Carbonnier used the term "passion" in the title of his book ''Droit et passion du droit sous la Vème République'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Droit et passion du droit sous la Vème République|year=2006|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind it would be that producing too many laws tend to be harmful and dangerous. This refers to the tendency, in France, to legislate too much, leading to an "inflation" of the law. This excess is meant to limit arbitrary powers. Moreover, it is a consequence of decentralization and the importance of community law. Sociologically, with the growing power of the media, lawmakers must react constantly, which result in an increasing production of laws. For instance, some are used as tools for political and electoral communication. Law therefore becomes "educational" (''pédagogique'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbonnier|first=Jean|title=Flexible droit - Pour une sociologie du droit sans rigueur|year=2011|publisher=L.G.D.J|location=Paris|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This passion is dangerous, or even destructive. Indeed, the more laws there are, the less likely it is possible to apply them effectively. In particular, inflation leads to misunderstanding or ignorance from citizens – and sometimes even from judges. This results in a lack of substance and credibility. The inflation therefore implies uncertainty (or insecurity). Jean Carbonnier's theories are still topical: for instance, in 2006, the [[French Council of State]] (''Conseil d'Etat'') criticized the excesses that could threaten social cohesion in its annual report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conseil d'Etat |title=Sécurité juridique et complexité du droit - Rapport public 2006 |url=http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/rapports-et-etudes/rapport-public-2006.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522173532/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/rapports-et-etudes/rapport-public-2006.html |archivedate=2013-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  about [[legal certainty]] (''Sécurité juridique et complexité du droit'').

===Subjectivisation of the Law===
Another evolution described by Jean Carbonnier is the subjectivisation of the law. This refers to the fact that the "rights to..." (''droits à...'') become more and more important. The author speaks in terms of a "pulverisation in subjective rights" (''pulvérisation en droits subjectifs''). Subjective rights (or [[entitlements]]) are replacing legal principles. This subjectivisation of the legal system reconstructs it, focusing on [[fundamental rights]] (substantial notion), instead of the law itself (institutional notion).

Therefore, law considers each individual (fundamental rights), rather than society as a whole. The legislation becomes more particular and precise. As a consequence, there is an inversion of the role and status of lawmakers in France: they are more and more concrete, whereas judges become more abstract. This results in individualization, which is a source of the inflation.

{{Main|Committee}}
A '''joint committee''' is a committee made up of members of both chambers of a [[bicameral]] legislature. In other contexts, it refers to a committee with members from more than one organization.

==Germany==
A joint committee (''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss]]'') comprises members of both [[Bundestag]] (two thirds) and [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (one third). It exists to ensure a working legislature during a [[State of Defence (Germany)|state of defense]].

==Republic of Ireland==
A Joint Committee of the Irish Oireachtas (parliament) comprises members of both Dáil Éireann (the lower house) and Seanad Éireann (the upper house).

==Philippines==
A bicameral conference committee is formed for each bill where the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] have conflicting versions. The committee has the same number of members from each chamber. Once passed, the chambers then have to approve the version passed by the bicameral conference committee in order for it to be sent for the president's signature.

If [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] is short on time, a chamber may approve the other chamber's version instead.

==United Kingdom==
A joint committee of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] is a [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|select committee]] consisting of members of both the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]].

In the UK the term "joint committee" can also refer to a committee of local authorities established under the provisions of  [[Local Government Act 1972]].

==United States==
A joint committee of the [[United States Congress]] is a [[United States congressional committee|congressional committee]] consisting of both [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House]] members and having jurisdiction over matters of joint interest. An example of a joint committee is the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Library|Joint Committee on the Library]]. Most joint committees are permanent (as with the Library Committee) but temporary joint committees have been created to address specific issues (such as the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]] during the [[American Civil War]]).

===Current joint committees===
{{main|List of current United States congressional joint committees}}
{{As of|2017|06|17|alt=As of June 17, 2017, there were}} four joint committees: the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Economic]], [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Library|Library]], [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Printing|Printing]], and [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Taxation]] committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Committees of the U.S. Congress |url=https://www.congress.gov/committees |accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-joint committees===
In addition to the joint committees, Congress also has [[Standing committee (United States Congress)|standing]] and [[Select or special committee|select/special]] committees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28451">'''Jury sentencing''' is the practice, in some U.S. states, of having [[jury|juries]] decide what penalties to give those who have been convicted of criminal offenses. The practice of jury sentencing began in [[Virginia]] in the 18th century and spread westward to other states that were influenced by Virginia-trained lawyers.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; As of 2018, [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.173.1272&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=59 ARK.CODE ANN. § 5-4-103|date=2010|quote=If a defendant is charged with a felony and is found guilty of an offense by a jury, the jury shall fix punishment . . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2010|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=39605|title=60 KY.REV.STAT.ANN. § 532.055|quote=Upon return of a verdict of guilty . . . the court shall conduct a sentencing hearing before the jury, if such case was tried before a jury.

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.&lt;ref name=statutory/&gt;

==History==
===Rise of jury sentencing===
The impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Virginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution_of_Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas_Jefferson#Minister_to_France|Jefferson was in France]].&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Sentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should "suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776-1845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

The adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

During the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The 
change to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.&lt;ref name=grab/&gt;

Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

===Decline of jury sentencing===
The 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

These systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults. In the prison system, [[parole commission]]ers, trained in penology and insulated from political pressures, determined when prisoners had been rehabilitated and could be reintegrated into society.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

The process of preparing a presentence report, which takes weeks, only begins after the defendant is convicted, since if he/she were to be acquitted, the effort that went into preparing the report would be wasted. It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

Furthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.&lt;ref name=statutory&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134-1172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of a intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.

Georgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937-1939, and from 1913-1923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]]. By 1919, fourteen states gave juries sentencing powers in non-capital cases, although by 1960, that number had dropped to thirteen.&lt;ref name=democratic&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice|author=Iontcheva, Jenia|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=89|number=2|date=April 2003|pages=311-383|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3202435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, [[determinate sentencing]], a new intellectual current that repudiated the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]] model with its focus on using mathematical models and grids to determine sentences, had made inroads, making jury sentencing seem like more of an anachronism.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Georgia permanently abandoned jury sentencing in 1974 and Tennessee did the same in 1982.&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Nancy J.|title=The Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing in the United States|volume=78|journal=Chi.-Kent L. Rev.|number=937|date=2003|url=https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cklawreview/vol78/iss3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota had also abandoned jury sentencing, and Mississippi was using jury sentencing only in rape and statutory rape cases. Oklahoma abolished jury sentencing but reinstated it in 1999.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

===Possible revival of jury sentencing===
According to some commentators, the time is ripe for a revival of jury sentencing, because flaws in the determinate sentencing systems are becoming increasingly apparent. Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce racial disparity in sentencing.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775-1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]]. There have been movements to abolish sentencing commissions and guideline systems and inform jurors of their right to nullify. Decisions like ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find any facts that would increase a defendant's maximum sentence) and ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find whether there are aggravating factors justifying capital punishment) have also signaled a willingness by the judiciary to expand the role of the jury in the legal process.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Jury sentencing has been seen as a way to in many cases render moot the questions raised by ''Apprendi'' and related cases such as ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'' and ''[[United States v. Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibas, Stephanos and Klein, Susan R.|title=The Sixth Amendment and Criminal Sentencing|date=2008|journal=Faculty Scholarship|number=921|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/921}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the differences between [[Element (criminal law)|elements of an offense]] and sentencing factors by letting the jury decide all the facts.&lt;ref name=applying&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying Apprendi to jury sentencing: why state felony jury sentencing threatens the right to a jury trial|author=Carrington, Melissa|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=2011|number=4|pages=1359-1385|url=http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Carrington.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases such as ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' and ''[[Graham v. Florida]]'' (banning mandatory life imprisonment without parole, and life imprisonment without parole in non-homicide cases, respectively, for juveniles, as contrary to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]]) also raise a question of whether the Supreme Court logically should allow only a jury, rather than a judge, to determine a juvenile should receive such a sentence, given the parallels between adult capital punishment case law and juvenile life imprisonment with parole case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Russell, Sarah F.|title=Jury Sentencing and Juveniles: Eighth Amendment Limits and Sixth Amendment Rights|volume=56|journal=B.C.L. Rev.|number=553|date=2015|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol56/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plea bargains, judicial override, and juror access to information==
In Virginia, under the 1796 act, capital punishment remained mandatory for [[first-degree murder]], but the penalty for [[second-degree murder]] was any term between five and eighteen years in the penitentiary. The 1796 act gave the court in murder cases the authority to "determine the degree of the crime, and to give sentence accordingly" when a defendant was "convicted by confession." The judge's discretion to set sentences in cases of confession did not exist in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In Missouri, informing juries of sentences of defendants in similar cases or the sentences of co-participants in the crime on trial is strictly prohibited under the rules of evidence." Similarly, the Kentucky [[truth in sentencing]] statute, which generally increases the information available to sentencing juries, does not provide for sentencing guidelines and statistics. Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible. The military at one time provided [[United States military jury|jurors]] with sentencing statistics and guidelines was the military, but this practice ended in the late 1950s as the military's judicial philosophy shifted its emphasis away from sentencing uniformity and towards individualized judgments. The [[United States Court of Military Appeals]] held that jurors were not to consider sentences in similar cases or to consult the sentencing manual.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Under Virginia's current system, jurors are controversially not allowed access to the Commonwealth's [[sentencing guidelines]] or to information about whether sentences will run consecutively or concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20120401-2012-04-01-dp-nws-crime-notebook-0401-20120331-story.html|date=1 April 2012|title=Virginia judges rarely question juries' sentencing recommendations|publisher=Daily Press|author=Kelly, Ashley and Dujardin, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2000 were also not informed that parole had been abolished in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/va_md_dc/virginia-eyes-new-sentences-after-juries-didn-t-get-key/article_1008cc74-de6f-5b77-bdd0-61c099dd9400.html|title=Virginia eyes new sentences after juries didn't get key fact|author=Durkin, Alana|publisher=Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must justify any departure from the jury's recommendation in writing to the [[Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission]]. Less than one-quarter of jury-recommended sentences are modified by judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Caleb R.|title=Sentencing Roulette: How Virginia’s Criminal Sentencing System is Imposing an Unconstitutional Trial Penalty That Suppresses the Rights of Criminal Defendants to a Jury Trial|volume=23|journal=Wm.&amp; Mary Bill Rts. J.|number=559|date=2014|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmborj/vol23/iss2/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about juries' imposing higher sentences than what the sentencing guidelines would suggest, many defendants opt either for [[bench trial]]s or [[plea bargain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of juried trials slumps both in Va., nationwide |url=https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/number-of-juried-trials-slumps-both-in-va-nationwide/article_d2dbfd5c-34cc-5d9c-b999-a9c6641783f9.html|author=Green, Frank|publisher=Daily Progress|date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States with jury sentencing have often allowed judges to intervene in the sentencing process, e.g. by reducing the sentence imposed by the jury, imposing hard labor or solitary confinement in addition to the jury's assessment of fines, or determining the place of confinement imposed by the jury.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In Alabama, judges were allowed to override juries' recommendations of life imprisonment and impose capital punishment instead, until a 2017 law took that power away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/07/death_penalty_judicial_overrid.html|title=Did judicial override end in Alabama? Some say judges can still overrule jury over death penalty|date=21 July 2017|publisher=AL.com|author=Remkus, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jury sentencing states except Texas allow the judge to fix the punishment in case the jury fails to agree on a sentence,&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; making it impossible for there to be a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]] at sentencing.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

==Arguments for and against jury sentencing==
Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;

An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.&lt;ref name=booker&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga. L. Rev.|number=897|date=2005|url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/faculty_lawreviews/131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments that have been raised against sentencing by jury are that juries are not as accountable as judges; that putting them in charge of determining both guilt and the sentence concentrates too much power in one body; and that different juries may differ widely in the sentences they impose. Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

It is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since "one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&amp;context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

An advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service. Racial and other minorities may also benefit from having greater representation among jurors than among judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

In jurisdictions that do not have any statutory provisions formally allowing jury sentencing, judges have sometimes consulted with the jury on sentencing anyway. At the federal level, the practice of polling the jury and using their input in sentencing was upheld on appeal by the [[6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/06/federal_appeals_court_upholds.html|title=Federal appeals court upholds judge's lowest possible sentence in child-porn case|author=Heisig, Eric|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence,&lt;ref name=grab&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webster, Charles W.|title=Jury Sentencing - Grab-Bag Justice|volume=14|journal=Sw L.J.|number=221|date=1960|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol14/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In [[New South Wales]], a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice [[Jim Spigelman]] to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge [[Reg Blanch]] cited "an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence". Concerns about [[jury tampering]] through intimidation by defendants were also raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/keep-juries-away-from-sentencing-say-judges-20070427-gdq067.html|title=Keep juries away from sentencing, say judges|author=Pearlman, Jonathan|date=27 April 2007|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and many other [[continental Europe]]an countries have a system in which professional judges and [[Judiciary_of_Germany#Lay_judges|lay judges]] deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time‐consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo‐American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mixed Court and Jury Court: Could the Continental Alternative Fill the American Need?|author=Langbein, John H.|date=January 1981|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1981.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable jury sentences==
Civil rights leader [[James Bevel]] was sentenced to 15 years in prison pursuant to the recommendation of a Virginia jury that found him guilty of having sex with his teenage daughter in the 1990s when they lived in Leesburg. The sentencing range had been 5 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=43768|title=Civil Rights Leader Convicted of Incest|author=Barakat, Matthew|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''legal clinic''' (also '''law clinic''' or '''law school clinic''') is a [[law school]] program providing hands-on-legal experience to law school students and [[Legal aid|services]] to various clients.  Clinics are usually directed by clinical professors.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition,'' "clinical legal studies," (St. Paul, Minn: West Publishing Co., 1990), 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal clinics typically do ''[[pro bono]]'' work in a particular area, providing free legal services to clients.

A legal clinic or law clinic is a nonprofit law practice serving the public interest. Legal clinics originated as a method of practical teaching of law school students, but today they encompass also free [[legal aid]] with no academic links.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yakasai, "Meaning of a Legal Clinic',2016&lt;/ref&gt; There are practice-based law clinics with no academic link which provide hands-on skills to lawyers, judges and non-lawyers on practical ethical dimensions of the law at the same time offer free public defence legal services.&lt;ref&gt;International organizations,lextern web,2017(https://www.lexternweb.org/international-organizations)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Avani Bansal, In cases where parties cannot afford a [[lawyer]] and are provided legal services by the state, the quality of that legal representation is often questionable. Therefore the need for clinical legal education, or establishing [[legal aid]] clinics at law schools, where law students can provide [[legal advice]] to indigent people.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bansal|first1=Avani|title=Clinical legal education as a means to means to advance to advance access to justice in India|url=http://www.livelaw.in/clinical-legal-education-means-advance-access-justice-india/ Part 1 &amp; Part 2|website=livelaw.in|publisher=livelaw.in|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals, objectives &amp; Methods ==
Students typically provide assistance with research, drafting legal arguments, and meeting with clients. In many cases, one of the clinic's professors will show up for [[oral argument]] before the Court. However, many jurisdictions have "student practice" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XX,http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXX.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uniform Local Rules Of The United States District Courts For The Eastern, Middle, And Western Districts Of Louisiana, LR83.2.13, {{cite web |url=http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/LocalRules/Civil_83.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703173017/http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/LocalRules/Civil_83.htm |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Areas of service==
[[File:Legal clinic - case files.JPG|thumb|Legal clinic - case files at [[Palacký University]] Faculty of Law Legal Clinic]]
Clinical legal studies exist in diverse areas such as immigration law, [[environmental law]], intellectual property, housing, criminal defense, criminal prosecution, American Indian law, human rights and international criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uu.nl/legalclinic "404 - Universiteit Utrecht", University Utrecht School of Law Clinical Programme on Conflict, Human Rights and International Justice], retrieved March 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinics sometimes sue big companies and government entities, which has led to pushback in courts and legislatures, including attempts to put limits on whom clinics can sue without losing state subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/us/04lawschool.html?hp|title=School Law Clinics Face a Backlash|last=Urbina|first=Ian|date=April 3, 2010|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|access-date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Pro Bono Net===
[[Pro Bono Net]] are online [[Legal aid]] services, in some cases supported by legal clinics.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt;

==Obstacles==
While in many jurisdictions have "student practice" rules that allow law-clinic students to appear and argue in court.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XX,http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXX.asp&lt;/ref&gt;, in some countries like India law students are still studying at law schools, they cannot represent the clients in courts by themselves.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt; 

According to Avani Bansal in many law schools, clinical legal education is imparted without the support of practical component and lacks policy. Participation in many of these legal clinics lacks academic credits. Lack of resources, lack of trained faculty for the purpose, lack of involvement of [[Bar council|Bar Council]] Members leads to ineffective and weak clinical legal education in countries like India. Communities around are not informed so are not involved. All these aspects frustrate the effective purpose of the Legal clinic in the sense that it neither trains students in practice nor it reaches to the public.&lt;ref name="Avani Bansal" /&gt;

Some of these are more obviously structural than others - hence the term legal opportunity is sometimes preferred over legal opportunity structure.

Legal opportunity has been used as an [[independent variable]] to help to explain strategy choice by social movement organisations (SMOs) - e.g. why SMOS adopt litigation rather than protest or political lobbying as a strategy.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}

The '''letter of the law''' versus the '''spirit of the law''' is an [[idiomatic]] [[antithesis]]. When one obeys the letter of the law but not the spirit, one is obeying the literal interpretation of the words (the "letter") of the [[law]], but not necessarily the ''intent'' of those who wrote the law.  Conversely, when one obeys the spirit of the law but not the letter, one is doing what the authors of the law intended, though not necessarily adhering to the literal wording.

"Law" originally referred to [[Statutory law|legislative statute]], but in the idiom may refer to any kind of rule. Intentionally following the letter of the law but not the spirit may be accomplished through exploiting [[Technicality|technicalities]], [[loopholes]], and ambiguous language.

== Shakespeare ==
[[Image:Portia and Shylock.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Shylock]] and [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]]'' (1835) by [[Thomas Sully]]]]
[[William Shakespeare]] wrote numerous plays dealing with the letter versus spirit antithesis, almost always coming down on the side of "spirit", often forcing villains (who  always sided with the letter) to make concessions and remedy.
In one of the best known examples, ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', he introduces the [[Quibble (plot device)|quibble as a plot device]] to save both the spirit and the letter of the law. The moneylender [[Shylock]] has made an agreement with [[Antonio (Merchant of Venice)|Antonio]] that if he cannot repay a loan, he will have a pound of flesh from him. When the debt is not repaid in time [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]]  at first pleads for mercy in [[The Quality of Mercy (Shakespeare quote)|a famous speech]]: ''"The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes."'' (IV,i,185). When Shylock refuses, she finally saves Antonio by pointing out that Shylock's agreement with him mentioned no blood, and therefore Shylock can have his pound of flesh only if he sheds no blood.

== U.S. Constitutional law ==

Interpretations of the U.S. Constitution have historically divided on the "Letter versus Spirit" debate. For example, at the founding, the [[Federalist Party]] argued for a looser interpretation of the Constitution, granting Congress broad powers in keeping with the spirit of the broader purpose of some founders (notably including the Federalist founders' purposes). The Federalists would have represented the "spirit" aspect. In contrast, the [[Democratic-Republicans]], who favored a limited federal government, argued for the strict interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that the federal government was granted only those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and nothing not explicitly stated; they represented the "letter" interpretation.

Modern Constitutional interpretation also divides on these lines. Currently, [[Living Constitution]] scholars advocate a "spirit"-esque interpretative strategy, although one grounded in a spirit that reflects broad powers. [[Originalist]] or [[Textualist]] scholars advocate a more "letter"-based approach, arguing that the Amendment process of the Constitution necessarily forecloses broader interpretations that can be accomplished by passing an amendment.

== The Bible ==
{{See also|Law and Gospel}}

The [[Christian Bible]] references the letter and the spirit of the law in  2 Cor 3:6  NASB.  Though it is not quoted directly, the principle is applied using the words "spirit" and "letter" in context with the legalistic view of the [[Hebrew Bible]].  This is the first recorded use of the phrase.

In the [[New Testament]], [[Pharisees]] are seen as people who place the letter of the law above the spirit ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 2:3–28, 3:1–6).  Thus, "Pharisee" has entered the language as a pejorative for one who does so; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''Pharisee'' with one of the meanings as ''A person of the spirit or character commonly attributed to the Pharisees in the New Testament; a legalist or formalist''.  Pharisees are also depicted as being lawless or corrupt ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:38); the Greek word used in the verse means [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]], and the corresponding Hebrew word means fraud or injustice. However, the Hebrew word "Perushim" from which "Pharisee" is derived, actually means "separatists", referencing their focus on spiritual needs versus worldly pleasures.

In the Gospels, Jesus is often shown as being critical of Pharisees. He is more like the [[Essenes]] than the other Jewish groups of the time ([[Sadducees]], Pharisees, [[Zealots]]){{citation needed|date=October 2013}}; however, the Pharisees, like Jesus, believed in the resurrection of the dead, and in divine judgment. They advocated prayer, almsgiving and fasting as spiritual practices. The Pharisees were those who were trying to be faithful to the law given to them by God. Not all Pharisees, nor all Jews of that time, were legalistic. Though modern language has used the word Pharisee in the pejorative to describe someone who is legalistic and rigid, it is not an accurate description of all Pharisees. The argument over the "Spirit of the Law" vs. the "Letter of the Law" was part of early Jewish dialogue as well
.&lt;ref&gt;Babalonian Talmud Tractate Baba Metzia 115a, Sanhedrin 21a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] (Luke 10:25-37) is one of the New Testament texts to address this theme. The passage concerns a dialogue between Jesus and an "expert in the law" or "lawyer". As described in verse 25 ("a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him saying, Teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life?," NKJV), the intent of the dialogue was to trap Jesus into making statements contrary to the law. Jesus responds by posing the question back to the lawyer, as already having knowledge of the law, ("What is written in the law?" verse 26) The lawyer quotes Deuteronomy 6:5 "You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself.", NKJV) and Leviticus 19:18. The question "Who is my neighbor?", that follows in verse 29, is described as being asked with the goal of self-justification.

It is then that Jesus responds with the story of a man beaten by robbers who is ignored by a Priest and a Levite, but then rescued and compassionately cared for by a Samaritan. Priests and Levites were Israelites whose qualifications and duties were very meticulously set forth in Mosaic law, (Leviticus 10, and Numbers 5-8)  while Samaritans were descended from Israelites who had intermarried with their Babylonian captives and had been forced to establish a sect with an alternative interpretation of the Law. In the story, both the Priest and Levite follow their prescribed regulations dutifully, yet do not help the injured traveler, even crossing to the other side of the road to avoid possible rule violations. The Samaritan, whose very existence is based on a refutation of Jewish law, (specifically those post-Pentateuchal biblical books that identify Mount Moriah as the proper place of worship specified in Deuteronomy 12; the Samaritans considered only the Pentateuch cannon, and worshipped Yahweh in their temple on Mount Gerizim) goes above and beyond simply tending to the injured man. He takes him to an inn and gives money for the man's care, promises and then actually does return to inquire about the man, and pay any overage incurred. Jesus concludes by asking the lawyer which of the men was a "neighbor" to the beaten traveller, to which the reply was "the one who showed compassion".&lt;ref&gt;The Holy Bible, New King James Version, 1982 by Thomas Nelson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Then Jesus says to him "go and do likewise".

According to Jeremiah, "the qualities of the [[new covenant]] expounded upon  the old are : a) It will not be broken; b) Its law will be written in the heart, not merely on tablets of stone; c) The knowledge of God will deem it no longer necessary to put it into written words of instruction."&lt;ref name="NAB"&gt;"The New American Bible" Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, Nashville, Tennessee, 37202, 1976 (1970) p.949 (Jeremiah 31: 31-34). '''Note''': This bible has interpretations and references as footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luke (Lk 22, 20), and Paul, in the first epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor 11, 25), this prophecy was fulfilled only through the work of [[Jesus Christ]],&lt;ref name="NAB"/&gt; who said "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you." Christ did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. His purpose was to encourage people to look beyond the "letter of the law" to the "spirit of the law"...the principles behind the commandments and the law's intention. Jesus quotes the book of Deuteronomy and Leviticus: "All the Law can be summed up in this: to love God with all your heart, all your mind and all your soul, and to love your neighbor as yourself" (paraphrased).

== Gaming the system ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
{{see also|Legal loophole}}
[[Gaming the system]], also called "[[rules lawyer]]ing", is a pejorative phrase applied to someone who follows the letter of the law to obtain an outcome the speaker finds immoral or contrary to the spirit of the law.  There are two reasons why this can be possible.  A body of law may have been formulated in a way that permits ambiguity, or else there may be limitations in the law's scope or jurisdiction. For example, an offshore bank account can be used to reduce domestic tax obligations in some countries.

[[Image:LexisNexis.JPG|thumb|LexisNexis office in Markham, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]
Currently a division of [[RELX Group]] (formerly Reed Elsevier),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/business/the-media-business-reed-elsevier-building-big-presence-in-the-us.html?src=pm | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Edward A. | last=Gargan | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Reed-Elsevier Building Big Presence in the U.S. | date=October 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; LexisNexis was first a product of the Mead Data Central company.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twosix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2006/12/01/Lexis-Nexis-founder-Don-Wilson-dies/UPI-36121164992489/ |title=Lexis-Nexis founder Don Wilson dies |website=UPI.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Dutch publishing company [[Reed Elsevier]] has owned LexisNexis and its predecessor company since 1994. At its inception in 1970, the database was named LEXIS by Mead Data Central (MDC), a subsidiary of the [[Mead Paper|Mead Corporation]]. It was a continuation of an experiment organized by the Ohio State Bar in 1967.

On April 2, 1973, LEXIS launched publicly, offering full-text search in all Ohio and New York cases. In 1980, LEXIS completed its hand-keyed electronic archive of all U.S. federal and state cases. The NEXIS service, added that same year, gave journalists a searchable database of news articles.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the capital letters in the name; it was then standard to capitalize the names of online services.&lt;/ref&gt;  LexisNexis' world headquarters is located in [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref name="Corporate"/&gt; In 1989, MDC acquired the Michie Company, a legal publisher, from [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Macmillan Agrees to Sell Michie to Mead | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Macmillan-Agrees-to-Sell-Michie-to-Mead/id-c5740ca1895b2bc50f15e9f481161d1d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] launched the [[Lexus]] line of luxury vehicles in 1987, Mead Data Central sued for [[trademark infringement]] on the grounds that consumers of upscale products (such as lawyers) would confuse "Lexus" with "Lexis". A market research survey asked consumers to identify the spoken word "Lexis". Survey results showed that a nominal number of people thought of the computerized legal search system; a similarly small number thought of Toyota's luxury car division.&lt;ref&gt;A far greater number, although by no means a majority, thought of a television character; most thought of nothing at all.&lt;/ref&gt; A judge ruled against Toyota, and the company appealed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-04/business/fi-194_1_lexus-cars |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Distinctiveness of 'Lexis' Trademark Cited Toyota Can't Call Car 'Lexus,' Judge Says |date=January 4, 1989 |author=James Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mead Data Cent. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.'' 702 [[F.Supp.]] 1031 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Mead lost on appeal in 1989 when the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit]] held that there was little chance of consumer confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=10399856046401781554 Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales]'' 875 [[F.2d]] 1026 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the two companies have an amicable business relationship, and in 2002 implemented a joint promotion called "Win a Lexus on Lexis!"

In December 1994, Mead sold the LexisNexis system to Reed Elsevier for $1.5 billion.  The U.S. state of [[Illinois]] subsequently audited Mead's income tax returns and charged Mead an additional $4 million in income tax and penalties for the sale of LexisNexis; Mead paid the tax under protest, then sued for a refund in an Illinois state court.  On April 15, 2008, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] agreed with Mead that the Illinois courts had incorrectly applied the Court's precedents on whether Illinois could constitutionally apply its income tax to Mead, an out-of-state, Ohio-based corporation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[MeadWestvaco Corp. v. Illinois Dep't. of Revenue]]'', 553 U.S. 16 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court reversed and remanded so that the lower courts could apply the correct test and determine whether Mead and Lexis were a "unitary" business.

In 2000, LexisNexis purchased RiskWise, a [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/03/business/company-news-nexis-agrees-to-purchase-of-riskwise-international.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; NEXIS AGREES TO PURCHASE OF RISKWISE INTERNATIONAL | date=June 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000, the company acquired the American legal publisher Matthew Bender from [[Times Mirror Company|Times Mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Barringer| first = Felicity| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Times Mirror Sells Legal Unit To British-Dutch Publisher| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-02-04| date = 1998-04-28| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/business/the-media-business-times-mirror-sells-legal-unit-to-british-dutch-publisher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 it acquired a Canadian research database company, [[Quicklaw]]. In 2002, LexisNexis acquired the Ohio legal publisher Anderson Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Anderson Publishing - LexisNexis Company Information| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = https://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/anderson.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Reed Elsevier Group, parent company of LexisNexis, purchased Seisint, Inc, from founder [[Michael Brauser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/us/politics/14giuliani.html | work=The New York Times | title=Giuliani Firm Stood to Benefit From U.S. Deals, Florida Company’s Files Show | date=December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Boca Raton, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/business/company-news-reed-elsevier-to-acquire-seisint-for-775-million.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; REED ELSEVIER TO ACQUIRE SEISINT FOR $775 MILLION | date=July 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seisint housed and operated the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] (MATRIX).

On March 9, 2005, LexisNexis announced the possible theft of personal information of some Seisint users. It was originally estimated that 32,000 users were affected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/09/news/midcaps/lexisnexis/index.htm | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis customer IDs stolen | date=2005-03-09 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that number greatly increased to over 310,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/12/technology/personaltech/lexis/?cnn=yes | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis acknowledges more ID theft | date=2005-04-12 | accessdate=2010-05-07 | first1=Caleb | last1=Silver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected persons were provided with free fraud insurance and credit bureau reports for a year. However, no reports of identity theft or fraud were discovered to have stemmed from the security breach.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In February 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased [[data aggregator]] [[ChoicePoint]] (previous NYSE ticker symbol CPS) in a cash deal for US$3.6 billion.  The company was rebranded as LexisNexis Risk Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/ |title=LexisNexis Risk Solutions |publisher=LexisNexis.com |accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions bought Health Market Science (HMS), a supplier of high quality data about US healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141113/NEWS/311139944|author=Adam Rubenfire|title=LexisNexis to acquire Health Market Science|work=Modern Healthcare|date=13 November 2014| accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal content offerings==
LexisNexis services are delivered via two websites that require separate paid [[subscription]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9906/04/college.idg/index.html?iref=allsearch |work=CNN |title=Surf your way into college |date=June 4, 1999 |author=Jennifer Peltz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a company news release, LexisNexis hosts over 30 [[terabyte]]s of content on its 11 mainframes (supported by over 300 midrange UNIX servers and nearly 1,000 Windows NT servers) at its main [[datacenter]] in [[Miamisburg, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/datacenter.asp |title=Data Center Facts for LexisNexis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110101452/http://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/datacenter.asp |website=Lexisnexis.com |date=2014-03-19 |archive-date=2006-10-10|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lexis database contains current [[United States]] statutes and laws and a large volume of published case opinions dating from the 1770s to the present, as well as publicly available [[Non-publication|unpublished]] case opinions from 1980 onward. In 2000, Lexis began building a library of briefs and motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Feb_28/ai_n26775689/ |publisher=Business Network |title=LexisNexis Litigation Services Enhanced with Briefs, Motions, Pleadings |date=February 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119164740/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Feb_28/ai_n26775689/ |archivedate=November 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, Lexis also has libraries of statutes, case judgments and opinions for jurisdictions such as [[France]], [[Australia]], Canada, [[Hong Kong]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as well as databases of law review and legal journal articles for countries for which materials are available.

Previously, LexisNexis had a stripped-down free version (known as LexisOne) but this has been discontinued

===LexisNexis UK===
The organization that eventually became LexisNexis UK was founded in 1818 by Henry Butterworth (1786–1860) .&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk |title=LexisNexis UK – Butterworths – Tolley Innovative Business, Legal Solutions |website=Lexisnexis.co.uk |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil at [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|King Henry VIII School]], [[Coventry]]. After leaving Coventry he was apprenticed to and, for some time, worked for his uncle [[Joseph Butterworth]], the great law bookseller of [[Fleet Street]]. In 1818, however, disagreement between them as to the terms of partnership made Henry set up on his own account at the corner of Middle Temple Gate (7 Fleet Street), where he became the well-known Queen's Law Bookseller.

Butterworths was acquired by [[International Publishing Corporation]] in 1965; IPC was acquired by the Reed Group in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = FOB: Firms Out of Business| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/watch/fob_search_results.cfm?FOBFirmName=Butterworths&amp;FOBNote=&amp;fob-submit.x=0&amp;fob-submit.y=0&amp;fob-submit=Submit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] Professional Publishing was merged with Butterworths Scientific in 1990 to form [[Butterworth-Heinemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-1-4831-0372-3| pages = –| last = Medlik| first = S.| title = Managing Tourism| chapter = Publisher's note| date = 2016-06-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6TDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=butterworths%20scientific%20reed%20international&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Butterworths publishing business is now owned and operated in the UK by Reed Elsevier (UK) Ltd, a company in the [[Reed Elsevier]] Group. Publications continue to be produced by RELX (UK) Ltd using the "LexisNexis", "Butterworths" and "Tolley" trade marks. Such publications include ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'' and the ''[[All England Law Reports]]'', amongst others.

The Butterworths name is also used to publish works in many countries such as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

LexisNexis also produces a range of software, services and products which are designed to support the practice of the legal profession. For example, case management systems, customer relationship management systems ("CRMs"), practice management systems, electronic disclosure systems, background checking and identity verification products.&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"/&gt;

SIS was founded in 1971 by Alex and Gabrielle Sheshunoff. The company became recognized for providing guidance and analysis to the banking industry. In 1988 Thompson Media, a division of Thompson Reuters, acquired the company. Separately, the Sheshunoffs began publishing Alex Information products.

In 1995 SIS acquired A.S. Pratt &amp; Sons.

The '''line-item veto''', or '''partial veto''', is a special form of [[veto]] that authorizes a chief executive to reject particular provisions of a bill enacted by a legislature without vetoing the entire bill. Many countries have different standards for invoking the line-item veto, if it exists at all. Each country or state has its own particular requirement for overriding a line-item veto.

==Country allowing line-item veto==

===Brazil===

The [[President of Brazil]] has the power of the line-item veto over all legislation. Any provisions vetoed in such a manner are returned to the Brazilian congress, and can be overridden by a vote. An example of this came in August of 2012, when Dilma Rousseff vetoed portions of a new forestry law which had been criticized as potentially causing another wave of [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name=BrazilAmazon&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil president vetoes parts of law opening up Amazon |url=http://www.nst.com.my/latest/brazil-president-vetoes-parts-of-law-opening-up-amazon-1.87900 |publisher=New Straits Times |accessdate=16 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529050340/http://www.nst.com.my/latest/brazil-president-vetoes-parts-of-law-opening-up-amazon-1.87900 |archivedate=29 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama===

The [[President of Panama]] has the ability to partially veto portions of a bill.&lt;ref name="Panama"&gt;{{cite web|last = Jackson|first = Eric|title = With Martinelli out of the country, assembly passes nine laws in one|url = http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_16/issue_07/news_06.html|publisher = The Panama News|accessdate = 16 August 2012|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131227124111/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_16/issue_07/news_06.html|archivedate = 27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Line-item veto in the United States}}

====Federal government====
Dating to before the [[American Civil War]], U.S. Presidents including [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] have sought line-item veto powers. It was not until the [[presidency of Bill Clinton]] that Congress passed such legislation.&lt;ref name="CBSnewseludes"&gt;{{cite web|last = Madison|first = Lucy|title = 15 years after its brief existence, line-item veto eludes presidents|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57490325-503544/15-years-after-its-brief-existence-line-item-veto-eludes-presidents/|work = Political Hotsheet|publisher = CBS News|accessdate = 16 August 2012|date = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intended to control "[[Pork barrel|pork barrel spending]]", the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]] was held to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1998 ruling in ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]''. The court affirmed a lower court decision that the line-item veto was equivalent to the unilateral amendment or repeal of only parts of statutes and therefore violated the [[Presentment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Charnovitz]], "The Line Item Veto Isn't a 'Veto' at All," ''National Law Journal'', March 23, 1998, p. A17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/25/scotus.lineitem/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008092502/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/25/scotus.lineitem/ |archivedate=October 8, 2008 |title=Supreme Court Strikes Down Line-Item Veto |publisher=CNN |date=June 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/nara004.html |title=History of Line Item Veto Notices |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the prospect of granting the President of the United States a line-item veto has occasionally resurfaced in Congress, either through a constitutional amendment{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} or a differently worded bill. Most recently, the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] passed a bill on February 8, 2012, that would have granted the President a limited line-item veto; however, the bill was not heard in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref name="Housevote"&gt;{{cite web|last = Lawder|first = David|title = House votes to give Obama limited line-item veto|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-usa-congress-veto-idUSTRE81801S20120209|publisher = Reuters|accessdate = 16 August 2012|date = 8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most-commonly proposed form of the line-item veto is limited to partial vetoes of spending bills.&lt;ref name=CBSnewseludes /&gt;

====Confederate States of America====

While the [[Confederate States Constitution|Constitution of the Confederate States of America]] was largely based on the U.S. Constitution, one of the most notable departures was the granting of a line-item veto to its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp|title=Constitution of the Confederate States; March 11, 1861 |publisher=Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jefferson Davis]], however, never exercised the provision.

====State governments====

Forty-three states—all except [[Indiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[Vermont]]—give their governors some form of line-item veto power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget-tax/gubernatorial-veto-authority-with-respect-to-major.aspx |title=Gubernatorial Veto Authority with Respect to Major Budget Bill(s) |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.]] also has this power.&lt;ref&gt;[[District of Columbia Home Rule Act]] ({{USStatute|93|198|87|777|1973|12|24}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===International courts===
There are a number of international courts that are the highest courts of appeal for members of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS), [[European Union]] (EU), and some of the countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] respectively. However, the members of those organisations do sometimes have high courts of their own and their jurisdiction may be limited: for example the EU's court of justice can only interpret EU law and treaties, domestic cases cannot be appealed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12678">[[File:Minimum Wage Divided by Median Wage in OECD Countries 2011 Canada Highlighted.jpg|thumb|Minimum wage levels in developed economies as a share of median full-time wage. The relative minimum wage ratio in Canada is shown in black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIN2AVE |title=OECD Statistics |publisher=Stats.oecd.org |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=.95]]
Under the [[Canadian Constitution]], the responsibility for enacting and enforcing [[labour law]]s, including the [[minimum wage]], rests with the ten [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]] as well as the three [[Territories of Canada|territories]] which have been granted this power by federal legislation. Some provinces allow lower wages to be paid to liquor servers and other gratuity earners or to inexperienced employees.

The [[Government of Canada|federal government]] in past years set its own minimum wage rates for workers in [[Canadian federalism|federal jurisdiction]] industries (railways for example). In 1996, however, the [[Canada Labour Code#Part 3: Employment Standards Act|federal minimum wage]] was re-defined to be the general adult minimum wage rate of the province or territory where the work is performed.&lt;ref name="minwage"/&gt; This means, for example, that a railway company could not legally pay a worker in British Columbia less than C$12.65 per hour regardless of the worker's experience.

==Demographics==

In 2013, 39.8% of minimum wage workers were between the ages of 15 and 19; in 1997, it was 36%. 50.2% of workers in this age group were paid minimum wage in 2013, an increase from 31.5% in 1997. Statistics Canada notes that "youth,  women and persons with a low level of education were the groups most likely to be paid at minimum wage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galarneau|first1=Diane|last2=Fecteau|first2=Eric|title=The ups and downs of minimum wage|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2014001/article/14035-eng.htm#a7|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minimum wage levels by jurisdiction ==

Assuming a 40-hour workweek and 52 paid weeks a year, the annual gross income of an individual earning the lowest minimum wage in Canada is C$22,880 ''(in Nova Scotia)'' and the highest minimum wage is C$31,200 ''(in Alberta)''.&lt;ref name="minwage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srv116.services.gc.ca/dimt-wid/sm-mw/rpt1.aspx?lang=eng#ftb2-ref |title=Current And Forthcoming Minimum Hourly Wage Rates For Experienced Adult Workers in Canada |publisher=services.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table lists the hourly minimum wages for adult workers in each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] of Canada. The provinces which have their minimum wages in bold allow for lower wages under circumstances which are described under the "Comments" heading.

== Controversies ==
Critics of the minimum wage, such as the [[Canadian Federation of Independent Business]] and the [[C. D. Howe Institute]], contend that minimum wage laws actually hurt the very people they purport to help by forcing employers to raise prices, reduce staff, or close down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marchand |first1=Joseph |title=Thinking about Minimum Wage Increases in Alberta: Theoretically, Empirically, and Regionally |url=https://www.cdhowe.org/public-policy-research/thinking-about-minimum-wage-increases-alberta-theoretically-empirically-and-regionally |publisher=CD Howe Institute |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic of minimum wage increases, University of Laval economics professor Stephen Gordon, has argued that the poverty-reducing impacts of the minimum wage are overstated. In his National Post article Gordon writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The case for increasing the minimum wage has problems in both dimensions: the losses in total income are typically underestimated (when they are not being dismissed out of hand) and the putative reductions in income inequality are almost certainly being overstated. Let’s examine total incomes first. Labour demand curves slope down: everything else being equal, higher wages reduce the quantity of labour employers demand. And fewer people with jobs means less total income. If the theoretical point is clear — and I’m not aware of a compelling theoretical argument suggesting that employers will react to higher minimum wage by hiring more workers — the empirical evidence is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/stephen-gordon-the-high-cost-of-minimum-wage|title=The high cost of minimum wage|author= Stephen Gordon|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other Canadian economists have supported minimum wage increases. David Green, a professor and director at the Vancouver School of Economics, has conducted extensive research on the minimum wage’s effects on the economy. In his work entitled “The Case for Increasing Minimum Wage”, Green presents a rebuttal to the critics of the minimum wage stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Claims that increases in the minimum wage will generate huge efficiency costs for the economy and mass unemployment are not credible. While estimates of employment losses from minimum wage increases for teenagers in Canada exist, the estimated effects on adult employment are minimal at best. Those results cannot be translated into big costs for the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/BC%20Office/2015/04/CCPA-BC-Case-for-Incr-Minimum-Wage_0.pdf|title=The Case for Increasing the Minimum Wage|author= David Green|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some cases, determinations of nationality are also governed by [[public international law]]—for example, by [[Treaty|treaties]] on [[statelessness]] and the [[European Convention on Nationality]].

Nationality differs technically and legally from [[citizenship]], which is a different legal relationship between a person and a country. The noun ''national'' can include both citizens and non-citizens. The most common distinguishing feature of citizenship is that citizens have the right to participate in the [[Politics|political]] life of the state, such as by [[voting]] or [[Candidate|standing for election]]. However, in most modern countries all nationals are citizens of the state, and full citizens are always nationals of the state.&lt;ref name="Vonk2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;

In older texts, the word ''nationality'' rather than ''ethnicity'', often used to refer to an [[ethnic group]] (a group of people who share a common ethnic identity, language, culture, descent, history, and so forth). This older meaning of ''nationality'' is not defined by political borders or [[passport]] ownership and includes nations that lack an [[sovereign state|independent state]] (such as the [[Aramean people|Arameans]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[English people|English]], [[Basques]], [[Catalans]], [[Kurds]], [[Kabyle people|Kabyles]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Berbers]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Kashmiris]],
[[Palestinians]], [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]], [[Tamils]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Inuit]], [[Copts]], [[Māori people|Māori]], [[Sikhs]], [[Wakhi people|Wakhi]] and [[Székelys]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Individuals may also be considered nationals of groups with [[autonomous administrative division|autonomous status]] that [[devolution|have ceded some power]] to a larger government.

== International law ==
In international law, nationality is the status or relationship that gives a nation the right to protect a person from other nations.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  Diplomatic and [[consular protection]] are dependent upon this relationship between the person and the state.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadelbach |first1=Stefan |editor1-last=Ehlers|editor1-first=Dirk |title=European Fundamental Rights and Freedoms |chapter=Part V: Citizenship Rights in Europe |date=2007|publisher=De Gruyter Recht |location=Berlin|isbn=9783110971965|pages=547–548|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHep8q-OxboC&amp;pg=PA547}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person's status as being the national of a country is used to resolve the [[conflict of laws]].&lt;ref name="Bast" /&gt;

Nationality is also the status that allows a nation to grant rights to the subject and to impose obligations upon the subject.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  In most cases, no rights or obligations are automatically attached to this status, although the status is a necessary precondition for any rights and obligations created by the state.&lt;ref name=Bast&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= von Bogdandy|editor1-first=Armin|editor2-last=Bast|editor2-first=Jürgen |title=Principles of European Constitutional Law.|date=2009|publisher=Hart Pub.|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847315502|pages=449–451|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the broad limits imposed by few treaties and international law, states may freely define who their nationals are and are not.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  However, since the [[Nottebohm case|''Nottebohm'' case]], other states are only required to respect their claim to protect an alleged national if the nationality is based on a true social bond.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  In the case of dual nationality, states may determine the most effective nationality for a person, to determine which state's laws are most relevant.&lt;ref name="Bast" /&gt;  There are also limits on removing a person's status as a national. Article 15 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "Everyone has the right to a nationality," and "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality."

== National law ==
Nationals normally have the [[right of return|right to enter or return]] to the country they belong to. [[Passports]] are issued to nationals of a state, rather than only to citizens, because the passport is the travel document used to enter the country. However, nationals may not have the [[right of abode]] (the right to live permanently) in the countries that grant them passports.

==Nationality versus citizenship==
Conceptually, [[citizenship]] is focused on the internal political life of the state and nationality is a matter of international dealings.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"&gt;Turner, Bryan S; Isin, Engin F. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gtiZqLcJYZEC&amp;pg=PA278 Handbook of Citizenship Studies]''. SAGE; 2003-01-29. {{ISBN|9780761968580}}. p. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the concept of full citizenship encompasses not only active political rights, but full [[civil rights]] and [[social rights]].&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;  Nationality is a [[necessary and sufficient condition|necessary but not sufficient condition]] to exercise full political rights within a state or other [[polity]].&lt;ref name="Vonk2012" /&gt;  Nationality is required for full citizenship, and some people have no nationality in international law. A person who is denied full citizenship or nationality is commonly called a stateless person.

Historically, the most significant difference between a national and a citizen is that the citizen has the right to vote for elected officials, and to be elected.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;  This distinction between full citizenship and other, lesser relationships goes back to antiquity. Until the 19th and 20th centuries, it was typical for only a small percentage of people who belonged to a city or state to be full citizens. In the past, most people were excluded from citizenship on the basis of gender, socioeconomic class, ethnicity, religion, and other factors. However, they held a legal relationship with their government akin to the modern concept of nationality.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;

[[United States nationality law]] defines some persons born in U.S. outlying possessions as U.S. nationals but not citizens. [[British nationality law]] defines six classes of British national, among which "British citizen" is one class (having the [[right of abode]] in the United Kingdom, along with some "British subjects"). Similarly, in the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as [[Taiwan]], the status of [[national without household registration]] applies to people who have [[Republic of China nationality law|Republic of China nationality]], but do not have an automatic entitlement to enter or reside in the [[Taiwan Area]], and do not qualify for civic rights and duties there. Under the nationality laws of [[Mexican nationality law|Mexico]], [[Colombian nationality law|Colombia]], and some other Latin American countries, nationals do not become citizens until they turn 18.

==Nationality versus ethnicity==
{{Main|Ethnic nationalism}}

Nationality is sometimes used simply as an alternative word for [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] or national origin, just as some people assume that citizenship and nationality are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Oommen, T. K. |title=Citizenship, nationality, and ethnicity: reconciling competing identities |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1997 |page=6 |isbn=0-7456-1620-8 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, the [[cognate]] word for ''nationality'' in local language may be understood as a synonym of ethnicity or as an identifier of cultural and family-based self-determination, rather than on relations with a state or current government. For example, some [[Kurds]] say that they have Kurdish nationality, even though there is no Kurdish [[sovereign state]] at this time in history.

[[File:Russian birth certificate of Michael Lucas.JPG|thumb|A Soviet birth certificate, in which the ''nacional'nost' '' of both parents (here both [[Jews|Jewish]]) was recorded. These records were subsequently used to determine the ethnicity of the child, as specified in his internal passport.]]
In the context of former [[Soviet Union]] and former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], "nationality" is often used as translation of the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''nacional'nost' '' and [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''narodnost'', which were the terms used in those countries for [[ethnic group]]s and local affiliations within the member states of the [[federation]]. In the Soviet Union, more than 100 such groups were formally recognized. Membership in these groups was identified on Soviet [[internal passport]]s, and recorded in [[census]]es in both the USSR and Yugoslavia. In the early years of the Soviet Union's existence, ethnicity was usually determined by the person's native language, and sometimes through religion or cultural factors, such as clothing.&lt;ref name="Slezkine"&gt;Slezkine, Yuri (Summer 1994)  "The USSR as a Communal Apartment, or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism" ''Slavic Review'' Vol. 53, No. 2, pp. 414-452&lt;/ref&gt;  Children born after the revolution were categorized according to their parents' recorded ethnicities. Many of these ethnic groups are still recognized by modern [[Russia]] and other countries.

Similarly, the term ''[[List of ethnic groups in China|nationalities of China]]'' refers to ethnic and cultural groups in China. Spain is one nation, made up of [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]], which are not politically recognized as nations (state), but can be considered smaller nations within the Spanish nation. Spanish law recognises the autonomous communities of [[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] as "[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]]" (''nacionalidades'').

==Nationality versus national identity==
[[National identity]] is a person's subjective sense of belonging to one state or to one nation. A person may be a national of a state, in the sense of being its citizen, without subjectively or emotionally feeling a part of that state, for example many migrants in Europe often identify with their ancestral and/or religious background rather than with the state of which they are citizens. Conversely, a person may feel that he belongs to one state without having any legal relationship to it. For example, children who were brought to the U.S. illegally when quite young and grow up there with little contact with their native country and its culture often have a national identity of feeling American, despite legally being nationals of a different country.

==Dual nationality==
[[Multiple citizenship|Dual nationality]] is when a single person has a formal relationship with two separate, sovereign states.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;  This might occur, for example, if a person's parents are nationals of separate countries, and the mother's country claims all offspring of the mother's as their own nationals, but the father's country claims all offspring of the father's.

Nationality, with its historical origins in allegiance to a sovereign monarch, was seen originally as a permanent, inherent, unchangeable condition, and later, when a change of allegiance was permitted, as a strictly exclusive relationship, so that becoming a national of one state required rejecting the previous state.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;

Dual nationality was considered a problem that caused conflict between states and sometimes imposed mutually exclusive requirements on affected people, such as simultaneously serving in two countries' military forces. Through the middle of the 20th century, many international agreements were focused on reducing the possibility of dual nationality. Since then, many accords recognizing and regulating dual nationality have been formed.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;

==Statelessness==
[[Statelessness]] is the condition in which an individual has no formal or protective relationship with any state. This might occur, for example, if a person's parents are nationals of separate countries, and the mother's country rejects all offspring of mothers married to foreign fathers, but the father's country rejects all offspring born to foreign mothers. Although this person may have an emotional national identity, he or she may not legally be the national of any state.

Another stateless situation arises when a person holds a travel document (passport) which recognizes the bearer as having the nationality of a "state" which is not internationally recognized, has no entry in the International Organization for Standardization's country list, is not a member of the United Nations, etc.  In the current era, persons native to Taiwan who hold Republic of China passports are one example.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|quote=The Republic of China passport carried by native Taiwanese people clearly indicates the bearer's nationality as 'Republic of China.' Under international standards however, such a nationality designation does not exist. This is explained as follows.  ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are three-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent countries, territories, etc. These three-letter abbreviations have been formally adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as the official designation(s) of a 'recognized nationality' for use in manufacturing machine-readable passports, carried by travelers in order to deal with entry/exit procedures at customs authorities in all nations/territories of the world.  According to these three-letter ISO country codes adopted by ICAO, the 'Republic of China' is not a recognized nationality in the international community, and thus there is no 'ROC' entry.

Page 172.&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal term from [[common law|common-law]] jurisdictions referring to the various published collections of reports of [[English law|English cases]] in various courts from the Middle Ages to the 1860s, when law reporting was officially taken over by the [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting]], for example [[Edmund F. Moore]]'s ''Reports of Cases Heard and Determined by the Judicial Committee and the Lords of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council on Appeal from the Supreme and Sudder Dewanny Courts in the East Indies'' published in London from 1837 to 1873, referred to as ''[[Moore's Indian Appeals]]'' and cited for example as: ''Moofti Mohummud Ubdoollah'' v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4280">An '''organic law''' is a [[law]], or system of laws, that form the foundation of a [[government]], [[corporation]] or any other organization's body of rules. A [[constitution]] is a particular form of organic law for a sovereign state.
==By country==
===France===
Under the current [[Constitution of France]], organic laws are a short, fixed list of statutes (in 2005, there were about 30 of them), whose existence is provisioned by the text of the Constitution itself. According to the framing of the French Constitution (especially its [[Constitution of France#Impact with respect to personal freedoms|preambles]]), they are of constitutional scope and have constitutional force and so overrule ordinary statutes. They are enacted by the [[Parliament of France]] in the same way except that the [[Constitutional Council of France]] must be consulted before any organic law is enacted.

Organic laws allow flexibility if needed. An important category is the legislative process for enacting the budgets of the [[Cabinet of France#Budget|French state]] and French [[social security]]. Other organic laws give the practical procedures for various [[election]]s. They reduce the need for amendments to the constitution.

===Spain===
{{Main|Organic Law (Spain)}}
Under the current [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]], an Organic Law has an intermediate status between that of an ordinary law and of the constitution itself. It must be passed by an absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]. The Spanish Constitution specifies that some areas of law must be regulated by this procedure, such as the laws developing fundamental rights and freedoms recognized in the first section of Chapter Two of Title I of the Constitution, as well as the laws that approve the [[Statute of Autonomy|Statutes of Autonomy]] of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]], among others. Prior to the 1978 constitution, the concept did not exist in Spain, but it is inspired by the similar concept in the 1958 French Constitution.

===United States===

The organic laws of the United States of America can be found in Volume One of the United States Code which contains the general and permanent laws of the United States.

'''Otto Kirchheimer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪɐ̯çˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; 11 November 1905, [[Heilbronn]] – 22 November 1965, [[New York City]]) was a [[Germany|German]] jurist of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish ancestry]] and political scientist of the [[Frankfurt School]] whose work essentially covered the [[State (polity)|state]] and its [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arzt |first=Donna E. |chapter=Otto Kirchheimer: Critic of the Administration of Justice |title=Der Einfluß deutscher Emigranten auf die Rechtsentwicklung in den USA und in Deutschland |editor-last=Lutter |editor-first=Marcus |year=1993 |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |isbn=3-16-146080-4 |pages=33–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchheimer worked as a research analyst at the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the forerunner of the [[CIA]], starting in [[World War II]] and continuing to 1952.&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9955.html |title=Secret Reports on Nazi Germany: The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
He is father of the concept of a "[[big tent|catch-all party]] (''Allerweltspartei'')". Otto Kirchheimer's conception of the catch-all party was part of his more comprehensive theory of party transformation, encompassing four interrelated political processes. By tracing the development of the catch-all thesis and placing it within the wider context of Kirchheimer's complete work, it is possible to reconstruct a more precise understanding of what Kirchheimer meant by the catch-all concept, which itself remains highly contested. Kirchheimer's anxiety about modern democracy originated with what he saw as the vanishing of principled opposition within parliament and society, and the reduction of politics to the mere management of the state. This leads to collusion of political parties and the state, severing of the societal links of party organisations, and erosion of the classic separation of powers. Vanishing opposition, cartelisation and professionalisation of politics pits citizens against a powerful state, which increases political cynicism and apathy. Kirchheimer's comprehensive approach remains relevant to much of the contemporary debate about the transformation of Western political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krouwel|first=André|title=Otto Kirchheimer and the Catch-all Party|journal=West European Politics|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|page=23|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380512331341091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Research Fund (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) is funding the research and editorial work for an edition in five volumes of the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (Collected Writings) of Otto Kirchheimer. The project began in late 2015 at [[Greifswald University]] and is scheduled to take about three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buchstein.wordpress.com/forschung|title=Prof. Dr. Hubertus Buchstein|website=Greifswald University|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5604">In [[United States constitutional law]], '''police power''' is the capacity of the [[U.S. state|states]] to [[Regulation|regulate]] behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the [[health]], [[safety]], [[Morality|morals]], and [[Common good|general welfare]] of their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title =Police Power| encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica|url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9060615/police-power| accessdate = 2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states or to the people. This implies that the Federal Government does not possess all possible powers, because most of these are reserved to the State governments, and others are reserved to the people.

Police power is exercised by the legislative and executive branches of the various states through the enactment and [[law enforcement|enforcement of law]]s. States have the power to compel [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to these laws through whatever measures they see fit, provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the [[United States Constitution]] or in the various state constitutions, and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include [[Sanctions (law)|legal sanctions]], [[violence#Law|physical means]], and other forms of [[coercion]] and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.

== Origins ==

The authority for use of police power under American Constitutional law has its roots in [[English law#Common law|English]] and European common law traditions.&lt;ref name=Pox&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox|date=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more fundamentally, use of police power draws on two (Latin) principles, ''[[sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas]]'' ("use that which is yours so as not to injure others"), and ''[[salus populi suprema lex esto]]'' ("the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law"), to justify restriction of individual liberties in order to protect the general welfare.&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; The concept of police power in America was further expanded in a series of notable court cases in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, including the landmark 1851 [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]], and the 1905 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]].

== Restrictions ==
{{Geographical imbalance|United States|section|date=July 2017}}
Due to the nebulous definition of the police power, restrictions on its use are few and far between. In Commonwealth v. Alger, Chief Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] wrote that "It is much easier to perceive and realize the existence and sources of [the police power] than to mark its boundaries, or prescribe limits to exercise."&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; However, according to historian Michael Willrich, "Shaw recognized certain constitutional restraints on police power, but they were few. Laws must apply equally to all under like circumstances... government interferences with individual rights must be 'reasonable' – they must have a clear relation to some legitimate legislative purpose. Beyond those outer limits... most courts stayed out of the way of state police power."&lt;ref name="Pox 302"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox |date=2012|publisher=Penguin |location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later court cases have expanded somewhat on these restrictions by limiting the ability of states to infringe upon implied constitutional rights and by demanding a stricter standard of [[Legal burden of proof|reasonability]], but regulation of police power remains fairly minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Galva, Jorge E., Christopher Atchinson, and Samuel Levey. "Public Health Strategy and the Police Powers of the State." Public Health Reports 120.1 (2005): 20–27. National Center for Biotechnology Information. Web. 18 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of United States land-use planning authority ==
The police power is the basis for [[land-use planning]] authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and municipalities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain. The court decision in the case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]] was related to land use planning and dealt with the construction of a wharf on privately owned tidelands around Boston Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding the Law of Zoning and Land Use Controls, Barlow Burke, Lexisnexis, Chapter 1, Published 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political philosophy''', also known as '''political theory''', is the study of topics such as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of laws by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.

In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "[[political ideology]]".

{{Further|History of political thought}}

=== Ancient traditions ===

==== Ancient India ====
[[Indian political philosophy]]  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between (1) nation and state (2) religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. ''Mantranga,'' the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).

[[Chanakya]] was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|last=Boesche|first=Roger|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0739106074&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-0401-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangarajan|first1=L N|title=The Arthashastra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jbzZkoR36QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184750119|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=D.

==== Ancient China ====
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]]. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but was replaced by State Confucianism in the [[Han Dynasty]]. Prior to China's adoption of [[communism]], State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsü|first=Leonard Shihlien|title=The political philosophy of Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FWFtQIyun-8C|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36154-5|pages=xvii–xx|quote=The importance of a scientific study of Confucian political philosophy could hardly be overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient Greece ====
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of [[ancient Greece]], where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato.&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=Mabel Lewis|title=Ideas of the great philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vi7cQMw8SwYC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|page=59|quote=...

One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's ''Republic'',&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"/&gt; which was followed by [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle: political philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9BDmX3FBbS4C&amp;pg=PA3|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878200-1|page=3|quote=To understand and assess Aristotle's contributions to political thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman political philosophy was influenced by the [[Stoics]] and the Roman statesman [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radford|first=Robert T.|title=Cicero: a study in the origins of republican philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cKLGcvuYxQC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1467-1|page=1|quote=His most lasting political contribution is in his work on political philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saint Augustine ====

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====
{{main|Treatise on Law}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law|law]]. According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:

# Eternal law ("the divine government of everything")
# Divine positive law (having been "posited" by God; external to human nature)
# [[Natural law]] (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature)
# Human law (what we commonly call "[[law]]"—including [[customary law]]; the law of the ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'')

Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.

Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the "rationalist" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AkyupJn81RMC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=153|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]—i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripaetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occurs because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-Fārābī {{!}} Muslim philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-22|title=Averroes|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Averroes&amp;oldid=837663527|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghazālī {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the "Book of Government" in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.e. how to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-30|title=Siyasatnama|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siyasatnama&amp;oldid=788295179|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the [[Turkmens]] who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-al-Mulk-Seljuq-vizier|title=Niẓām al-Mulk {{!}} Seljuq vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ibn Khaldun ====

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself," the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Plough, Sword, and Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&amp;pg=PA239|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28702-7|page=239|quote=Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in [[Europe]] was heavily influenced by [[Christian]] thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s though subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koetsier|first=L. S.|title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7uLE3DynB0YC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4122-1440-7|page=19|quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of natural law. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] through [[Muslim]] [[Spain]], along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|page=346|quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown.

[[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

==== Niccolò Machiavelli ====

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310–12|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Enlightenment ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]] led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of "state" and "government." It was decided that "state" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, [[history|historians]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206–07|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1–2|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the [[United States]]: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=69|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Locke ====

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===
The [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism—developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was "standing on its head", "the right side up again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1–4|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]—and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)—on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the events of [[May 1968]] led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a "return to [[Hegel]]". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].

A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely "liberty as non-domination." Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.

Current emphasis on "commoditization of the everyday" has been decried by many contemporary theorists, some of them arguing the full brunt of it would be felt in ten years' time. "Pricing" such ethical categories like personal relations or sex, though always present, pushed by media agenda, is thus seen as crossing boundaries and having adverse societal and philosophical consequences.

A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in [[Germany]], but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential political philosophers ==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.
* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of conservative thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].
* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
* [[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]—a mainstay of socialism—would lead to a "total" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.
* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the "cunning" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]].
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].
* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.
* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be "Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]" and "Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.
* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.
* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.
* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.
* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.
* [[Max Stirner]]: Important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]].
* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[Neo-Conservativism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].
* [[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].
* [[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)]]: French Enlightenment writer, poet, and philosopher famous for his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.
* [[Bernard Williams]]: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy ''In the Beginning was the Deed'' has been seen—along with the works of [[Raymond Geuss]]—as a key foundational work on political realism.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: A French political scientist and diplomat, known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]''.

The term '''postfeminism''' (alternatively rendered as '''post-feminism''') is used to describe reactions against contradictions and absences in [[feminism]], especially [[second-wave feminism]] and [[third-wave feminism]]. The term ''postfeminism'' is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as [[Fourth-wave feminism|4th wave-feminism]], and "women of color feminism" (e.g. hooks, 1996; Spivak, 1999).

The ideology of postfeminism is recognized by its contrast with prevailing or preceding feminism. Postfeminism strives towards the next stage in gender-related progress, and as such is often conceived as in favor of a society that is no longer defined by [[gender binary]] and [[gender role]]s. A postfeminist is a person who believes in, promotes, or embodies any of various ideologies springing from the feminism of the 1970s, whether supportive of or antagonistic towards classical feminism.

Postfeminism can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, [[popular culture]] and [[femininity]]. Postfeminism may also present a critique of second-wave feminism or third-wave feminism by questioning their binary thinking and essentialism, their vision of sexuality, and their perception of relationships between femininity and feminism. It may also complicate or even deny entirely the notion that absolute gender equality is necessary, desirable or realistically achievable.

Second-wave feminism is often critiqued for being too "white", too "straight", and too "liberal", thus resulting in the needs of women from marginalized groups and cultures being ignored. However, since [[intersectionality]] is a product of third-wave feminism, the references to such as postfeminist are open to challenge and may be more properly considered feminist.

==History of the term==
While ''postfeminism'' was first used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.  It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gender.cawater-info.net/knowledge_base/rubricator/feminism_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the meaning of postfeminism has broadened in scope, encompassing many different meanings, as is the case with feminism. Within feminist literature, definitions tend to fall into two main categories: 1) “death of feminism”, “anti-feminism”, “feminism is irrelevant now” and 2) the next stage in feminism, or feminism that intersects with other “post-” philosophies/theories, such as [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

In 1919, a journal was launched in which "female literary radicals" stated "'we're interested in people now—not in men and women'", that "moral, social, economic, and political standards 'should not have anything to do with sex'", that it would "be 'pro-woman without being anti-man'", and that "their stance [is called] 'post-feminist'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott|Cott, Nancy F.]], ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, [2d printing?] pbk 1987 ({{ISBN|0-300-04228-0}})) (cloth {{ISBN|0-300-03892-5}}), p. 282 (author prof. American studies &amp; history, Yale Univ.) (book is largely on U.S. feminism in 1910s–1920s) (n. 23 (at end) omitted) (n. 23 (in full): "23. ''Judy'' 1:1 (Jun. 1919); 2:3 (1919), n.p., SL." ("SL" in small capitals &amp; abbreviating "The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts", per ''id.'', p. 285 (Abbreviations Used in Notes (Libraries)))).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against [[second-wave feminism]]. Postfeminism is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth, ''Lacan and Postfeminism'' (Icon Books, 2000), {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;Modleski, Tania.

New York: Routledge, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Amelia. "Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art," New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, Eds. Joana Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer and Arlene Raven. New York: HarperCollins, 1994. 16–41, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the popularization of this term, in both the academic world as well as the media world. It was seen as a term of both commendation and scorn. [[Toril Moi]], a professor at Duke University, originally coined the term in 1985 in Sexual/Textual politics to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality based on "liberal" feminism and difference-based or "radical" feminism. There is confusion surrounding the intended meaning of "post" in the context of "postfeminism". This confusion has plagued the very meaning of "postfeminism" since the 1990s. While the term has seemed on the one hand to announce the end of feminism, on the other hand it has itself become a site of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4149214|title = Feminism, Ethics, and History, or What is the "Post" in Postfeminism?|journal = Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 29–44|last1 = Kavka|first1 = Misha|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, feminist history is characterized by the struggle to find out the present situation—often articulated as a concern about whether there is still such a thing called "feminism"—by writing in the past. It is here that the meaning of "post" as a historical break is troubling, for "post" offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with "post" when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The early part of the 1980s was when the media began labeling teenage women and women in their twenties the "postfeminist generation". After twenty years, the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women, "who are thought to benefit from the women's movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change", Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts. Postfeminism is a highly debated topic since it implies that feminism is "dead" and "because the equality it assumes is largely a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Feminists or "Postfeminists"?: Young Women's Attitudes toward Feminism and Gender Relations | journal = Gender and Society | year = 2003 | first = Pamela | last = Aronson | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 903–22 | doi=10.1177/0891243203257145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diane Davis|Prof. D. Diane Davis]], postfeminism is just a continuation of what first- and second-wave feminisms want.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Debra Diane, ''Breaking Up [at] Totality: A Rhetoric of Laughter'' (Carbondale: Southern Ill. Univ. Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|0-8093-2228-5}})), p. 141 n. 8 (brackets in title so in original) (author asst. prof. rhetoric, Univ. of Iowa).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted at Kent State University narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label "feminist" was disliked due to negative stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elaine J.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Marnie Salupo|date=2003|title=The Myth of Postfeminism|jstor=3594675|journal=Gender and Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=878–902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=rodriguez&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|last=Abbott|first=Pamela|last2=Tyler|first2=Melissa|last3=Wallace|first3=Claire|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781134382453|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of postfeminist work==

In her 1994 book ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] considers much of modern academic [[feminist theory]] and the feminist movement to be [[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]. She labels this "[[gender feminism]]" and proposes "[[equity feminism]]"—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;Hoff Sommers, Christina, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.&lt;ref name=Flood&gt;Flood, Michael (7 July 2004). "Backlash: Angry men's movements", in Stacey Elin Rossi, ed.: The Battle and Backlash Rage On. N.p.: XLibris, 273. {{ISBN|1-4134-5934-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncovering the Right—Female Anti-Feminism for Fame and Profit |url=http://organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215141226/http://www.organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary feminists, such as [[Katha Pollitt]] or [[Nadine Strossen]], consider feminism to hold simply that "women are people." Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be ''sexist'' rather than ''feminist''.&lt;ref name=Pollitt&gt;Pollitt, Katha, ''Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism '' (Vintage, 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-679-76278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strossen&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights'' (Prentice Hall &amp; IBD, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-684-19749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amelia Jones]] has authored post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s/1990s and portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and criticized it using generalizations.

One of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article "Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation", published in ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Ruth. The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America. New York: Viking, 2000, 275, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Faludi]], in her 1991 book ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', argued that a backlash against second wave feminism in the 1980s had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. She argued that it constructed the [[women's liberation movement]] as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. She also argued that many of these problems were illusory, constructed by the media without reliable evidence. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.&lt;ref name=Faludi_Backlash&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women'' (Three Rivers Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela McRobbie]] argued that adding the prefix ''post-'' to ''feminism'' undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie's opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]], [[Sex and the City]]'', and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Female characters like Bridget Jones and [[Carrie Bradshaw]] claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McRobbie | first = Angela | author-link = Angela McRobbie | title = Post‐feminism and popular culture | journal = [[Feminist Media Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 255&amp;ndash;264 | doi = 10.1080/1468077042000309937 | date = 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of post feminism can be found in pop culture. Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feasey|first=Rebecca|date=7 August 2010|title=Charmed: Why Teen Television Appeals to Women|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=34:1|pages=2–9|doi=10.3200/JPFT.34.1.2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular shows from the 90s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such shows and movies include ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Xena: Warrior Princess]], [[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]],'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' Another example is ''Sex and the City''. Carrie Bradshaw from ''Sex and the City'' is an example of a character living a post feminist life. While her character attempts to live a sexually liberated lifestyle, Bradshaw is stuck endlessly pursuing the love and validation of a man. The balance between Bradshaw's independent life as a successful columnist and desire to find a husband exemplifies the tension of post feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jane|date=August 2006|title=Sex and the City, Feminist Media Studies|url=|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=5|pages=37–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politicsandculture.org/2009/11/09/post-feminism-in-popular-culture-a-potential-for-critical-resistance/|title=Post feminism in popular culture: A potential for critical resistance?|date=2009-11-09|work=Politics and Culture|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist literature—also known as [[Chick lit|chicklit]]—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/writingpostfeminism/gutsy|title=What is chick-lit? {{!}} Electronic Book Review|website=www.electronicbookreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can also be found in ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]''. The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series' protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls. The materialism and performance from the girls in ''Pretty Little Liars'' critiques the notion that society has full gender equality, and thus offers a critique of postfeminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitney|first1=Sarah|title=Kisses, Bitches: Pretty Little Liars Frames Postfeminism's Adolescent Girl|journal=Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|date=11 November 2017|volume=36|issue=2|pages=353–377|doi=10.1353/tsw.2017.0026|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/677146|language=en|issn=1936-1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on print jewelry advertisements in Singapore, Michelle Lazar analyses how the construction of 'postfeminist' femininity has given rise to a [[neo-liberal]] hybrid "pronounced sense of self or 'I-dentity'". She states that the increasing number of female wage earners has led to advertisers updating their image of women but that "through this hybrid postfeminist I-dentity, advertisers have found a way to reinstall a new normativity that coexists with the status quo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lazar | first = Michelle | title = Recuperating feminism, reclaiming femininity: Hybrid postfeminist I-dentity in consumer advertisements | journal = [[Gender and Language]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–224 | doi = 10.1558/genl.v8i2.205 | year = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist ads and fashion have been criticized for using femininity as a commodity veiled as liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanaejournal.hu/vol7no2/kulcsar|title=AMERICANA: "A Critique of Post-feminism" by Zsófia Kulcsár|website=americanaejournal.hu|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primogeniture''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|p|r|aɪ|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|tʃ|ər}}) is the right, by law or custom, of the paternally acknowledged, [[wikt:firstborn|firstborn]] son to [[inheritance|inherit]] his parent's entire or main [[estate (law)|estate]], in preference to daughters, elder illegitimate sons, [[cadet branch|younger sons]] and collateral relatives; in some cases the estate may instead be the inheritance of [[#Absolute primogeniture|the firstborn child]] or occasionally [[#Matrilineal primogeniture|the firstborn daughter]]. The descendant (often the son) of a deceased elder sibling (typically elder brother) inherits before a living younger sibling by right of substitution for the deceased heir. In the absence of any children, brothers succeed, individually, to the inheritance by seniority of age (subject to substitution). Among siblings, sons usually inherit before daughters. In the absence of male descendants in the male-line, there are variations of primogeniture which allocate the inheritance to a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture).

The principle has applied in history to inheritance of real property (land) as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.

Variations on primogeniture modify the right of the first-born son to the entirety of a family's inheritance (see [[appanage]]) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute primogeniture). Most [[monarchies in Europe|monarchies in Western Europe]] have eliminated male preference in succession: [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Monarchy of Norway|Norway]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

Some monarchies have succession rules contrasting greatly with primogeniture. Currently, [[succession to the Saudi Arabian throne]] uses a form of lateral [[agnatic seniority]], as did the [[Kievan Rus']] (see [[Rota system]]), the early [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (see [[Tanistry]]), the [[Mongol Empire]] (see [[Order of succession#Lateral succession|lateral succession]]) or the later [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Line of succession to the former Ottoman throne#Succession practices|succession practices]]).

===Absolute primogeniture===
&lt;!-- This section is forward referenced and linked from [[Westeros]] and [[Hundred Years' War]]--&gt;
''Absolute'', ''equal'', or ''lineal primogeniture'' is a form of primogeniture in which sex is irrelevant for inheritance. No modern monarchy before 1980 practiced this form of primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Poumarede (1972), the [[Basque people|Basques]] of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] transmitted title and property to the firstborn regardless of sex.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W4H-4H5DYN9-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1113676711&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=4ae9185f30a93cc3f5c45dbfcec3b167 |title=Succession strategies in the Pyrenees in the 19th century: The Basque case |doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2005.03.002 |volume=10 |journal=The History of the Family |pages=271–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher [[nobility]] and free families of the [[early middle ages|early]] and [[high middle ages]] followed this custom.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt; The Navarrese monarchy, however, was inherited by dynasties from outside of [[Navarre]], which followed different successional laws, usually male preference primogeniture. Eventually only the Basque lower nobility and free families of the Basque country and other regions continued to follow this custom, which persisted as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt;

An ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, is the historical consortium or [[coregency]] between husband, and wife or other relatives. The most notable of these are the Egyptian cases of [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], and the monarchs of the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]].

In 1980, [[Sweden]] amended its [[constitution]] to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s infant son, [[Prince Carl Philip]], in favor of his elder daughter, [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]], in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, [[Luxembourg]] in 2011, and the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realms]] in 2015.

[[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of [[kinship]] to the most recent monarch.

Recently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture:

* With the birth of [[Infanta Leonor of Spain]] on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe, Prince of Asturias]] and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Princess Letizia]], the Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'', making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent.
* In July 2006, the [[Nepal]]ese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=31256 |title=New Kerala}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.
* In 2011, the governments of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s which have a common monarch announced the [[Perth Agreement]], a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |title=Royal equality act will end succession of firstborn male –  rather than older sister |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/commonwealth-royalty-succession-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015.
* In [[Japan]], it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as [[Princess Aiko]] is the only child of [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]]. However, the birth in 2006 of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], a son of [[Prince Akishino]] (the younger brother of Crown Prince Naruhito, and next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne following Naruhito) has suspended the debate.

===Agnatic primogeniture===
Under agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who share agnatic kinship are termed "agnates"; those who share descent from a common ancestor through males and females or through females only are "cognates".

There were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to [[ultimogeniture]]) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession.

===Male-preference primogeniture===
Male-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a [[dynasty]] if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]]'s sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.

It was practiced in the succession to the once-separate thrones of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (until their union under [[James VI and I]]) and then the [[United Kingdom]] until 2015, when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all [[Commonwealth realm]]s that have the British monarch as their head of state.

Male-preference primogeniture is currently practiced in succession to the thrones of [[Monaco]]{{since when?|date=November 2018}} and [[Spain]] (before 1700 and since [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|1830]]).

With respect to [[hereditary title]]s, it is usually the rule for Scotland and [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|baronies by writ]] in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into [[abeyance]] when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder.

==Salic law==
An [[agnatic seniority]] primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the "[[Salic law]]" (see ''[[Terra salica]]''). This rule of succession developed in the course of a series of successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]], the only surviving child of [[Louis X of France]] was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]]. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]] (Charles IV's paternal cousin) became king, notwithstanding the claims of [[Edward III of England]]. By [[proximity of blood]], Edward was the closest relative to the dead king, as he was the son of the king's sister [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded.  This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent [[Hundred Years War]]. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century ''[[Salic law|Pactus Legis Salicae]]'', which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the French throne, as a governing rule for the French succession.

By the start of the 19th century, the royal houses of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ([[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]] and [[Bourbon-Parma|Parma]]) and [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]]), had adopted this system of exclusively male hereditary succession. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquests subsequently nudged the adoption of the law in [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] ([[House of Bernadotte|beginning in 1810]]) and in princely states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Other states adopted strict agnatic primogeniture as well, including [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] ([[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|beginning in 1853]]) and the new kingdoms of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. During this era, Spain (in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist conflicts]]) fought a [[civil war]] which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.

A variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of women to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947&amp;ndash;1978.

Most British and French titles of nobility descend to the senior male by primogeniture, to the exclusion of females, and agnatic [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] may bear [[courtesy titles|courtesy]] or [[subsidiary title|subsidiary]] titles.  Notable exceptions in England include the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is merged with the [[British Crown]] (which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century), and the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukedom of Marlborough]], which has included women in inheritance since its establishment in 1702.

==Semi-Salic law==
{{for|a clearer explanation of the differences between Salic, Semi-Salic laws and male-preference primogeniture|Salic law}}

Another variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or "agnatic-cognatic primogeniture", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebok, ''Tronföljd'', 1920; SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such were the cases of [[Bourbon Spain]] until 1833 and the dominions of [[Austria-Hungary]], as well as most realms within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of [[Russia]] under the [[Pauline Laws]] of 1797 and of [[Luxembourg]] until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.

There are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning [[consanguinity]] or [[proximity of blood]] the dynasty's [[house law]] defines who among female relatives is "nearest" to the last male.

===Uterine primogeniture===
Under ''uterine primogeniture'', succession to the throne or other property is passed to the male most closely related to the previous titleholder through female kinship.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; A male may also inherit a right of succession through a female ancestor or spouse, to the exclusion of any female relative who might be older or of nearer proximity of blood (see above for Spain's mid-twentieth century dynastic succession law). In such cases, inheritance depends on uterine kinship,&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; so a king would typically be succeeded by his sister's son. This particular system of inheritance applied to the thrones of the [[Picts]] of Northern Britain and the [[Etruscans]] of Italy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Some kingdoms and ethnic groups in [[Africa]] follow the same practice. This usage may stem in part from the certainty of the relationship to the previous king and kings: sons and daughters of a sister are his relations ([[mater semper certa est]]), even if they do not have the same father.

====Matrilineal primogeniture====
''Matrilineal primogeniture'', or ''female-preference uterine primogeniture'', is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] is an example in an [[Africa]]n culture of [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] primogeniture: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.

==History==
In Christian Europe, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. It forbade polygamy and taught that divorce was an impossibility ''per se'', as it still does. Consequently, in Europe, it was very difficult to ensure succession solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In [[Islam]]ic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned [[polygyny]], use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.

===Biblical===
{{Main|Bechor}}
[[File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving|''Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils'', a 1728 engraving by [[Gerard Hoet]].]]
The earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of [[Isaac]]'s sons [[Esau]], who was born first,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacob]], who was born second.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esau was entitled to the "birthright" (''bekhorah'' בְּכוֹרָה), but he sold the right to Jacob for a [[mess of pottage]], i. e. a small amount of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its widespread acceptance {{by whom|date=July 2017}} demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the [[Middle East]] for the account to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the [[Roman Empire]].

===Roman law===
During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman law]] governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died [[Intestacy|intestate]].&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Although admission to the two highest ''[[Roman Empire#ordines|ordines]]'' (orders), i. e. the [[Roman Senate|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]], potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Millar |year=1983 |title=Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status |url= |journal=[[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=73 |issue= |pages=87–88 |doi=10.2307/300073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ''ordines'' merely by hereditary succession or title to land.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Keith (2000). "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' ([[Oxford University Press]]), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the eldest son typically carried [[Roman naming conventions|his father's name]] in some form, he was expected to construct his own [[cursus honorum|career]] based on competence as an [[legatus|administrator or general]] and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' ("esteem") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as ''[[vir illustris]],'' that were not inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Millar. "Empire and City". p. 90, calls them "status-appellations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Roman emperor]]s indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined. The death of an emperor led to a critical period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Winterling, Aloys. ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, originally published 1988 in German). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, neither an emperor nor his heir had an inherent "right" to rule, and did so through military power and the Senate's symbolic consent.

===Reemergence in medieval and modern times===
The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in [[Medieval Europe]]; which due to the [[feudal system]] necessitated that the [[Fiefdom|estates]] of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families.&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu" /&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', explains the origin of primogeniture in Europe in the following way:

{{quote|[W]hen land was considered as the means, not of subsistence merely, but of power and protection, it was thought better that it should descend undivided to one. In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a sort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first institution.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Historical examples===
A case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law]] (attributed to the [[Salian Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1316|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of [[John I of France]], the short-lived son of deceased [[Louis X of France]] in favour of [[Philip V of France]] (brother of Louis and uncle of John) over [[Joan II of Navarre]] (daughter of Louis and sister of John), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Estates-General of 1317|fr|3=États généraux de 1317}} ruling that "''Women do not succeed the kingdom of France''". In 1328, it was further elaborated, with the statement that "''Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess''", to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1328|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of Philip V's brother [[Charles IV of France]] ([[Edward III of England]] or [[Philip VI of France]]), though the former would have a stronger claim should [[proximity of blood]] be considered, which had never been the case in France since 987, instead as well of both agnatic-cognatic primogeniture or male-preference cognatic primogeniture and the resulting heirs. This dispute was among the factors behind the [[Hundred Years' War]], which broke out in 1337.

Conflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in [[Spain]].

The crowns of [[Hanover]] and [[Great Britain]], which had been in [[personal union]] since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]: his niece [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]].

The divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the [[Nassau Family Pact|Nassau House Treaty of 1783]], which declared each prince of the [[House of Nassau]] to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)[[Nassau-Dietz]], which was given in exchange to [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]]. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-[[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke Adolf of Nassau]], who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the [[personal union]] of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Since the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.

Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title (''[[jure uxoris]]'').

In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood]] and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.
* The [[Philip I of Burgundy|Burgundian succession]] in 1361 was resolved in favor of [[John II of France|King John II]], son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of the elder daughter and son of [[Joan II of Navarre|Jeanne]]. John was only one generation of consanguinity removed from the late duke instead of two for Charles.
* In dispute over the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Scottish succession]], 1290–92, the [[Bruce]] family pleaded [[tanistry]] and [[proximity of blood]], whereas [[John of Scotland|Balliol]] argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, [[Edward I of England]], decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Independence Wars]] reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.
* The [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]] (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.

However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' (practically the same as [[Salic Law]]) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

Some countries, however, accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, in 1632 [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]].

In England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the [[Statute of Wills]] was passed in 1540, a will could control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant  [[by operation of law]]. The statute added a provision that a landowner could "devise" land by the use of a new device called a "testament". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the [[Administration of Estates Act]] in 1925.
In law, primogeniture is the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see [[knight]]). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England.

====United States and Canada====
In the United States, the colonies followed English primogeniture laws. Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts. The Americans differed little from English policies regarding the status of widow, widower, and lineal descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shammas |first1=Carole |year=1987 |title=English inheritance law and its transfer to the colonies |url= |journal=American Journal of Legal History |volume=31 |issue= |page=145 |doi=10.2307/845880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primogeniture laws were repealed at the time of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson took the lead in repealing the law in Virginia, where  nearly three-fourths of Tidewater land and perhaps a majority of western lands were entailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=Holly |year=1997 |title=Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia:" Ancient Feudal Restraints" and Revolutionary Reform |journal=William and Mary Quarterly |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=307–346 |jstor=2953276}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Canada had the same law but repealed it in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Hallowell, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2004), p 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] met at Placentia Bay in August 1941, FDR said he couldn’t understand the British aristocracy’s concept of primogeniture, and he intended to divide his estate equally between his five children; Churchill explained that an equal distribution was nicknamed the “Spanish Curse” by the British upper classes: ''“We give everything to the eldest and the others strive to duplicate it and found empires. While the oldest, having it all, marries for beauty. Which accounts, Mr President, for my good looks”''. But as Churchill’s father was a younger son, there may have been more modesty than mock-vanity than FDR realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = Andrew  | authorlink = Andrew Roberts (historian) | title = Masters and Commanders: The Military Geniuses who Led the West to Victory in World War II | publisher = Penguin | date = 2009 | location = London | page = 53 | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-141-02926-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noble titles==
===Spain===
In 2006, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] decreed a reform of the succession to noble titles from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref name="Spanish Nobility and Grandee Titles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |title=Nobility and Grandee Titles |work=Spanish Ministry of Justice |accessdate=May 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803062402/http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |archivedate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, the default custom of succession is absolute primogeniture, but the titleholder may designate his or her successor or distribute titles among children, provided that the eldest inherits the highest title unless he waives that right.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
 | The order of succession for all noble dignities is determined in accordance with the title of concession and, if there is none, with that traditionally applied in these cases. When the order of succession to the title is not specified in the nobility title creation charter, the following rules apply:
* Absolute preference is given to the direct descending line over the collateral and ascending line, and, within the same line, the closest degree takes precedence over the more remote and, within the same degree, the elder over the younger, combined with the principles of firstborn and representation.
* Men and women have an equal right of succession to [[grandee]]ship and to titles of nobility in [[Spain]], and no person may be given preference in the normal order of succession for reasons of gender.
}}

===United Kingdom===
Since 2013, there has been a revived movement to reform hereditary peerage inheritance law for equal primogeniture. The [[Equality (Titles) Bill]] and its successive legislation have been referred to as the "Downton law" in reference to the British television drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' where the Earl's eldest daughter is unable to inherit the family seat because it is [[Fee tail|entailed]] and can be passed only to a male heir.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Georgia|title=Ladies who could soon be a leaping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10540898/Ladies-who-could-soon-be-a-leaping.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Principles of [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]]''' otherwise known as '''''Uṣūl al-[[fiqh]]''''' ({{lang-ar|أصول الفقه}})  is the study and critical analysis of the origins, sources, and principles upon which Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') is based.

Traditionally four main sources ([[Qur’an]], [[Sunnah]], consensus (''[[Ijma]]''), analogical reason (''[[Qiyas]]'')) are analysed along with a number of secondary sources and principles.  

The main subject areas of discussion are these:
* General evidences and principles (''adillah ijmalliya wa al-qawaid'')
* Resolution of conflict and discrepancy (''ta'deel wa tarjeeh'')
* Determination of rules and adoption/emulation of rules (''ijtihad wa taqlid'')
* Islamic Law (''hukm shari'')

==Etymology==
''Uṣūl al-fiqh'' comprises the conjunction of two Arabic terms, ''uṣūl'' and ''fiqh''. ''Uṣūl'' is derived from the root letters [[hamza]], [[sad (letter)|sad]] and [[lām]] which refers to basis. ''Fiqh'' linguistically refers to knowledge, deep understanding or comprehension.

Technically the term is used to refer to the body of evidences and principles that Islamic jurists utilize to provide solutions to problems.

==Definition of the Science of Uşūl al-Fiqh==
The science of uşūl al-fiqh is a science in which such rules whose results are placed in ways of deduction of juristic precepts are discussed. For instance, performing the prayers (şalāt) is mandatory in Islam, and this Qur’ānic verse proves that obligation: “And that perform the prayers” (6, 72). However, denotation of the verse is dependent upon the imperative, like “perform” in that verse, being apparent in the obligation on the one hand and Qur’ānic apparent meanings being authoritative on the other. Those two issues are dealt with in the science of uşūl al-fiqh. Now, when the jurist learns through this science that the imperative is apparent in the obligation and that the Qur’ānic apparent meanings are authoritative proofs, he can infer from the said verse that the prayers is mandatory.&lt;ref name="Hodaee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hodaee|first1=Alireza|title=An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence: A Shiite Approach|url=http://ijtihadnet.com/introduction-methodology-islamic-jurisprudence-shiite-approachpdf/|website=http://ijtihadnet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qur'an]] has always been regarded as the primary legal source of Islam, the speech of [[Allah]]. It has been transmitted through numerous chains (''mutawatir''). According to Roy Mottahedeh, "For over a thousand years the great majority of Muslim jurists agreed" that of the more than 6000 verses in the Qur'an, 500 have some legal content, most concerning [[ibadah]] (worship or religious ritual such as [[salat]] (prayer), [[hajj]] (pilgrimage), [[sawm]] (fasting), [[zakat]] (tithing)).   190 Qur'anic verses deal with some "aspects of the law" other than ibadah, but of these aspects "only matters of inheritance are laid out in any detail". &lt;ref name="Mottahedeh-intro-2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mottahedeh|first1=Roy|title=Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence|date=2003|publisher=Oneworld Publications. |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elcQBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Principles+of+Islamic+jurisprudence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwionOylkLPaAhWqz4MKHeGwC6oQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Principles%20of%20Islamic%20jurisprudence&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 April 2018 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For elaboration of the [[Quran]] or for clarification of a matter that is not mentioned in the Quran, these verses are supplemented by further revelation termed [[sunnah]]. Sunnah comprises explanations from Muhammad in terms of his speech, actions and silences which have been historically compiled and verified through chains of narrations called [[hadith]]s. Sunnah is second in prioritisation to Quran.

The Muslim [[jurists]] have found that some revelation has been captured through collective agreements expressed after the death of Muhammad through consensus of his companions which were transmitted over the ages. These are compiled as instances of consensus of the companions (''[[ijma al-sahaba]]'').

Therefore, the Qur’ān and the Sunnah are the two main sources of Islamic Legal Theory. However, the majority of jurists are of the view that Islamic law is based on four sources. 
* Ijmā‘ (consensus). It took the jurists considerable time to prove through the texts of the Qur’ān and the Sunnah that ijmā‘ is a valid source of law, and any that ḥukm (ruling) based on it should be accorded the status of the ḥukm of Allah . 
* Qiyās (analogy) was also successfully used to deduce the law from the Qur’ān and the Sunnah. The law deduced by Qiyās and ijmā‘ are actually dependent on evidence from the two main sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kayadibi |first1=Saim|title=Principles of Islamic Law and the Methods of Interpretation of the Texts (Uṣūl al-Fiqh) |date=2017|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|isbn=978 967 0526 33 1|pages=94 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when these failed to provide the authority sought did jurists resort to interpretation ''[[ijtihad]]''.

In the very early days of Islam Muslim authorities tended to rely on their own opinions to establish their interpretation of what a prescribed law should be for any given situation not founded on the Qur'an, a practice known as ''[[ra'y]]''.

The jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]], however, preferred to rely solely on traditions from Muhammad and thereafter on the method known as ''[[qiyas]]'' ([[analogy]]) where interpretations were to be derived from comparisons with relative subjects dealt with in the Qur'an or the traditions.

It is now the scholarly consensus, amongst both orientalist and traditional scholarship, that the following is a myth: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Once Shafi'i's school of law was fully established together with the other schools founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Malik]], the "door" of ''ijtihad'' was closed and it was considered that ''ijma'' had been reached on all necessary points of law (though the schools differ in many matters to this day but mostly on minor points of interpretation). Accordingly, Islamic jurisprudence has changed little for centuries and is based fundamentally on the four sources mentioned above. There is much debate and critique as to whether closing the gates of ijtihad was acceptable and whether it contributed to the intellectual and civislisational decline of the Muslims."{{cn|date=February 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wael Hallaq is widely credited for decisively discrediting this myth in the western world, whereas others such as Qasim Zaman continue to show how the Ulema continued to actively engage in Ijtihad. However, there is a valid debate over the degree to which the Ulema remained active in such endeavours ever since colonialism and modernity intruded Muslim lands. In fact, faced with such drastic change, there are certain cases that do show the Ulema to be initially dismissive of sociopolitical realities and hence lagging in their response- Nevertheless, eventually finding legal stratagems to solve dilemmas. A case in point is the issue of women's divorce in the time of Ashraf Ali Thanvi.&lt;ref&gt;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/60731/1/fareehak_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Shi'a schools, they have continued with ''ijtihad'' to the present day. They however disputed the methodology of compilation of narrations of sunnah and also limited consensus of the companions to consensus of the family of Muhammad (''[[ijma]] [[ahl al-bayt]]'')

==The schools of thought==

The schools of [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them.  The [[Sunni]] schools (and where they are commonly found) are
*[[Hanbali]] ([[Saudi Arabia]] and parts of [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]])
*[[Hanafi]] ([[Turkey]], [[the Balkans]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[northwest China]] and [[Egypt]])
*[[Maliki]] ([[North Africa]], [[West Africa]], [[Sudan]] and several of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]])
*[[Shafi'i]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]], [[East Africa]], [[Yemen]], [[Somalia]] and southern parts of [[India]])
*[[Zahiri]] (minority communities in [[Morocco]] and [[Pakistan]])
*[[Qurtubi]] No longer exists
*[[Laythi]] No longer exists
*[[Awza'i]] No longer exists

The schools of [[Shia]] Islam comprise:
*[[Ja'fari]] ([[Iran]], [[Iraq]])
*[[Zaydi]]

The schools of [[Khawarij]] comprise:
*[[Ibadi]] ([[Oman]])

These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular [[hadith]]s they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason ([[qiyas]]) in deciding difficulties.

== Principles within Sunni Islam ==
{{fiqh}}
* That which is necessary to achieve an obligation is obligatory
* That which leads to haram is haram
* Lesser of the two evils
* The doubt does not remove the certainty

Islamic law within the Sunni understanding draws from numerous sources. The most basic two sources {{spaced ndash}} indeed, the defining characteristics of Sunni Islam {{spaced ndash}} are the [[Qur'an]], believed by Muslims to be the literal word of [[God in Islam|God]], and the [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]] including the statements and actions of [[Muhammad]] passed down through historically verifiable [[Hadith|reports]]. [[Ijma|consensus]] is also accepted by Sunni Muslims, though there is much differing over its exact definition. [[Qiyas|Analogical reason]] is typically referred to as a fourth primary source by later and modern Muslim authors, though its exact definition and even validity are not unchallenged.

Beyond the four main sources, other methods such as [[Istihsan|juristic discretion]], [[Istislah|public welfare]] and [[Urf|local custom]] are often considered, though discussions regarding how these sources are to be applied is ongoing.

===The contribution of al-Shafi'i===
[[Al-Shafi'i]] documented a systematized set of principles, developing a cohesive procedure for legal [[Ijtihad|derivation of verdicts]]. His approach contrasted with the [[Hanafite]] methodology that determined the sources from the sayings and rulings of the companions and successors.  Furthermore, he raised the [[Sunnah]] to a place of prominence and restricted its legal use.  According to Shafi'i, only practices directly passed down from [[Muhammad]] were valid, eliminating the legitimacy of practices of Muhammad's followers.  Prior to Shafi'i, legal reasoning included personal reasoning thus suffering from inconsistency.  Shafi'i is probably best known for writing [[Al-Risala (book)|Risala]], a prime example of applying logic and order to Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islambasics.com/view.php?bkID=166&amp;chapter=5 |title=Usul Al Fiqh After Al Imam Al Shafi'i| accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Risala is considered a seminal work in the field of principles, it has been noted that the term "usul" is neither found in the title of the book nor is it used as such within the text.&lt;ref name="Stewart, pg. 105"&gt;Stewart, pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of methods===
Between Shafi'i's Risala and the next attested works of usul is a gap of several hundred years. These later works were significantly different from Shafi'is book, likely due to the insertion of [[Mu'tazila|Mu'tazilite]] and [[Ash'ari]]te theology into works of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=devin102&gt;[[Devin J. Stewart]], "Muhammad b. Dawud al-Zahiri's Manual of Jurisprudence." Taken from Studies in Islamic Law and Society Volume 15: Studies in Islamic Legal Theory. Edited by [[Bernard G. Weiss]]. Pg. 102. [[Leiden]]: 2002. [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between Shafi'i's work and these later works {{spaced ndash}} in terms of both content and the large chronological gap between which they were all composed {{spaced ndash}} is so great that modern scholarship has questioned the status of Shafi'i as the founder of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wael Hallaq]], ''Was al-Shafi‘i the Master Architect of Islamic Jurisprudence?'', [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], 4 (November 1993), pg. 587-605.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Makdisi, ''Juridical Theology'', pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Topics which became staples of written work on the principles of jurisprudence, such as reason versus revelation and interfaith debates regarding abrogation after revelation in Islam versus Judaism, were not even discussed by Shafi'i.

Indeed, even the division of the sources of Sunni law into four {{spaced ndash}} Qur'an, [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]], [[Ijma|consensus]] and [[Qiyas|analogical reason]] {{spaced ndash}} was not present in Shafi'is books at all, despite Muslim scholarship generally attributing this division to him.&lt;ref&gt;"Does Shafi'i Have a Theory of 'Four Sources' of Law?, taken from the PhD dissertation of Joseph E. Lowry, ''The Legal-Theoretical Content of the Risala of Muhammad B. Idris al-Shafi'i'', [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Qadi al-Nu'man]], one of the earliest jurists to write about usul after Shafi'i did - perhaps during Shafi'is lifetime - was Abū 'Ubaid al-Qāsim b. Sallām, who actually considered the sources of law to consist of only three {{spaced ndash}} the Qur'an, the prophetic tradition, and consensus consisting of either scholarly consensus or consensus of the early generations.&lt;ref name="Stewart, pg. 105"/&gt; This division into four sources is most often attributed to later jurists upon whose work most Sunni jurisprudence has been modeled such as [[Al-Baqillani|Baqillani]] and [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq, A history of Islamic legal theories : an introduction to Sunnī uṣūl al-fiqh. Pg. 30-35. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite schools respectively. Thus, the four main sources often attributed to Shafi'i evolved into popular usage long after his death.

Additionally, the later scholars of the four mainstream Sunni schools of law all increased beyond four sources; while the four sources are the most widely accepted, other practices such as the [[Fatwa]]s of the first generation of Muslims and the application of [[pure reason]] are not universally accepted.

===Application of sources===
Even after this evolution, there are still some disputes among Sunni [[jurists]] regarding these four sources and their application. [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and in particular [[Dawud al-Zahiri]] rejected all forms of analogical reason in authentic narrations from them,&lt;ref name=ali280&gt;[[Chiragh Ali]], The Proposed Political, Legal and Social Reforms. Taken from Modernist Islam 1840-1940: A Sourcebook, pg. 280. Edited by [[Charles Kurzman]]. [[New York City]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mansoor&gt;Mansoor Moaddel, ''Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse'', pg. 32. [[Chicago]]: [[University of Chicago Press]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuben Levy]], ''Introduction to the Sociology of Islam'', pg. 237, 239 and 245. [[London]]: Williams and Norgate, 1931-1933.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the later [[Maliki]]tes and [[Hanbali]]tes {{spaced ndash}} and in some cases, even [[Zahiri]]tes {{spaced ndash}} gravitated toward the acceptance of varying levels of analogical reason already accepted by [[Shafi'i]]tes and [[Hanafi]]tes.&lt;ref name=mansoor/&gt; Malik and [[Abu Hanifa]] both accepted pure reason as a source of law; Ahmad and Shafi'i did not, and Shafi'i was especially hostile to [[Istihsan|juristic preference]] as implemented by Abu Hanifa, yet pure reason later found its way into all Sunni schools of law.

The question of consensus has evolved considerably. Abu Hanifa, Ahmad and Zahiri only accepted the consensus of the [[Sahaba|first generation]] of Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Muslehuddin, "Philosophy of Islamic Law and Orientalists," Kazi Publications, 1985, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farooq"&gt;Dr. Mohammad Omar Farooq, "The Doctrine of Ijma: Is there a consensus?," June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while Malik was willing to accept the consensus of the first generation in general or the consensus of later generations within the community of [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=mansoor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslehuddin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi'i insinuated that consensus was not practically possible to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Majid Khadduri]], Introduction to [[Al-Shafi'i]]'s [[Al-Risala (book)|al-Risala]], pg.33&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of all schools eventually followed the views of [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in expanding the definition of accepted consensus to include scholarly consensus and silent consensus as well.&lt;ref name="farooq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, pg. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles within Shia Islam==
In [[Shi'a]] legal theory, analogical reason isn't recognised as a source of law; pure reason is, however.&lt;ref&gt;Moaddel, pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'ites may differ in the exact application of principles depending on whether they follow the [[Ja'fari]], [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] or [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] subdivisions of Shi'ism.

===Ja'fari principles===

{{main article|Usul Fiqh in Ja'fari school}}
There are two interpretations of what constitutes sources of law among jurists of the Ja'fari school.

*According to the [[Akhbari]] view, the only sources of law are the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority [[Usuli]] view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for.  This process is known as [[ijtihad]], and the [['Aql|intellect]] is recognised as a source of law.  It differs from the Sunni [[qiyas]] in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

[[Javadi Amoli]] wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in [[Shiite]] law is the [[Quran]] itself, which interprets itself 
# The other source is the tradition of the "infallibles" (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of the Muhammad as well as according to the [[Quran]] itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasnim]] ([[tafsir]]), Vol 1, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (''usul 'amaliyyah'') concerning factual probability.  An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession.  Similarly Catholic moral theology distinguishes between "direct principles" and "reflex principles", the latter being the equivalent of [[Murtada al-Ansari]]'s ''usul 'amaliyyah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of ''usul al-fiqh'', and was developed by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (1706-1792) and Shaykh [[Murtada al-Ansari]] (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is the translation of [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]]'s ''Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul''.

====Parts of the Shiite Uşūl al-Fiqh ====
Discussions of this science are presented in various parts in the works of uşūl al-fiqh. However, the best division is presented by al-Muhaqqiq al-Isfahani (d. 1940) in his last course of teaching (as narrated by his great student Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar in his Uşūl al-Fiqh, p. 11) according to which all uşūlī topics are discussed in the four following parts: Discussions of “terms,” of “intellectual implications,” of “the authority,” and of “practical principles.”
Discussions of terms deal with denotations and appearances of terms from a general aspect, such as appearance of the imperative in the obligation, that of the prohibition in the unlawfulness, and the like.
Discussions of intellectual implications survey implications of precepts even though such precepts may not be inferred from terms, such as discussing truthfulness of mutual implication of intellectual judgments and juristic precepts, of obligation of something necessitating obligation of its preliminaries (known as “the problem of preliminary of the mandatory act”), of obligation of something necessitating unlawfulness of its opposite (known as “the problem of the opposite”), of possibility of conjunction of the command and the prohibition, and so on.
Discussions of the authority investigate whether some specific thing is juristically treated as a proof; for instance, whether report of a single transmitter, appearances, appearances of the Quran, Sunna, consensus, intellect, and the like are authoritative proofs.
Discussions of practical principles deal with what the jurist refers to when he cannot find a persuasive proof, such as the principle of clearance from obligation, that of precaution, and so forth.
For more on this science, see [http://bayanbox.ir/download/7200445922802143481/Usul-Al-Fiqh.rar An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence(A Shiite Approach)]

===Ismaili principles===
Most early Ismaili works within the field of the principles of jurisprudence were actually responses to Sunni works on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qadi al-Nu'man]]'s ''Differences Among the Schools of Law'' is most likely the first of such written responses.

:''See [[Rogation days]] for usage pertaining to the Christian calendar of the Western Church.''

In [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutional law]], '''''rogatio''''' is the term (from [[Latin]]  ''rogo'', "ask, place a question before") for a [[Bill (proposed law)|legislative bill]] placed before an [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|Assembly of the People]] in ancient Rome. The ''rogatio'' procedure underscores the fact that the [[Roman senate]] could issue decrees, but was not a legislative or [[parliament]]arian body. Only [[SPQR|the People]] could pass legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], ''The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic'' (University of Michigan Press, 1998), pp. 157–158 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YVBNzYQy5vYC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=%22it+was+only+by+the+people+that+legislation+could+be+passed%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20was%20only%20by%20the%20people%20that%20legislation%20could%20be%20passed%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] with the right to summon the assembly could propose a bill (''rogatio legis''); the proposed laws themselves were ''leges rogatae''. A bill's proposer was its ''lator''; a supporter was an ''auctor''.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''The Crowd in Rome'' p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions in the senate would contribute to the drafting of a bill, which would be published (''promulgare rogationem'', that is, ''[[promulgation|promulgatio]]'') three weeks or more before it was formally submitted to the assembly. During this period, citizens could discuss the bill and propose changes, or more rarely ask for its withdrawal, at informal sessions (''contiones''). After the bill had been brought before the assembly for the vote, it could no longer be modified.&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 182 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislator who introduced the bill asked ''Velitis iubeatis, Quirites?'' ("Citizens, are you going to approve and order?"&lt;ref&gt;Or, "Citizens, is it your will that you should order it?"&lt;/ref&gt;) and the people responded [[yea or nay]] without discussion. If a bill was withdrawn after the ''rogatio'' but before the vote was taken, it was usually because a [[tribune]] threatened to use his veto power against it, or less frequently because it proved unpopular among the ''[[plebs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''Judicial reform and land reform in the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 6–7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=rogatio+OR+rogation+inauthor:Lintott&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio%20OR%20rogation%20inauthor%3ALintott&amp;f=false online.] Lintott believes [[Cicero]] exaggerates the extent to which the ''plebs'' could influence withdrawal.&lt;/ref&gt; If a bill was passed (''rogatio lata est''), it became a law (''[[Roman law|lex]]'') after the presiding magistrate made a formal announcement (''renuntiatio'') of the assembly's decision.

In the Early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the senate had to approve the constitutionality of a law before it was enacted; after the passage of the ''[[Conflict of the Orders#The end of the Conflict of the Orders (367-287 BC)|Lex Publilia Philonis]]'' in 339 BC, which required that at least one of the two ''[[Roman censor|censores]]'' be a plebeian, this approval (''patrum [[auctoritas]]'') was required before the bill was put to a vote in the assembly. With controversial [[populares|popularist]] measures, however, the senate was sometimes bypassed. 
If a bill was proposed for the purpose of declaring war, it had to be brought before the [[Centuriate Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, ''Rome, the Greek World, and the East'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill that became law was inscribed on copper or marble tablets and kept in the state treasury (''[[aerarium]] populi romani'') under the supervision of the [[quaestor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63 BC, [[Cicero]] managed to [[Obstructionism|obstruct]] a ''rogatio Servilia'' by making a speech before the people; this appears to be the only time in the Late Republic when oratory blocked a popular piece of legislation, which in this case had provided for the distribution of land to the poor. Or so Cicero claims; the bill's sponsor, the tribune [[Servilius Rullus]], more likely withdrew it because of the threat of veto from one of his fellow tribunes, and it never reached the ''[[comitia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Mouritsen, ''Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 54–55 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8iQQ7Xe2y-wC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.] Further discussion of the ''rogatio Servilia'' by [[Erich S.

The '''sociology of law''' (or '''legal sociology''') is often described as a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] or an interdisciplinary approach within [[jurisprudence|legal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For various definitions of the sociology of law,see Ehrlich 1936 (orig 1912); Timasheff 1939; Pound 1943; Selznick 1965, Aubert 1969 and 1980, Black 1972, Stjernquist 1983, Hydén 1986, Tomasic 1987, Ferrari 1989, Podgorecki 1991, Cotterrell 1992, Banakar 2003 and 2011; Mathiesen 2005, Deflem 2008, Travers 2009, Nelken 2009, Scuro 2010, Banakar and Travers 2013, Banakar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see sociology of law as belonging "necessarily" to the field of sociology,&lt;ref&gt;See Deflem 2008:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others tend to consider it a field of research caught up between the disciplines of [[law]] and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003 and 2009, Banakar and Travers 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others regard it neither a subdiscipline of sociology nor a branch of legal studies but as a field of research on its own right within the broader social science tradition. Accordingly, it may be described without reference to mainstream sociology as "the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as a set of social practices or as an aspect or field of social experience".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as treating law and justice as fundamental institutions of the basic structure of society mediating "between political and economic interests, between culture and the normative order of society, establishing and maintaining interdependence, and constituting themselves as sources of consensus, coercion and social control".&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrespective of whether sociology of law is defined as a sub-discipline of sociology, an approach within legal studies or a field of research in its own right, it remains intellectually dependent mainly on the traditions, methods and theories of mainstream [[sociology]] and, to a lesser extent, on other [[social sciences]] such as [[social anthropology]], [[political science]], [[social policy]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. As such, it reflects social theories and employs social scientific methods to study [[law]], [[legal institutions]] and legal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Travers 2005, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, sociology of law consists of various approaches to the study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976; Cotterrell 1992; Hunt 1993; Santos 2002; Banakar 2003; Banakar and Travers 2002; Ferrari 1989; Luhmann 1985; Trevino 2008; Travers 2009, Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of legal institutions, forms of [[social control]], legal [[regulation]], the interaction between [[legal culture]]s, the social construction of legal issues, [[legal profession]] and the relation between law and [[social change]].

Sociology of law also benefits from and occasionally draws on research conducted within other fields such as [[comparative law]], [[critical legal studies]], [[jurisprudence]], [[legal theory]], [[law and economics]] and [[law and literature]]. Its object encompasses the historical movement of law and justice and their relentless contemporary construction such as in the field of jurisprudence focused on institutional questions conditioned by social and political situations, in interdisciplinary dominions such as criminology and through analysis of the economic efficiency and the social impact of legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual origins==
[[File:Veber.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Max Weber]]]]
The roots of the sociology of law can be traced back to the works of sociologists and jurists of the turn of the previous century. The relationship between law and society was sociologically explored in the seminal works of both [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]]. The writings on law by these classical sociologists are foundational to the entire sociology of law today.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other scholars, mainly jurists, also employed social scientific theories and methods in an attempt to develop sociological theories of law. Notably among these were [[Leon Petrazycki]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]].

For [[Max Weber]], a so-called "legal rational form" as a type of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a [[rational-legal authority]]. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on Weber's typology see Kronman 1983: 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with [[restitution]] and [[damages|compensation]] grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies in which there is a high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of [[Durkheim|Durkheim's]] sociology of law see Cotterrell 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law'', [[Eugen Ehrlich]] developed a sociological approach to the study of law by focusing on how social networks and groups organized social life.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich 1936 (orig. 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the relationship between law and general social norms and distinguished between "positive law," consisting of the compulsive norms of state requiring official enforcement, and "living law," consisting of the rules of conduct that people in fact obeyed and which dominated social life. The latter emerged spontaneously as people interacted with each other to form social associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegert 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The centre of gravity of legal development therefore from time immemorial has not lain in the activity of the state, but in society itself, and must be sought there at the present time".|Eugen Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, 1936: 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was subjected to criticism by the advocates of legal positivism such as the jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] for its distinction between "law created by the state and law produced by the organisational imperatives of non-state social associations".&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelsen, Ehrlich had confused ''Sein'' ("is") and ''Sollen'' ("ought").&lt;ref&gt;For a presentation of this debate and references to the original sources of the debate see van Klink 2006. For an analysis of the debate between Kelsen and Ehrlich see Banakar 2008. Banakar argues that Kelsen could not help but miss the point that Ehrlich was making by his distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109&lt;br&gt;* Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Leon Petrazycki]]]]
[[Leon Petrazycki]] distinguished between forms of "official law," supported by the state, and "intuitive law," consisting of legal experiences that, in turn, consist of a complex of psychic processes in the mind of the individual with no reference to outside authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrazycki1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrazycki's work addressed sociological problems and his method was empirical, since he maintained that one could gain knowledge of objects or relationships only by observation. However, he couched his theory in the language of cognitive psychology and moral philosophy rather than sociology. Consequently, his contribution to the development of sociology of law remains largely unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2006; also see Podgórecki 1980; Kurczewski 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Petrazycki's "intuitive law" influenced not only the development of Georges Gurvitch's concept of "social law" (see below), which in turn has left its mark on socio-legal theorising, but also the work of later socio-legal scholars. Among those who were directly inspired by Petrazycki's work is the Polish legal sociologist [[Adam Podgórecki]].&lt;ref&gt;See Podgórecki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Geiger]] developed a close-knit analysis of the Marxist theory of law. He highlighted how law becomes a "factor in social transformation in democratic societies of the kind that are governed by the consent expressed by universal suffrage of the population practised at regular intervals".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger went on to develop the salient characteristics of his antimetaphysical thinking, until he exceeded it with practical [[nihilism]]. Geiger's nihilism of values paved the way for a form of [[legal nihilism]], which encourages the construction of a sober democracy "that is capable of raising conflict to the intellectual level and of anaesthetising feelings, as it is aware of its own inability to make any proclamation of value, ethics or policy about the nature of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Gurvitch]] was interested in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction. His aim was to devise the concept of "social law" as a law of integration and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;see Gurvitch, Georges, ''L'idée du droit social'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Gurvitch's social law was an integral part of his general sociology. "It is also one of the early sociological contributions to the theory of legal pluralism, since it challenged all conceptions of law based on a single source of legal, political, or moral authority".&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the sociology of law had an early reception in Argentina. As a local movement of legal scholars steeming from the work of Carlos Cossio, South American researchers have focused on comparative law and sociological insights, constitutional law and society, human rights, and psycho-social approaches to the legal practices.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Lista, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological approaches to the study of law==

===Modern sociology of law===
The sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the emergence of the "sociological movement" in law after World War II see Deflem 2009: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of [[Talcott Parsons]], for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Cotterrell 1992: 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as [[Philip Selznick]], argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Selznik, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]], developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of [[pure sociology]]. Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the [[autopoietic system]]s theory of the German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]], who presents law or "the legal system" as one of the ten ''function systems'' (see [[Differentiation (sociology)|functional differentiation]]) of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Luhmann 2004 and 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth and Schutz 2015"&gt;[[Steffen Roth]] and Anton Schutz: ''Ten systems. Toward a canon of function systems.'' In: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing'', Vol. 22, No. 4., 2015. Vorversion verfügbar (englisch; [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508950 online] auf ssrn.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|All collective human life is directly or indirectly shaped by law. Law is like knowledge, an essential and all-pervasive fact of the social condition.|Niklas Luhmann, ''A Sociological Theory of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, 1985: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] disagrees with Luhmann and argues that the law can do a better job as a 'system' institution' by representing more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional ''habitus'' of the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his associates (often influenced by [[Petrazycki]]'s ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by [[Per Stjernquist]], and in Norway by [[Vilhelm Aubert]].

In more recent years, a very wide range of theories has emerged in the sociology of law as a result of the proliferation of theories in sociology at large. Among the recent influences can be mentioned the work of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]], [[neo-Marxism]], and [[behaviorism]]. The variety of theoretical influences in the sociology of law has also marked the broader law and society field. The multi-disciplinary law and society field remains very popular, while the disciplinary speciality field of the sociology of law is also "better organized than ever in institutional and professional respects".&lt;ref&gt;Deflem 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Society===
Law and Society is an American movement, which was established after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had a vested interest in the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by [[Lawrence Friedman]]: "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986:780.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders believed that the "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods".&lt;ref&gt;Austin et al, 1998:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Law and Society Association]] in 1964 and of the ''Law and Society Review'' in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.&lt;ref&gt;See Munger 1998 and Simon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one view, the main difference between the sociology of law and Law and Society is that the latter does not limit itself theoretically or methodologically to sociology and tries instead to accommodate insights from all social science disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an example see Friedman 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; "Not only does it provides a home for sociologists and social anthropologists and political scientists with an interest in law, it also tries to incorporate psychologists and economists who study law."&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From another point of view, both sociology of law and Law and Society should be seen as multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary enterprises although sociology of law has special ties to the methods, theories and traditions of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s a number of original empirical studies were conducted by Law and Society scholars on conflict and dispute resolution. In his early work, [[Bill Felstiner|William Felstiner]], for example, focused on alternative ways to solve conflicts (avoidance, mediation, litigation etc.). Together with [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]] and [[Austin Sarat]], Felstiner developed the idea of a disputes pyramid and the formula "naming, blaming, claiming", which refers to different stages of conflict resolution and levels of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;"See, Felstiner, Abel and Sarat 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological jurisprudence===
The sociology of law is often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some of the debates within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faigman|first=David L.|title=Laboratory of Justice: The Supreme Court's 200-Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Henry Holt |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Roscoe. "Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence." ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 24 (1910): 591. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid E. Rumble, Jr., "Legal Realism, Sociological Jurisprudence and Mr. Justice Holmes," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1965) 26#4 pp. 547-566 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708499 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and the Russian-French sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinguishing between different branches of the social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse the development of the sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful for the development of the field as whole. For the social scientific studies of law to transcend the theoretical and empirical limits, which currently define their scope, they need to go beyond such artificial distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-legal studies==
'Socio-legal studies' in the UK has grown mainly out of the interest of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a methodological approach, it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not, therefore, be confused with the legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services'&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that it "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001: 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include [[Carol Smart|Professor Carol Smart]], co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building#External links|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]], (named after the sociologist, [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]]), as well as [[Mavis Maclean|Professor Mavis Maclean]] and [[John Eekelaar]] who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP).

'''Socio-legal methods of investigation'''

The sociology of law has no methods of investigation which have been developed specifically for conducting socio-legal research. Instead, it employs a wide variety of social scientific methods, including qualitative and quantitative research techniques, to explore law and legal phenomena. Positivistic&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interpretive (such as discourse analysis) and ethnographic&lt;ref&gt;See Travers 1997, Flood 2005 and 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; approaches to data collection and analysis is used within the socio-legal field.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of various methods see Banakar and Travers 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of law in Britain==
Sociology of law was a small, but developing, sub-field of British sociology and legal scholarship at the time when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.

'''Symbolic interactionism and Marxism'''

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionism]] had become popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a politically radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing society as a system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Becker 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused on the process of law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paterson 1982; Flood 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential sociological approach during this period was, however, Marxism—which claimed to offer a scientific and comprehensive understanding of society as a whole in the same way as structural-functionalism, although with the emphasis on the struggle between different groups for material advantage, rather than value-consensus. This approach caught the imagination of many people with left-wing political views in law schools, but it also generated some interesting empirical studies. These included historical studies about how particular
statutes were used to advance the interests of dominant economic groups, and also Pat Carlen's memorable ethnography,&lt;ref&gt;Pat Carlen 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined analytic resources from Marxism and interactionism, especially the sociology of Erving Goffman, in writing about magistrates' courts.

'''The Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies'''

The 1980s were also a fruitful time for empirical sociology of law in Britain, mainly
because Donald Harris deliberately set out to create the conditions for a fruitful
exchange between lawyers and sociologists at the [[University of Oxford]] Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was fortunate enough to recruit a number of young and
talented social scientists, including J. Maxwell Atkinson and Robert Dingwall who were interested in ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociology
of the professions, and Doreen McBarnet who became something of a cult figure on the left after publishing her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Doreen McBarnet 1981&lt;/ref&gt; which advanced a particularly clear and vigorous Marxist analysis of the criminal justice system. Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches have a lot in common when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a sociologist at the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Drew, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest developed at Oxford during this period was the sociology of the professions. Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; edited what remains an interesting and theoretically diverse collection, bringing together specialists from the sociology of law and medicine. The best known study to date has, however, been published by the American scholar [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;Abel 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who employed ideas and concepts from functionalist, Marxist, and Weberian
sociology to explain the high incomes and status that British lawyers enjoyed for most of the twentieth century.

'''Recent developments'''

Since the 1980s, relatively few empirical studies of law and legal institutions have been conducted by British sociologists, i.e. studies which are empirical and at the same time engage with the theoretical concerns of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some exceptions. To begin with, sociology of law, along with so many areas of academic work, has been enlivened and renewed through engagement with feminism. There has been a great deal of
interest in the implications of Foucault's ideas on governmentality for understanding
law,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Wickham 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and also in continental thinkers such as Niklas Luhmann and Pierre Bourdieu. Again, one can argue that rather fewer empirical studies have been produced than one might have hoped, but a great deal of interesting work has been published.

A second exception is to be found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1997; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.

Despite the relatively limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law have been important in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from [[David Nelken]] exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and the potential of the idea of legal cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2004; 2007; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cotterrell]] seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars, such as [[David Schiff]] and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory and the extent to which law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social.&lt;ref&gt;Nobles and Schiff 2006; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.

==Devising a sociological concept of law==
In contrast to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on [[law]]), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The rule-based aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009; Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, legal sociology regards law as a set of institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar and Travers 2005 and Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example [[Eugen Ehrlich]]'s concept of "living law" and [[Georges Gurvitch]]'s "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of legal pluralism see Dalberg-Larsen 2000; Merry 1988; Chiba 1989; John Griffiths 1986; Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western sociology of law==

The interest in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Deva, 2005; Baxi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but we find only a limited amount of socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier overview of the field, see Ferrari, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the disparity between Western and non-Western sociology of law see Banakar 2011 at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary perspectives==

===Legal pluralism===
[[Legal pluralism]] is a concept developed by legal sociologists and social anthropologists "to describe multiple layers of law, usually with different sources of legitimacy, that exist within a single state or society".&lt;ref&gt;Olgiati 2007; also see Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also defined "as a situation in which two or more legal systems coexist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Engle Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralists define law broadly to include not only the system of courts and judges backed by the coercive power of the state, but also the "non-legal forms of normative ordering".&lt;ref&gt;Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralism consists of many different methodological approaches and as a concept, it embraces "diverse and often contested perspectives on law, ranging from the recognition of different legal orders within the nation-state, to a more far reaching and open-ended concept of law that does not necessarily depend on state recognition for validity. This latter concept of law may come into being whenever two or more legal systems exist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The ideology of legal positivism has had such a powerful hold on the imagination of lawyers and social scientists that its picture of the legal world has been able successfully to masquerade as fact and has formed the foundation stone of social and legal theory.|John Griffiths, "What is Legal Pluralism"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, 1986:5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal pluralism has occupied a central position in socio-legal theorising from the very beginning of the sociology of law. The sociological theories of [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]] were early sociological contributions to legal pluralism. It has, moreover, provided the most enduring topic of socio-legal debate over many decades within both the sociology of law and legal anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and has received more than its share of criticism from the proponents of the various schools of [[legal positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Tamanaha 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics often ask: "How is law distinguished in a pluralist view from other normative systems? What makes a social rule system legal?".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy arises mainly "from the claim that the only true law is the law made and enforced by the modern state".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This standpoint is also known as "legal centralism". From a legal centralist standpoint, John Griffiths writes, "law is and should be the law of the state, uniform for all persons, exclusive of all other law, and administrated by a single set of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to legal centralism, "customary laws and religious laws are not properly called 'law' except in so far as state has chosen to adopt and treat any such normative order as part of its own law".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between the "weak" and the "strong" versions of legal pluralism. The "weak" version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of "legal centralism", but only recognises that within the domain of the Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths, 2002: 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "weak" version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…".&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha 1993: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong" version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion,"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter 1981: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism directed at legal pluralism often uses the basic assumptions of legal positivism to question the validity of theories of legal pluralism which aim at criticising those very (positivistic) assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roger Cotterrell]] explains, the pluralist conception should be understood as part of "the legal sociologist's effort to broaden perspectives on law. A legal sociologist's specification of law might be different from that presupposed by a lawyer in practice, but it will relate (indeed, in some way incorporate) the latter because it must (if it is to reflect legal experience) take account of lawyers' perspectives on law. Thus a pluralist approach in legal theory is likely to recognise what lawyers typically recognize as law, but may see this law as one species of a larger genus, or treat lawyers' conception of law as reflecting particular perspectives determined by particular objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopoiesis===
[[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] originally coined the concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by [[Niklas Luhmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ziegert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising a solution to the problem of the humanised 'subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most challenging idea incorporated in the theory of autopoiesis is that social systems should not be defined in terms of human agency or norms, but of communications. Communication is in turn the unity of utterance, information and understanding and constitutes social systems by recursively reproducing communication. This sociologically radical thesis, which raises the fear of a dehumanised theory of law and society, attempts to highlight the fact that social systems are constituted by communicative."&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Max Travers 2005: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Cotterrell]], "Luhmann... treats the theory as the basis for all general sociological analysis of social systems and their mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret whatever this research may discover."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cultures===
[[Legal culture]] is one of the central concepts of the sociology of law. The study of legal cultures may, at the same time, be regarded as one of the general approaches within the sociology of law.

As a concept, it refers to "relatively stable patterns of legally-oriented social behaviour and attitudes," and as such is regarded as a subcategory of the concept of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelken, 2004: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new concept which, according to [[David Nelken]], can be traced to "terms like legal tradition or legal style, which have a much longer history in comparative law or in early political science. It presupposes and invites us to explore the existence of systematic variations in patterns in 'law in the books' and 'law in action,' and, above all, in the relation between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an approach, it focuses on the cultural aspects of law, legal behaviour and legal institutions and, thus, has affinity with [[cultural anthropology]], legal pluralism, and [[comparative law]].

[[Lawrence M. Friedman]] is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 193. But for criticism of the vagueness of this and other formulations of the concept of legal culture in sociology of law, see Cotterrell, 2006, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.

===Feminism===
Law has always been regarded as one of the important sites of engagement for feminism. As pointed out by Ruth Fletcher feminist engagement with the law has taken many forms through the years, which also indicates their successful merging of theory and practice: "Through litigation, campaigns for reform and legal education, feminists have engaged explicitly with law and the legal profession. In taking on the provisions of specialist advice services, women's groups have played a role in making law accessible to those in need. By subjecting legal concepts and methods to critical analysis, feminists have questioned the terms of legal debate."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Globalization]] is often defined in terms of economic processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth&lt;ref&gt;Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkmar Gessner&lt;ref&gt;Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the relatively early empirical studies see Dezalay and Garth 1996. For a collection of empirical studies of law and globalization see Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pointed out by Halliday and Osinsky, "[[Economic globalization]] cannot be understood apart from global business regulation and the legal construction of the markets on which it increasingly depends. Cultural globalization cannot be explained without attention to intellectual property rights institutionalized in law and global governance regimes. The globalization of protections for vulnerable populations cannot be comprehended without tracing the impact of international criminal and humanitarian law or international tribunals. Global contestation over the institutions of democracy and state building cannot be meaningful unless considered in relation to constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday and Osinsk 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socio-legal approaches to the study of globalization and global society often overlap with, or make use of, studies of legal cultures and legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;See Teubner 1996; Feest and Nelken 2007, Friedman and Perez-Perdomo 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State v. Stone''' is a popular [[Mock Trial|mock trial]] case published by the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]].  Set in the fictional town of "Nita City", the case is about a man named James Stone who is charged with the [[rape]] of a 21-year-old college student named Marilyn Miller.

== Facts of the Case ==

On a December afternoon in Nita City, the police receive a call from a 21-year-old college student named Marilyn Miller, who explains that a man broke into her apartment and raped her.  Miller is taken in for medical treatment, which confirms forcible rape, and on the ride back to her apartment she tells the police officer that she remembers seeing her attacker before.  Miller explains that the previous night, she was at a bar called "Rocco's" where she had an encounter with a twenty-something male who grabbed her hand and said "you need some loving."  She tells the officer that this man was the one who attacked her.

Police find a small blue book in Marilyn Miller's apartment, which they trace to a 28-year-old man with a criminal record named James Stone.  The book was a notebook used and carried around by Stone.  Stone is subsequently arrested; at his residence, police find clothing matching Miller's description of what the attacker wore.  The police show Miss Miller a series of photographs, one of which is Stone's, asking if she can identify her attacker.  Miller states that she thinks the photograph of Stone is her attacker, but wants to see him in person to be sure.  A police officer then takes her to James Stone's arraignment, where he is escorted before the judge in the courtroom.  Upon seeing James Stone, Marilyn Miller confirms that he was the one who attacked her.

James Stone admits that he was the one said "you need some loving" to Marilyn Miller at Rocco's the previous night, but he denies that he raped her, and insists that he lost his blue book at the bar.  James Stone's friends, Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsay, testify for him as alibi witnesses, saying that they were with Stone at the Nita University cafeteria around the time the attack took place.  James Stone also insists that he is happily married, though some evidence suggests that he was unhappy in his relationship with his wife...and that he had a rather strong sexual desire.

=== Important facts tending to incriminate James Stone ===

* Marilyn Miller identified Stone as her attacker.
* Stone's blue notebook was found at Miller's apartment.
* Stone had clothing matching the description of the attacker given by Miller, including a red bandana that Miller said her attacker wore over his face.
* Stone has a criminal record.

=== Common defenses to these ===

* Marilyn Miller didn't identify Stone as her attacker until the ride back to her apartment, which was after she had been given medication.
* Stone claims he lost the blue book at Rocco's and that she must have taken it home with her.  A waitress from Rocco's testifies that she saw James Stone and his friends searching for something at the end of the night.  However, they never told her at the time what they were searching for.
* The clothing worn by the attacker was not particularly uncommon for a person to have.
* Stone's past criminal record involves a burglary and an incident where he drove the getaway car in an armed robbery; nothing on the order of rape.

== Witnesses ==

There are a total of ten witness characters in the case.

=== Witnesses for the State ===

'''Marilyn Miller.'''  The woman who accuses James Stone of raping her.

'''Detective Wasilewski.'''  The detective who led the investigation of the rape.

'''Dr. Madden.'''  The OB/GYN who treated Marilyn Miller.

'''Diana Samuels.'''  A woman with whom James Stone was having an affair.  Her note to her therapist suggests that Stone had very strong sexual urges.

'''Officer Pace.'''  The police officer who responded to the rape call.

=== Witnesses for the Defense ===

'''James Stone.'''  The defendant.

'''Florence Stone.'''  James Stone's wife, who defends his good and moral character.

'''Edward Lindsey.'''  A friend of Stones, who claims he was with him around the time of the rape.

'''Thomas Mitchell.'''  Another friend of stones who also claims to have been with him around the time of the rape.

'''Esther Boothe.'''  A waitress who testifies that she saw James Stone and his friends searching for something before they left Rocco's on the night before the rape.

== Aspects of the Case ==

Like most cases designed for mock trials, ''State v. Stone'' has many nuances.

=== Character of James Stone ===

James Stone is designed to be a "scum of the earth" type of character, a man with a multiple felony convictions who is cheating on his wife, and who would accost a young girl in a bar and tell her "you need some loving."  Indeed, his very name "Stone" seems to be something of a character pun, much like his counterpart "John Diamond", the umblemished police officer and former Marine who is the defendant in the NITA case ''State v. Diamond.''  An important part of the defense's case is the rehabilitation of Stone's character, or alternatively, keeping this out of the case.

=== The Blue Book ===

There is no dispute that the blue notebook belonging to James Stone was found inside Marilyn Miller's apartment.  According to the prosecution's theory of the case, Stone accidentally dropped it there when he raped Miller.

The defense is thus shouldered with offering an alternate explanation for how the book ended up in Miller's apartment.  A popular argument is that she somehow accidentally took it home with her from Rocco's the previous night; perhaps it was dropped in her purse when Stone accosted her, or that she took it back thinking it was hers, and forgot after being given medication after her rape.

=== Marilyn Miller's Apartment ===

An important hole for the prosecution to fill is how James Stone found Marilyn Miller's apartment.  Miller lived in a multiple-dwelling residence, with doors leading to two different apartments inside of a main door (one upstairs, one downstairs).  Miller testified that she heard a crash and that the next thing she knew, her rapist was standing in the doorway.  Her rapist thus must have known which apartment inside the building was hers.

One theory might be that James Stone followed Miller home, and after she entered her apartment building, saw her turn on the light  through the window - indicating that Marilyn lived in the upstairs apartment in the building.

=== Witness Credibility versus Alibi Strength ===

Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsey both testify that they were with James Stone at a cafeteria around noon on the day of the rape.  The victim call and reported the rape at 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., meaning that Mitchell's testimony still leaves time, albeit not much, for James Stone to have potentially committed the rape.

Both sides have something of a dilemma with Mitchell and Lindsey because, on one hand, if their testimony still leaves room for Stone to commit the crime, then this makes their testimony more reliable.  If Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsey were lying to protect Stone and give him an alibi, then logically, they would alibi him for the entire time period.  The fact that their testimony doesn't completely exonerate Stone suggests that Mitchell and Lindsey are telling the truth.  On the other hand, if their alibi is imperfect, then it still leaves room for the crime to be committed.

Both sides should ideally argue for their version of the facts under both potential sets of facts.  In other words, the prosecution should ideally argue that, either Mitchell and Lindsey are being untruthful - meaning that their testimony doesn't exonerate Stone - or that they are being truthful, but the alibi they present is imperfect.

=== DNA Evidence ===

''State v. Stone'' was written before [[DNA]] was widely used as evidence, and there is no discussion of any attempt to recover genetic material from the victim in the original publication.  Some courses and competitions may add the fact that no material containing DNA was discovered or that the case should be considered as though genetic testing has not yet been developed.

'''Trial by ordeal''' was an ancient judicial practice by which the guilt or innocence of the accused was determined by subjecting them to a painful, or at least an unpleasant, usually dangerous experience. The test was one of life or death, and the proof of innocence was survival. In some cases, the accused was considered innocent if they escaped injury or if their injuries healed.

In [[medieval Europe]], like [[trial by combat]], trial by ordeal was considered a "judgement of God" ({{lang-la|judicium Dei}}): a procedure based on the premise that [[God]] would help the innocent by performing a miracle on his behalf. The practice has much earlier roots, attested to as far back as the [[Code of Hammurabi]] and the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]].

In pre-modern society, the ordeal typically ranked along with the [[oath]] and [[witness]] accounts as the central means by which to reach a judicial verdict. Indeed, the term ''ordeal'', [[Old English]] ''ordǣl'', has the meaning of "judgment, verdict" (German ''Urteil'', Dutch ''oordeel''), from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*uzdailjam'' "that which is dealt out".

Priestly cooperation in trials by fire and water was forbidden by [[Pope Innocent III]] at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215 and replaced by [[compurgation]]. Trials by ordeal became rarer over the [[Late Middle Ages]], but the practice was not discontinued until the 16th century. Certain trials by ordeal would continue to be used into the 17th century in [[witch-hunt]]s.&lt;ref name="CathEnc" /&gt;

==Types of ordeals==

===By combat===
{{main|Trial by combat}}
Ordeal by combat took place between two people in a dispute. They, or, under certain conditions, a designated "champion" acting on their behalf, would fight, and the loser of the fight or the party represented by the losing champion was deemed guilty or liable.

A notable case was that of [[Gero, Count of Alsleben]], whose daughter married [[Siegfried II, Count of Stade]].

===By fire===
[[File:Ordeal by red-hot iron.jpg|thumb|200px|After being accused of adultery [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] proved her innocence by walking over red-hot [[ploughshare]]s.]]
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}Ordeal by fire was one form of torture. Ordeal of fire typically required that the accused walk a certain distance, usually {{convert|9|ft|abbr=off}} or a certain number of paces, usually three, over [[Incandescence|red-hot]] [[ploughshare]]s or holding a red-hot [[iron]]. Innocence was sometimes established by a complete lack of injury, but it was more common for the wound to be bandaged and re-examined three days later by a priest, who would pronounce that God had intervened to heal it, or that it was merely festering&amp;mdash;in which case the suspect would be [[exile]]d or put to death. One famous story about the ordeal of ploughshares concerns [[Edward the Confessor]]'s mother, [[Emma of Normandy]]. According to legend, she was accused of [[adultery]] with Bishop [[Ælfwine of Winchester]], but proved her innocence by walking barefoot unharmed over burning ploughshares.

During the [[First Crusade]], the mystic [[Peter Bartholomew]] allegedly went through the ordeal by fire in 1099 by his own choice to disprove a charge that his claimed discovery of the [[Holy Lance]] was fraudulent. He died as a result of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades: Volume 1, The First Crusade and the Foundation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Trial by ordeal was adopted in the 13th century by the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Despotate of Epirus]]; Michael Angold speculates this legal innovation was most likely through "the numerous western mercenaries in Byzantine service both before and after 1204."&lt;ref&gt;Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'', (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to prove the innocence of the accused in cases of treason and use of magic to affect the health of the emperor. The most famous case where this employed was when [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]] was accused of treason: he avoided enduring the red-iron by saying he would only hold it if the [[metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Phokas (Byzantine family)|Phokas]] of [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]] could take the iron from the altar with his own hands and hand it to him.&lt;ref&gt;Denno J. Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West'' (Harvard University Press, 1959), pp. 23f&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Byzantines viewed trial of ordeal with disgust and considered it a barbarian innovation at odds with [[Byzantine law]] and ecclesiastical canons. Angold notes, "Its abolition by Michael Palaiologos was universally acclaimed."&lt;ref&gt;Angold, ''Byzantine Government'', p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]], the leader of a reform movement in Florence who claimed apocalyptic prophetic visions, attempted to prove the divine sanction of his mission by undergoing a trial by fire. The first of its kind for over 400 years, the trial was a fiasco for Savonarola, since a sudden rain doused the flames, canceling the event, and was taken by onlookers as a sign from God against him. The Holy Inquisition arrested him shortly thereafter, with Savonarola convicted of heresy and hanged at the Piazza della Signoria in Florence.

Ordeal by fire ([[Persian language|Persian]]:'''ور''' ) was also used for judiciary purposes in [[ancient Iran]]. Persons accused of cheating in contracts or lying might be asked to prove their innocence by ordeal of fire as an ultimate test. Two examples of such an ordeal include the accused having to pass through fire, or having molten metal poured on his chest. There were about 30 of these kinds of fiery tests in all. If the accused died, he was held to have been guilty; if survived, he was innocent, having been protected by [[Mithra]] and the other gods. The most simple form of such ordeals required the accused to take an oath, then drink a potion of [[sulphur]] ([[Avestan language]] ''saokant'', [[Middle Persian]] ''sōgand'', [[Modern Persian]] ''sowgand''). They thought fire has an association with truth, and hence with [[asha]].&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atas-fire | title=Ātaš | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation | accessdate=24 September 2013 | last=Boyce | first=Mary | year=2001 | volume=3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014545/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/atas-fire | archivedate=28 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient India, the trial by fire was known as ''agnipariksha'', in which [[Agni]], the Fire God, would be invoked by a priest using mantras. After the invocation, a [[pyre]] is built and lit, and the accused would be asked to sit on it. According to Hindu Mythology, the Fire God would preserve the accused if he was innocent, if not, he would be burned to ashes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===By water===
====Hot water====
First mentioned in the 6th-century ''[[Lex Salica]]'', the ordeal of hot water required the accused to dip his hand in a kettle or pot of boiling water (sometimes oil or lead was used instead) and retrieve a stone. The assessment of the injury and the consequences of a miracle or lack of one, followed a similar procedure to that described above. An early (non-judicial) example of the test was described by [[Gregory of Tours]] in the late 6th century. He describes how a Catholic saint, Hyacinth, bested an [[Arianism|Arian]] rival by plucking a stone from a boiling [[cauldron]]. Gregory said that it took Hyacinth about an hour to complete the task (because the waters were bubbling so ferociously), but he was pleased to record that when the [[heresy|heretic]] tried, he had the skin boiled off up to his elbow.

Legal texts from reign of [[King Athelstan]] provide some of the most elaborate royal regulations for the use of the ordeal in Anglo-Saxon England, though the period's fullest account of ordeal practices is found in an anonymous legal text written some time in the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wormald, ''The Making of English Law: King Alfred to the Twelfth Century, Vol I: Legislation and its Limits'' (Oxford, 1999), pp.373-4&lt;/ref&gt; According to this text, usually given the title ''Ordal'', the water had to be close to boiling temperature, and the depth from which the stone had to be retrieved was up to the wrist for a 'one-fold' ordeal and up to the elbow for a 'three-fold' ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;F. Liebermann, ''Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen vol. I: Text und Übersetzung'' (Halle, 1903), p.386&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between the one-fold and three-fold ordeal appears to be based on the severity of the crime, with the three-fold ordeal being prescribed for more severe offences such as treachery or for notorious criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wormald, ''Papers Preparatory to the Making of English Law, vol. II: From God's Law to Common Law'', ed. Stephen Baxter and John Hudson (2014), pp.78-9 at {{cite web |url=http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/reference/wormald/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141001090436/http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/reference/wormald/ |archivedate=2014-10-01 |df= }}. See for example, II As 4, 5, 6.1, I Atr 1.1, III Atr 3.4, V Atr 30, VI Atr 37, II Cn 30 all in Liebermann, ''Gesetze vol 1''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordeal would take place in the church, with several in attendance, purified and praying God to reveal the truth. Afterwards, the hand was bound and examined after three days to see whether it was healing or [[festering]].&lt;ref name="KingAthelstan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp#The%20Laws%20of%20King%20Athelstan | title=The Laws of King Athelstan 924-939 A.D. | publisher=Fordham University | work=Internet Medieval Sourcebook | date=21 June 1998 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | editor-first1=Paul | editor-last1=Halsall | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006150341/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp#The%20Laws%20of%20King%20Athelstan | archivedate=6 October 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was still a practice of 12th-century Catholic churches. A suspect would place his hand in the boiling water. If after three days God had not healed his wounds, the suspect was guilty of the crime.&lt;ref name="WaterOrdeal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/water-ordeal.html | title=Ordeal of Boiling Water, 12th or 13th Century | publisher=Fordham University | work=Internet Medieval Sourcebook | date=January 1996 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | editor-first1=Paul | editor-last1=Halsall | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108084524/http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/source/water-ordeal.html | archivedate=8 November 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ordeal of water.jpg|thumb|Water-ordeal. Engraving, 17th century.]]
Trial by ordeal mostly took place in a church because it was believed that God could watch over and decide if they were innocent.

====Cold water====
The ordeal of cold water has a precedent in the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] and the [[Code of Hammurabi]], under which a man accused of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] was to be submerged in a stream and acquitted if he survived. The practice was also set out in Frankish law but was abolished by [[Louis the Pious]] in 829. The practice reappeared in the [[Late Middle Ages]]: in the ''[[Dreieicher Wildbann]]'' of 1338, a man accused of [[poaching]] was to be submerged in a [[barrel]] three times and to be considered innocent if he sank, and guilty if he floated.

====Witch-hunts====
Ordeal by water was later associated with the [[witch-hunt]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, although in this scenario the outcome was an accused who sank was considered innocent, while floating indicated [[witchcraft]]. [[Demonologists]] developed inventive new theories about how it worked. The ordeal would normally be conducted with a rope holding the subject connected to assistants sitting in a boat or the like, so that the person being tested could be pulled in if he/she did not float; the notion that the ordeal was flatly devised as a situation without any possibility of live acquittal, even if the outcome was 'innocent', is a modern exaggeration{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Some argued that witches floated because they had renounced [[baptism]] when entering the [[Devil]]'s service. Jacob Rickius claimed that they were supernaturally light and recommended weighing them as an alternative to dunking them; this procedure and its status as an alternative to dunking were parodied in the 1975 British film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.&lt;ref name="źaJermaine1866"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/superstitionand05leagoog | title=Superstition and Force | publisher=Collins, Printer | author=Lea, Henry C. | authorlink=Henry Charles Lea | year=1866 | location=Philadelphia | oclc=18128359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James I of England|King James VI of Scotland]] (later also James I of England) claimed in his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' that water was so pure an element that it repelled the guilty. A witch trial including this ordeal took place in [[Szeged]], [[Hungary]] as late as 1728.&lt;!--Original reference text: Böhmer, ''ius eccles.'' -- If someone can find the actual page, then please add it--&gt;&lt;ref name="Boehmer"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3BMAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Jus ecclesiasticum protestantium | publisher=Impensis Orphanotrophei | last=Böhmer | first=Justus Henning | authorlink=Justus Henning Böhmer | language=Latin | ol=17577078M | year=1744 | location=Halle-Magdeburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordeal of water is also contemplated by the [[Vishnu Smrti]],&lt;ref name="Jolly1880" /&gt; which is one of the texts of the [[Dharmaśāstra]].&lt;ref name="Jolly1880"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=XII | chapterurl=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe07/sbe07014.htm | editor1-first=F.

===By cross===
The ordeal of the cross was apparently introduced in the [[Early Middle Ages]] in an attempt to discourage [[judicial duels]] among [[Germanic peoples]]. As with judicial duels, and unlike most other ordeals, the accuser had to undergo the ordeal together with the accused. They stood on either side of a cross and stretched out their hands horizontally. The one to first lower his arms lost. This ordeal was prescribed by [[Charlemagne]] in 779 and again in 806. A capitulary of [[Louis the Pious]] in 819&lt;ref name="MGH"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=VII. Hludowici Pii Capitularia 814-837 | editor1-first=Alfredus | editor1-last=Boretius | editor1-link=:de:Alfred Boretius | title=[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Capitularia regum Francorum I | publisher=Societas Aperiendis Fontibus Rerum Germa | year=1883 | location=Hannover | page=279 | language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decree of [[Lothar I]], recorded in 876, abolished the ordeal so as to avoid the mockery of Christ.

===By ingestion===
{{Main|Corsned}}
[[Franconia]]n law prescribed that an accused was to be given dry bread and cheese blessed by a priest. If he choked on the food, he was considered guilty. This was transformed into the ordeal of the [[Eucharist]] (trial by sacrament) mentioned by [[Regino of Prüm]] ca. 900:AD; the accused was to take the oath of innocence. It was believed that if the oath had been false, the person would die within the same year.

Both versions are essentially the opposite of ordeals, as they rely on the guilty parties' self-incrimination, while providing what amounts to a presumption of innocence. They are designed to be harmless and merciful. For how it was used in [[Anglo-Saxon]] England, see [[Corsned]].

[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 5:12&amp;ndash;27 prescribes that a woman suspected of adultery—one called a ''[[Sotah]]'' in later commentaries—should be made to swallow "[[Ordeal of the bitter water|the bitter water that causeth the curse]]" by the priest in order to determine her guilt. The accused would be condemned only if 'her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot'. One writer has recently argued that the procedure has a rational basis, envisioning punishment only upon clear proof of [[pregnancy]] (a swelling belly) or [[sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] (a rotting thigh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Trial: A History from Socrates to O.J.

===By poison===
[[File:Tangena trial by ordeal Madagascar.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=in an ominous and dark tropical forest, a person lays on the ground, surrounded by men with spears, as a crowd looks on|A 19th-century artist's depiction of the ''[[tangena]]'' ordeal in Madagascar]]
Some cultures, such as the [[Efik people|Efik Uburutu]] people of present-day [[Nigeria]], would administer the poisonous [[Calabar bean]] (''Physostigma venenosum''; known as ''esere'' in  [[Ibibio language|Efik]]) in an attempt to detect guilt. A defendant who vomited up the bean was innocent. A defendant who became ill or died was considered guilty.&lt;ref name=FloraDelaterre&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delaterre|first1=Flora|title=Calabar Bean|url=http://www.floradelaterre.com/?id=19|website=Flora Delaterre The Plant Detective|accessdate=10 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512223614/http://www.floradelaterre.com/?id=19|archivedate=12 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of [[Madagascar]] could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity, and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of ''[[tangena]]'' was routinely obligatory. In the 1820s, ingestion of the poisonous nut caused about 1,000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861.&lt;ref name="Stats"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The state and pre-colonial demographic history: the case of nineteenth century Madagascar | date=October 1991 | last=Campbell | first=Gwyn | journal=Journal of African History | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=415&amp;ndash;445 | jstor=182662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early modern Europe, the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] was unofficially used as a form of poison ordeal: a suspected party was forced to take the [[Eucharist]] on the grounds that, if he was guilty, he would be eternally damned, and hence his willingness to take the test would give an indication of his guilt.&lt;ref name="Thomas1971"&gt;{{cite book | title=Religion and the Decline of Magic | publisher=Folio Society | authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) | year=2012 | location=London | origyear=1st pub. 1971 | page=42 | oclc=805007047 | first1=Keith | last1=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By boiling oil===
Trial by boiling oil has been practiced in villages in certain parts of [[West Africa]], such as [[Togo]].&lt;ref name="Togo_oil"&gt;{{cite episode | url=http://www.tv.com/taboo/justice/episode/931067/summary.html | title=Justice | series=[[Taboo (2002 TV series)|Taboo]] | network=National Geographic | airdate=6 October 2003 | season=2 | number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main alternatives of this trial. In one version, the accused parties are ordered to retrieve an item from a container of boiling oil, with those who refuse the task being found guilty.&lt;ref name="India_oil"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/men-undergo-trial-by-boiling-oil-over-stolen-food-78929.html | title=Men undergo trial by boiling water over stolen food | work=The Irish Independent | date=19 September 2006 | location=Dublin | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015023315/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/men-undergo-trial-by-boiling-oil-over-stolen-food-78929.html | archivedate=15 October 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other version of the trial, both the accused and the accuser have to retrieve an item from boiling oil, with the person or persons whose hand remains unscathed being declared innocent.&lt;ref name="Togo_oil"/&gt;

===By turf===
An [[Iceland]]ic ordeal tradition involves the accused walking under a piece of turf. If the turf falls on the accused's head, the accused person is pronounced guilty.&lt;ref name="Miller1988"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ordeal in Iceland | journal=Scandinavian Studies | year=1988 | volume=60 | issue=2 | pages=189–218 | jstor=40918943 | first1=William Ian | last1=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English common law==
The ordeals of fire and water in England likely have their origin in Frankish tradition, as the earliest mention of the ordeal of the cauldron is in the first [[recension]] of the [[Salic Law]] in 510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial by cauldron was an ancient Frankish custom used against both freedmen and slaves in cases of theft, false witness and contempt of court, where the accused was made to plunge his right hand into a boiling cauldron and pull out a ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=4, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Frankish influence spread throughout Europe, ordeal by cauldron spread to neighboring societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest references of ordeal by cauldron in the British Isles occurs in Irish law in the seventh century, but it is unlikely that this tradition shares roots with the Frankish tradition that is likely the source of trial by fire and water among the Anglo-Saxons and later the Normans in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], king of the West Saxons, produced around 690, contains the earliest reference to ordeal in Anglo-Saxon law; however, this is the last and only mention of ordeal in Anglo-Saxon England until the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Conquest of 1066]], the Old English customs of proof were repeated anew and in more detailed fashion by the Normans, but the only notable innovation of the ordeal by the conquerors was the introduction of the trial by battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, minor conflicts between the customs of the Anglo-Saxons and the customs Normans that were typically resolved in ways that favored the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous story from [[Eadmer]]'s ''Historia novorum in Anglia'', [[William Rufus]] expresses skepticism about the ordeal after fifty men accused of forest offenses were exonerated by the ordeal of hot iron. In this story, Rufus states that he will take judgment from God's hands into his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Hyams|editor1-last=Arnold|editor1-first=Morris S.|title=On the Laws and Customs of England. Essays in Honor of Samuel E. Thorne|date=1981|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this skepticism was not universally shared by the intellectuals of the day, and [[Eadmer]] depicts Rufus as irreligious for rejecting the legitimacy of the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the ordeal in medieval England was very sensitive to status and reputation in the community. The laws of [[Canute]] distinguish between "men of good repute" who were able to clear themselves by their own oath, "untrustworthy men" who required [[compurgation|compurgators]], and untrustworthy men who cannot find compurgators who must go to the ordeal. One of the laws of [[Ethelred the Unready]] declared that untrustworthy men were to be sent to the triple ordeal, that is, an ordeal of hot iron where the iron is three times heavier than that used in the simple ordeal, unless his lord and two other knights swear that he has not been accused of a crime recently, in which case he would be sent to an ordinary ordeal of hot iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other European societies, the English rarely employed the ordeal in non-criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandatory use of the ordeal in certain criminal proceedings appears to date from the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Margaret H.|last2=Forsyth|first2=Richard D.|last3=Plyley|first3=Michael J.|title=Cold Water and Hot Iron: Trial by Ordeal in England|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|date=1992|volume=22|issue=4|page=1|doi=10.2307/205237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to then, compurgation was the most usual method of proof, and the ordeal was used in cases where there was some presumption of guilt against the accused or when the accused was bound to fail in compurgation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Margaret H.|last2=Forsyth|first2=Richard D.|last3=Plyley|first3=Michael J.|title=Cold Water and Hot Iron: Trial by Ordeal in England|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|date=1992|volume=22|issue=4|page=3|doi=10.2307/205237}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction was made between those accused ''fama publica'' (by public outcry) and those accused on the basis of specific facts. Those accused ''fama publica'' were able to exculpate themselves by means of compurgation, whereas those accused on the basis of specific facts and those who were thought to have bad character were made to undergo the ordeal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groot|first1=Roger D.|title=The Jury of Presentment Before 1215|journal=The American Journal of Legal History|date=1982|volume=26|issue=1|page=23|doi=10.2307/844604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assize of Clarendon declared that all those said by a jury of presentment to be "accused or notoriously suspect" of robbery, thievery, or murder or of receiving anyone who had committed such a wrong were to be put to the ordeal of water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These juries of presentment were the [[Hundred (county division)#Hundred courts|hundred juries]] and [[vill]]s, and these groups, in effect, made the intermediate decision of whether an accused person would face the more final judgment of the ordeal. These bodies rendered "verdicts" of either suspected or not suspected. In cases where the defendant was accused on the basis of one or more specific facts, the defendant was sent to the ordeal upon the verdict of the hundred jury alone. In cases where the defendant was accused ''fama publica'', the agreement of the hundred jurors and the vills as to the defendant's suspicion was required to send him to the ordeal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, the intermediate accusation of the juries could still be considered final in some sense as any person who was accused of murder by the juries was required to leave the realm even if he was exonerated by the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1215, clergy were forbidden to participate in ordeals by the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]. The English plea rolls contain no cases of trial by ordeal after 1219, when [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] recognized its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|title=Trial by Fire and Water|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suppression ==

[[Pope]]s were generally opposed to ordeals, although there are some apocryphal accounts describing their cooperation with the practice.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Ordeals}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first there was no general decree against ordeals, and they were only declared unlawful in individual cases.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; Eventually [[Pope Innocent III]] in [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) promulgated a canon forbidding blessing of participants before ordeals.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; This decision was followed by further prohibitions by [[synod]]s in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt; The Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] (1194-1250AD) was the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered ''irrational'' ([[Constitutions of Melfi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore?|url=http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053347/http://www.stupormundi.it/Houben1.htm|archivedate=2015-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stupormundi.it/it/ma-limperatore-svevo-fu-conservatore-o-innovatore|title=Ma l'imperatore svevo fu conservatore o innovatore? - Stupor Mundi|author=|date=|website=www.stupormundi.it|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202422/http://www.stupormundi.it/it/ma-limperatore-svevo-fu-conservatore-o-innovatore|archivedate=26 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, things started to change with [[Henry III of England]] (1220).

From the twelfth century, the ordeals started to be generally disapproved and they were discontinued during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. However, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries some kinds of ordeals were once again used in [[witch-hunt]]s.&lt;ref name="CathEnc" /&gt;

==Theoretical approaches==

According to a theory put forward by economics professor [[Peter Leeson]], trial by ordeal may have been effective at sorting the guilty from the innocent.&lt;ref name="Leeson2012"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Peter T. | last1=Leeson | url=http://www.peterleeson.com/Ordeals.pdf | title=Ordeals | accessdate=3 October 2014 | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | date=August 2012 | volume=55 | issue=3 | pages=691–714 | jstor=10.1086/664010 | author-link1=Peter Leeson | doi=10.1086/664010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117110839/http://www.peterleeson.com/Ordeals.pdf | archivedate=17 November 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the assumption that defendants were believers in divine intervention for the innocent, then only the truly innocent would choose to endure a trial; guilty defendants would confess or settle cases instead. Therefore, the theory goes, church and judicial authorities could routinely rig ordeals so that the participants—presumably innocent—could pass them.&lt;ref name="Leeson2010"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/01/31/justice_medieval_style/ | title=Justice, medieval style | work=Boston Sunday Globe | date=31 January 2010 | accessdate=3 October 2014 | first1=Peter | last1=Leeson | location=Boston, Massachusetts | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114539/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/01/31/justice_medieval_style/ | archivedate=6 October 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To support this theory, Leeson points to the great latitude given to the priests in administering the ordeal and interpreting the results of the ordeal. He also points to the overall high exoneration rate of accused persons undergoing the ordeal, when intuitively one would expect a very high proportion of people carrying a red hot iron to be badly burned and thus fail the ordeal.&lt;ref name="Leeson2012"/&gt; 
[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] explains the persistence and eventual withering of the ordeal by stating that it helped promote consensus in a society where people lived in close quarters and there was little centralized power. In a world where "the sacred penetrated into the chinks of the profane and vice-versa" the ordeal was a "controlled miracle" that served as a point of consensus when one of the greatest dangers to the community was feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=Society and the Supernatural: A Medieval Change|journal=Daedalus|date=Spring 1975|volume=104|issue=2|pages=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this analysis, Brown argues that the increasing authoritativeness of the state lessened the need and desire for the ordeal as an instrument of consensus, which ultimately led to its disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=Society and the Supernatural: A Medieval Change|journal=Daedalus|date=Spring 1975|volume=104|issue=2|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10299">'''Ultimogeniture''', also known as '''postremogeniture''' or '''junior right''', is the tradition of [[inheritance]] by the last-born of a privileged position in a parent's wealth or office.  The tradition has been far rarer historically than [[primogeniture]] (sole inheritance by the first-born) or [[partible inheritance]] (division of the estate among the children).

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Ultimogeniture might be considered appropriate in circumstances where the youngest child had been assigned the role of "keeping the hearth", taking care of the parents and continuing at home, whereas elder children had had time and opportunity to succeed in the world and provide for themselves. In a variation on the system, elder children might have received a share of land and moveable property at a younger age, for example when marrying and founding their own family. Ultimogeniture might also be considered appropriate for the estates of elderly rulers and property-owners, whose children were likely to be mature adults.

There are several disadvantages for realms and families that adopt ultimogeniture.  One such drawback is the fact that elder siblings, especially the first born of the relevant gender, will be heavily incentivized to sidestep the tradition, even more so if primogeniture inheritance is a familiar concept. And since the elder siblings likely have more time and opportunities to gain power, wealth, experience, and influence prior to the inheritance—simply because they were born earlier—ultimogeniture traditions are more likely to be disregarded or even discarded.

[[Coercion]], [[assassination]], [[fratricide]], or even [[patricide]] can be committed, backed by all the advantage an elder sibling would have, such that ultimogeniture is sidestepped.
To clarify, those who stand to gain by ignoring the stipulation under ultimogeniture are more likely to have the facility to do so, when compared to other succession laws. For example, under primogeniture tradition, the younger siblings will stand to gain if they can bypass said tradition, but the elder siblings still have the aforementioned advantages, so primogeniture traditions tend to persist.

==Usage examples==
* Many [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions around the world include important figures who were youngest siblings, although they are subject to various interpretations. Several important [[Biblical]] characters—including [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], and [[David]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=729&amp;letter=J |title=Jewish Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;—are described as youngest sons or daughters, leading some scholars to propose a prehistoric practice of ultimogeniture among the [[Hebrews]], although this form of inheritance is not espoused by the preserved text.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Deut|21|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some early [[Greek myth]]s, [[Greek kingship|kingship]] was conferred by marriage to a tribal [[nymph]], who was selected by ultimogeniture or success in a race.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://uk.geocities.com/lucath/myths.html |title="Myths" (Geocities) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115650/http://uk.geocities.com/lucath/myths.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[England]], patrilineal ultimogeniture (i.e., inheritance by the youngest surviving male child) is known as '''Borough English''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Alternatively rendered as '''borough English''' and '''Borough-English'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}}} after its former practice in various ancient [[England|English]] [[borough]]s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} It was only enforced against those who died [[intestate]] and frequently—though not universally—also included the principle of inheritance by the deceased's youngest brother when there was no son.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Less often, the practice was extended to the youngest daughter, sister, aunt, etc.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Its origin is much disputed, although the [[Anglo-Normans|Normans]]—who generally practiced [[primogeniture]]—considered it to be a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] legacy.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} A 1327 court case found it to be the practice of the English burgh at [[Nottingham]], although not of that town's "French" district.&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook of 22 Edward IV. fol. 32b.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition was also found across many rural areas of England where lands were held in tenure by [[Soke (legal)|socage]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} It also occurred in [[copyhold]] [[manor]]s in [[Hampshire]], [[Surrey]], [[Middlesex]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} [[Suffolk]], and [[Sussex]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} where manorial custom dictated the form of inheritance to be ultimogeniture.
* In the German Duchy of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], land-holdings traditionally passed to the youngest son, who might then employ his older brothers as farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopædia Britannica, ''9th ed.'' |contribution=Saxe-Altenburg }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[India]], matrilineal ultimogeniture is practiced by the [[Khasi people]] of [[Meghalaya]], wherein inheritance is traditionally passed down to the youngest daughter. Although portions of the property are divided among siblings, the bulk of the share, including the "ancestral hearth", is bestowed on the youngest daughter ({{lang|kha| ka khadduh}}), who is also expected to take care of the aging parents, as well as any unmarried siblings. As a consequence, marriage to the youngest daughter is [[uxorilocal]], as opposed to marriage to the other siblings, which is [[neolocal]].
* Among the Malabar [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] community of [[Kerala]] in southern India, a variant of ultimogeniture is practised, where the youngest son gets the ancestral house (''[[tharavad]]'') and adjoining property and is expected to take care of his elderly parents, while his elder brothers also get a share of the property though they live separately; the daughters are granted a bounteous dowry but traditionally do not receive inheritance of property.&lt;ref name="paper_dowry_syrian_christian_2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ycZjQeZ278C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;q=Ultimogeniture|title=“Stridhanam: Rethinking Dowry, Inheritance and Women's Resistance Among the Syrian Christians of Kerala.” Anthropologica|last=Philips|first=Amali|date=2003|publisher=Canadian Anthropology Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book_syrian_christian_2014"/&gt; Only if there are no sons, the husband of the youngest daughter is formally embraced into the family as adopted son (''dathu puthran'') to fulfill the role of the youngest son. &lt;ref name="book_syrian_christian_2014"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt6vAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT480&amp;q=youngest+son|title=Eastern Christianity and Politics in the Twenty-First Century|last=Leustean|first=Lucian N.|date=2014-05-30|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317818656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paper_dowry_syrian_christian_2003"/&gt;
* In some southwestern areas of [[Japan]], property was traditionally apportioned by a modified version of ultimogeniture known as ''masshi souzoku'' ({{lang|ja|末子相続}}).  An estate was distributed equally among all sons or children, except that the youngest received a double share as a reward for caring for the elderly parents in their last years. Official surveys conducted during the early years of the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era demonstrated that the most common family form throughout the country during the [[Edo period]] was characterized by stem structure, patrilineal descent, patrivirilocal{{clarify|date=August 2017}} residence and patrilineal [[primogeniture]], but in some southwestern areas this combination of partible inheritance and ultimogeniture was sometimes employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Family History Revisited: Comparative Perspectives |editor-last=Wall |editor-first=Richard Wall |editor2-first=Tamara K. |editor2-last=Hareven |editor3-first=Joseph |editor3-last=Ehmer |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8awruI9XyXsC&amp;pg=PA343 343–344]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Among [[Mongols]], each son received part of the family herd as he married, with the elder sons receiving more than the younger ones, but the ancestral seat was inherited by the youngest along with his share of the herd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Influence of the Great Code "Yasa" on the Mongolian Empire |url=http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615073730/http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm |archivedate=2013-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, each son inherited part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder sons receiving more than the younger ones, but further afield from the family tent. (Family units would often remain near enough for close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations.){{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Similarly, [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[Mongolian Empire|empire]] was divided among all four of his sons, but the [[Mongolia|Mongolian homeland]] was passed to his youngest, [[Tolui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200301/the.arts.of.the.mongols.htm |title="The Arts of the Mongols"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Kachin people|Kachin]] of northern [[Burma]] and southern [[China]] traditionally instruct elder sons to move away upon maturity, leaving the youngest son to inherit the family property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://victoria.linguistlist.org/~lapolla/rda/EO.htm |title=(Linguist List) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Environmental law}}

The term ‘'''wild law'''’ was first coined by [[Cormac Cullinan]], to refer to human laws that are consistent with [[Earth jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discovering the meaning of Earth jurisprudence|publisher= Legalbrief |url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=2002082769459999|date= August 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wild law is a law made by people to regulate human behaviour that privileges maintaining the integrity and functioning of the whole Earth community in the long term, over the interests of any species (including humans) at a particular time.

==Background==

[[File:Amazon Rainforest-bird site.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in Brazil.]]

Wild laws are designed to regulate human participation within this wider community.  They seek to balance the rights and responsibilities of humans against those of other members of the community of beings within the [[natural environment]] that constitutes Earth (e.g. [[plants]], animals, [[rivers]], and [[ecosystems]]) in order to safe-guard the rights of all the members of the Earth [[community]].

Wild laws may be distinguished from laws based on the understanding that Earth is a conglomeration of objects which human beings are entitled to exploit for their exclusive benefit (e.g. most property laws).  The development of wild laws is motivated partially by the belief that it is desirable, and essential to the survival of many species (probably including humans), for us to change our relationship with the natural world from one of exploitation to a more ‘democratic’ participation in a community of other beings.  This requires laws that firstly, recognise that other members of the Earth community have [[rights]], and secondly, restrain humans from unjustifiably infringing those rights (as is done within the human community).

==Applications and consensus==

As a field, wild law cannot easily be categorised within traditional legal categories (e.g. [[substantive law|substantive]], [[procedural law|procedural]], [[private law|private]] or [[public law]]).  It is perhaps better understood as an approach to [[good governance|human governance]], rather than as a branch of law or a collection of laws.

A conference based on the concept of wild law was held in November 2005 at the [[University of Brighton]], UK. The conference was chaired by former Environment Minister [[Michael Meacher]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and speakers included Jacqueline McGlade, head of the [[European Environment Agency]] and Lynda Warren of the [[Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Former Environment Minister leads debate on 'Wild Law'|date=14 November 2005|url=http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2005/051114wildlaw.php?PageId=825|publisher=[[University of Brighton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, a conference based on the book ''Wild Law'' by Cormac Cullinan was held at the University of Brighton, UK, and organised jointly by [[UKELA]] and [[Environmental Law Foundation|ELF]]. 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law' and was chaired by John Elkington (of [[SustainAbility]] and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, [[Norman Baker]] MP (former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Environment Spokesman), [[Satish Kumar]] (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).

"A ‘Wild Law’ Response to Climate Change" workshop was held in September 2007 to develop a practical approach for applying Wild Law principles which are already helping shift legal processes in the US and South Africa.  Organised by [[UKELA]], with support from [[Environmental Law Foundation|ELF]] and the [[Gaia Foundation]], London and sponsored by [[The Body Shop]].  Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire in the UK, with internationally renowned speakers [[Cormac Cullinan]], author of ''Wild Law'', [[Brian Goodwin|Professor Brian Goodwin]], visiting scholar and teacher on MSc in Holistic Science, at the [[Schumacher College]], International Centre for Ecological Studies, Devon, Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of The [[Center for Food Safety]] in USA and founder of the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]], Peter Roderick, director of the Climate Justice Programme and was [[Friends of the Earth]]'s lawyer in London from 1996.

The "’Wild Law’ - Ideas into Action" residential workshop is to be held in September 2008, to launch the first phase of international research by the [[UKELA]] and the [[Gaia Foundation]] to identify Wild Law in practice and provide a Wild Law toolkit for decision makers and practitioners. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire, UK, workshop leaders include: [[Mellese Damtie]], Ethiopian lawyer and biologist, former Dean of the Legal Department at Ethiopia's Civil Service College, [[Andrew Kimbrell]], public interest attorney, activist and author, executive director of the Centre for Food Safety in USA and founder of the [[International Centre for Technology Assessment]]; and [[Professor Lynda Warren]], emeritus professor at [[Aberystwyth University]], environmental consultant and the research supervisor. Also participating, research paper coordinators, Begonia Filgueira, of Gaia Law Ltd and ERIC Ltd, and Ian Mason, practising barrister and Director of the [[Earth Jurisprudence Resource Centre]]; [[Cormac Cullinan]], an environmental lawyer based in Cape Town, South Africa, author of ''Wild Law'', director of the leading South African environmental law firm, Cullinan and Associates Inc., and CEO of EnAct International, an environmental governance consultancy; and [[Ng’anga Thiong’o]], legal and policy adviser for Kenyan community NGO, [[Porini]], and formerly to Green Belt Movement and Nobel prize winner, [[Wangari Maathai]]. This event is facilitated by Elizabeth Rivers, former commercial lawyer and professional facilitator, and Vicki Elcoate, Executive Director of UKELA.
