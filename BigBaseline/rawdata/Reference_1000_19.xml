[[File:Apple and Orange - they do not compare.jpg|right|thumb|An apple and an orange]]
[[File:Paul Cézanne 179.jpg|Right|thumb|''Apples and Oranges'', by [[Paul Cézanne]].]]

A comparison of '''apples and oranges''' occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.

The [[idiom]], ''comparing apples and oranges'', refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or [[unit commensurability|incommensurable]], such as [[apple]]s and [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a [[false analogy]] has been made between two items, such as where an ''apple'' is faulted for not being a good ''orange''.

==Variants==
{{multiple issues|
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}}}
The idiom is not unique to English. In [[Quebec French]], it may take the form ''comparer des pommes avec des oranges'' (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says ''comparer des pommes et des poires'' (to compare apples and pears). In [[Latin America]]n Spanish, it is usually ''comparar papas y boniatos'' (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all [[Spanish dialects and varieties|varieties of Spanish]] ''comparar peras con manzanas'' (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and [[pear]]s are compared in [[Danish language|Danish]], Dutch, German, Spanish, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is ''sumar peras con manzanas'', that is, ''to add pears and apples''; the same thing applies in Italian (''sommare le mele con le pere'') and Romanian (''a aduna merele cu perele''). In Portuguese, the expression is ''comparar laranjas com bananas'' (compare orange to banana).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/esportes/osorio-sobre-o-pan-e-as-olimpiadas-estao-comparando-banana-com-laranja-bxxxe6v1cotxnsrh5vowm64pa Olimpíadas: "Estão comparando banana com laranja"], ''Gazeta do Povo'', 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Czech, the idiom ''míchat jablka s hruškami'' literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.

[[Image:Apples.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Not all apples are alike.]]

Some languages use completely different items, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Поредити бабе и жабе'' (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''baba şi mitraliera'' (the grandmother and the machine gun); ''vaca şi izmenele'' (the cow and the longjohns); or ''țiganul şi carioca'' (the gypsy and the marker), or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''mor wahanol â mêl a menyn'' (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent [[Danish language|Danish]] idiom, ''Hvad er højest, [[Rundetårn]] eller et tordenskrald?'' means "What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In [[Russian language|Russian]], the phrase ''сравнивать тёплое с мягким'' (to compare warm and soft) is used. In [[Argentina]], a common question is ''¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?'' (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in [[Colombia]], a similar (though more rude) version is common: ''confundir la mierda con la pomada'' (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression ''co ma piernik do wiatraka?'' is used, meaning "What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning "horses and cattles won't mate with each other", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.

A number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, "oranges with orangutans", "apples with dishwashers", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.

Sometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian ''merele cu perele'' (apples and pears) and the Hungarian ''szezont a fazonnal'' (the season with the fashion).

==Published comparisons==
===Scientific===
[[Image:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|right|Oranges, like apples, grow on trees.]]
At least two [[tongue-in-cheek]] scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.

The first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the [[NASA Ames Research Center]], used [[infrared spectroscopy]] to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', concluded: "[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Scott A.|last=Sandford|url=https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume1/v1i3/air-1-3-apples.html|title=Apples and Oranges -- A Comparison|magazine=[[Annals of Improbable Research]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=1995|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study, written by [[Stamford Hospital]]'s [[surgeon]]-in-chief James Barone and published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]],'' noted that the phrase ''apples and oranges'' was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing "[[Desflurane]] and [[propofol]]" and "[[Salmeterol]] and [[ipratropium]]" with "apples and oranges". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in [[orchard]]s, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of [[seed]]s (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of [[Johnny Appleseed]], and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing apples and oranges: a randomised prospective study|first=James E|last=Barone|journal=British Medical Journal|year=2000|volume=321|issue=7276|page=1569|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1569|pmc=27565|pmid=11124178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annals of Improbable Research'' subsequently noted that the "earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment" than the ''British Medical Journal'' study.&lt;ref name="improbable"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=Marc|title=Apples and oranges have previously been shown to be remarkably similar|journal=BMJ|date=14 April 2001|volume=322|issue=7291|pages=931|pmc=1120087|pmid=11334040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2014, ''[[The Economist]]'' compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be "unrelated variables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/04/daily-chart|title=Daily chart: Comparing apples with oranges|work=The Economist|date=1 April 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In teaching the use of units==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2017}}
While references to comparing apples and oranges are often a [[rhetorical device]], references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of [[units of measurement|units]]. Here, the admonition not to "add apples and oranges" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be [[dimensional analysis#Dimensional homogeneity|combined in ratio form by multiplication]], so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used [[metaphor]]ically in [[elementary algebra]].

The admonition is really more of a [[mnemonic]], since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension ''fruit''; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.

Ask a Librarian is an official service of the Florida Electronic Library and is administered by the [[Tampa Bay Library Consortium]] (TBLC).

Participating libraries provide users with virtual reference services via [[live chat]] software, text messaging, and e-mail forms which users can access through embedded links and widgets on their library’s official website. Live chat and text messaging are available from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to midnight EST from Sunday through Thursday, and from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST on Friday and Saturday; the e-mail form is available to patrons 24 hours per day, seven days per week.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.askalibrarian.org/about|title=AskALibrarian.org: About|work=Ask A Librarian News and Information|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, Ask a Librarian has 133 participating institutions including public libraries and library systems, K-12 libraries, and university and college libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://info.askalibrarian.org/participating-libraries/|title=Participating Libraries|website=Ask a Librarian News and Information|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ask a Librarian began as a partnership between the [[College Center for Library Automation]] (CCLA) and TBLC in the interest of creating a statewide virtual reference service that would increase the presence of librarians on the internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sachs|first=Diana|date=2005|title=Ask a Librarian: Florida’s Virtual Reference Service|url=|journal=Community &amp; Junior College Libraries|volume=12|issue=4|pages=51–52|doi=10.1300/J107v12n04_06|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=2016-03-18--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the organizations successfully applied for a joint grant through the [[Library Services and Technology Act]] (LSTA) and were awarded $339,000 for the development and implementation of their pilot project as a service of the [[Florida Electronic Library]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ask a Librarian virtual reference service was officially activated on July 28, 2003.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay-area]] libraries were the first to participate, with [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]] libraries joining shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:TTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FCC97A666F1382A&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB5811D21E575|title=Librarians' Help Offered On Web|last=Richardson|first=Rachel|date=4 August 2003|newspaper=[[The Tampa Tribune]]|page=4|accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first year of operation, nearly 7,500 Floridians had used the service to get answers from a reference librarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:PBPB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=104BB78A4408DBED&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB5811D21E575|title=Library offering live, on-line help with research|last=Haase|first=Linda|date=25 August 2004|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|page=1 (Neighborhood Post)|accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, J. 2010"&gt;Ward, J., &amp; Barbier, P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">[[Image:Brand Book.png|thumb|right|150px|A Brand Book published by the Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association.]]
A '''Brand Book''' records all [[Livestock branding|livestock brands]] registered with an organization. In the U.S. most states have branding laws that require brands to be registered before use. This may be a state agency (usually affiliated with each state's [[List of agriculture ministries|Department of Agriculture]]) or a private association regulated by the state. Most states with such laws have a Brand Book for the entire state. [[Texas]], an exception, registers brands at the county level. These book are usually provided free to law enforcement personnel and County Extension Agents. Some states have their Brand Books available online.

A typical Brand Book will usually have an image of the brand, the location of the brand on the animal, and the type of animal that will be branded, as well as the owner of the brand. Many Brand Books also record earmarks.

Brand Books are used by law enforcement officials, brand inspectors, and association investigators to record and track livestock movement, deter loss of livestock by straying or theft, and prosecute thieves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2345">A '''breviograph''' or '''brevigraph''' (from {{lang-la|brevis}}, short, and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''grapho'', to write) is a type of [[scribal abbreviation]] in the form of an easily written symbol, character, flourish or stroke, based on a modified letter form to take the place of a common letter combination, especially those occurring at the beginning or end of a word. Breviographs were used frequently by stenographers, law clerks and scriveners, and they were also found in early printed books and tracts.&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Samuel A. ''The Handwriting of the Renaissance'' (1931), New York: Columbia UP, 125-134.&lt;/ref&gt; Their use declined after the 17th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28836">[[File:John 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Gospel according to John]] - a text showing chapter and verse divisions ([[King James Version]])]]

The [[Bible]] is a compilation of many [[books of the Bible|shorter books]] written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the [[biblical canon]]. Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible present all but the shortest of these books with divisions into [[chapter (books)| chapters]], generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses - each consisting of a few short lines or sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:8–9|9}}, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:2|9}}.

As the chapter and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts, they form part of the [[paratext]] of the Bible.

The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians.  For instance, in Jewish tradition, the ascriptions to many [[Psalms]] are regarded as independent verses or parts of the subsequent verses, making 116 more verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered.  Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. Hebrew Bibles have  {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|5:27–41|HE}} where Christian translations have {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:1–15|NIV}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Isaiah Wall.jpg|thumb|left|"...they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." ~ [[Isaiah 2:4]] KJV (Bible verse across the street from the [[United Nations Building]] in [[New York City]])]]

===Chapters===
Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers.  In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs ([[parashot]]) that were identified by two letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. [[Pe (letter)|Peh פ]] indicated an "open" paragraph that began on a new line, while [[Samekh|Samekh ס]] indicated a "closed" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; These two letters begin the Hebrew words open ('''''p'''atuach'') and closed ('''''s'''agoor''), and are, themselves, open פ and closed ס. The earliest known copies of the [[Book of Isaiah]] from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] divisions.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2&gt;Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'', n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is different from the use of consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet to structure certain poetic compositions, known as [[acrostic]]s, such as several of the [[Psalms]] and most of the [[Book of Lamentations]].)

The [[Hebrew Bible]] was also divided into some larger sections.  In Israel the [[Torah]] (its first five books) were divided into 154 sections so that they could be read through aloud in weekly worship over the course of three years. In Babylonia it was divided into 53 or 54 sections ([[Parashat ha-Shavua]]) so it could be read through in one year.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2/&gt;  The [[New Testament]] was divided into topical sections known as ''kephalaia'' by the fourth century. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] divided the gospels into parts that he listed in tables or ''canons''. Neither of these systems corresponds with modern chapter divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt and Barbara Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans and Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1989), pp. 252 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  (See fuller discussions below.)

Chapter divisions, with titles, are also found in the 9th century Tours manuscript, Paris Bibliothèque Nationale MS Lat. 3, the so-called Bible of Rorigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanaregia.eu/en/manuscripts/paris-bibliotheque-nationale-france-mss-latin-3/en|title=Europeana Regia - Paris Bibliothèque nationale de France MSS Latin 3|first=Europeana Regia|last=Consortium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Stephen Langton#Chapters of the Bible|Stephen Langton]] and Cardinal [[Hugo de Sancto Caro]] developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07175a.htm Hebrew Bible] article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The early versions of the New Testament: Their origin, transmission and limitations'', Oxford University Press (1977), p.347. Cited in [http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2013/06/21/stephen-langton-and-the-modern-chapter-divisions-of-the-bible/ Stephen Langton and the modern chapter divisions of the bible] by British translator Roger Pearse, 21 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

While chapter divisions have become nearly universal, editions of the Bible have sometimes been published without them.  Such editions, which typically use thematic or literary criteria to divide the biblical books instead, include [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul'' (1707),&lt;ref&gt;London: Awnsham and John Churchill, 1707&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell's]] ''The Sacred Writings'' (1826),&lt;ref&gt;1826; repr.

===Verses===
Since at least 916 the [[Tanakh]] has contained an extensive system of multiple levels of section, paragraph, and phrasal divisions that were indicated in [[Masoretic]] vocalization and [[cantillation|cantillation markings]].&lt;!-- page 75 --&gt; One of the most frequent of these was a special type of punctuation, the ''[[sof passuq]]'', symbol for a full stop or sentence break, resembling the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (:) of English and Latin orthography. With the advent of the printing press and the translation of the [[Bible]] into English, Old Testament versifications were made that correspond predominantly with the existing Hebrew full stops, with a few isolated exceptions. Most attribute these to Rabbi [[Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus]]'s work for the first Hebrew [[Bible concordance]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, G.F. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3259119 The Vulgate Chapters and Numbered Verses in the Hebrew Bible], pages 73–78 at [[JSTOR]]. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3259119?seq=3 page 75]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was Italian Dominican biblical scholar [[Santi Pagnini]] (1470–1541), but his system was never widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible: A History|author1=Miller, Stephen M. |author2=Huber, Robert V. |year=2004|publisher=Good Books|isbn=1-56148-414-8|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tools.pitts.emory.edu/Printer/|title = Pitts Theology Library Exhibit on the Verses of the New Testament|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Estienne]] created an alternate numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblestudymagazine.com/interactive/chaptersverses/ "Chapters and Verses: Who Needs Them?,"] Christopher R. Smith, Bible Study Magazine (July–Aug 2009): 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French. Estienne's system of division was widely adopted, and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles. Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text. Before this work, they were printed in the margins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by [[William Whittingham]] (c. 1524–1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the [[Geneva Bible]] published shortly afterwards in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles and the vast majority of those in other languages.  (Nevertheless, some Bibles have removed the verse numbering, including the ones noted above that also removed chapter numbers; a recent example of an edition that removed only verses, not chapters, is [[The Message (Bible)|''The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language'']] by [[Eugene H. Peterson]].)&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Springs: NavPress, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish tradition==
{{Main article|Tanakh#Chapters and verse numbers, book divisions}}
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic text]] of the Bible notes several different kinds of subdivisions within the biblical books:

===Verse endings===
{{Main article|Sof passuk}}
Most important are the verse endings. According to the [[Talmud]]ic tradition, the division of the text into verses is of ancient origin.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, ''Nedarim'' 37b&lt;/ref&gt; In Masoretic versions of the Bible, the end of a verse is indicated by a small mark in its final word called a ''silluq'' (which means "stop"). Less formally, verse endings are usually also indicated by two horizontal dots following the word with a ''silluq''.

===Parashiyot===
{{main article|Parashah}}
The Masoretic textual tradition also contains section endings called ''[[Parashah|parashot]]'', which are usually indicated by a space within a line (a "closed" section) or a new line beginning (an "open" section). The division of the text reflected in the ''parashot'' is usually thematic. Unlike chapters, the ''parashot'' are not numbered, but some of them have special titles.

In early manuscripts (most importantly in [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] Masoretic manuscripts, such as the [[Aleppo codex]]), an "open" section may also be represented by a blank line, and a "closed" section by a new line that is slightly indented (the preceding line may also not be full). These latter conventions are no longer used in Torah scrolls and printed [[Hebrew Bible]]s. In this system, the one rule differentiating "open" and "closed" sections is that "open" sections must ''always'' start at the beginning of a new line, while "closed" sections ''never'' start at the beginning of a new line.

===Sedarim===
Another division of the biblical books found in the Masoretic text is the division of the ''[[Seder (Bible)|sedarim]]''. This division is not thematic, but is almost entirely based upon the ''quantity'' of text. For the [[Torah]], this division reflects the triennial cycle of reading that was practiced by the Jews of the Land of Israel.

==Christian versions==
The Byzantines also introduced a concept roughly similar to chapter divisions, called ''kephalaia'' (singular ''kephalaion'', literally meaning ''heading'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetextofthegospels.com/2016/04/kephalaia-ancient-chapters-of-gospels.html |title=Kephalaia: The Ancient Chapters of the Gospels |last=Snapp | first=James |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system, which was in place no later than the 5th century, is not identical to the present chapters. Unlike the modern chapters, which tend to be of roughly similar length, the distance from one ''kephalaion'' mark to the next varied greatly in length both within a book and from one book to the next.  For example, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], comprising three chapters in the modern system, has but one ''kephalaion'' mark, while the single modern chapter 8 of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] has several, one per miracle.  Moreover, there were far fewer ''kephalaia'' in the [[Gospel of John]] than in the [[Gospel of Mark]], even though the latter is the shorter text. In the manuscripts, the ''kephalaia'' with their numbers, their standard titles (''titloi'') and their page numbers would be listed at the beginning of each biblical book; in the book's main body, they would be marked only with arrow-shaped or asterisk-like symbols in the margin, not in the text itself.

The titles usually referred to the first event or the first theological point of the section only, and some ''kephalaia'' are manifestly incomplete if one stops reading at the point where the next ''kephalaion'' begins (for example, the combined accounts of the miracles of the [[Daughter of Jairus]] and of the [[Christ healing the bleeding woman|healing of the woman with a haemorrhage]]  gets two marked ''kephalaia'', one titled ''of the daughter of the synagogue ruler'' at the beginning when the ruler approaches Jesus and one titled ''of the woman with the flow of blood'' where the woman enters the picture – well before the ruler's daughter is healed and the storyline of the previous ''kephalaion'' is thus properly concluded). Thus the ''kephalaia'' marks are rather more like a system of bookmarks or links into a continuous text, helping a reader to quickly find one of several well-known episodes, than like a true system of chapter divisions.

Cardinal [[Hugh of St Cher|Hugo de Sancto Caro]] is often given credit for first dividing the [[Latin Vulgate]] into chapters in the real sense, but it is the arrangement of his contemporary and fellow cardinal [[Stephen Langton]] who in 1205 created the chapter divisions which are used today. They were then inserted into Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in the 16th century. [[Robert Estienne]] (Robert Stephanus) was the first to number the verses within each chapter, his verse numbers entering printed editions in 1551 (New Testament) and 1571 (Hebrew Bible).&lt;ref name = "Examiner"&gt;[http://www.theexaminer.org/history/chap6.htm The Examiner].&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of the Bible into chapters and verses has received criticism from some traditionalists and modern scholars. Critics state that the text is often divided in an incoherent way, or at inappropriate rhetorical points, and that it encourages citing passages out of context. Nevertheless, the chapter and verse numbers have become indispensable as technical references for Bible study.

Several modern publications of the Bible have eliminated numbering of chapters and verses. [[Biblica]] published such a version of the [[NIV]] in 2007 and 2011. In 2014, [[Crossway Books|Crossway]] published the [[ESV]] Reader's Bible and ''[[Bibliotheca (Bible)|Bibliotheca]]'' published a modified ASV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zylstra |first=Sarah Eekhof |title=Introducing the Bible! Now with Less! |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/july-web-only/bibliotheca-readers-bible.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as Icthus&lt;ref name="Icthus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icthusapp.com|title=Icthus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also exist which strip chapter and verse numbers from existing translations.

=={{anchor|Statistics}}Protestant Bible statistics==
The number of words can vary depending upon aspects such as whether the Hebrew alphabet in Psalm 119, the superscriptions listed in some of the Psalms, and the subscripts traditionally found at the end of the Pauline epistles, are included.
Except where stated, the following apply to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in its modern 66-book Protestant form including the New Testament and the [[protocanonical]] Old Testament, not the [[deuterocanonical books]].

===Chapters===
* There are 929 chapters in the [[Old Testament]].
** 187 chapters in the Pentateuch
** 249 chapters in the Historical books
** 243 chapters in the Poetic books ("Wisdom")
** 183 chapters in the Major prophets
** 67 chapters in the Minor prophets
* There are 260 chapters in the [[New Testament]]. 
** 89 chapters in the Gospels
** 28 chapters in Acts
** 87 chapters in the Pauline Epistles (excluding Hebrews)
** 34 chapters in the General Epistles (including Hebrews)
** 22 chapters in Revelation
* This gives a total of 1,189 chapters (on average, 18 per book).
* Psalm 117, the shortest chapter, is also the middle chapter of the Bible, being the 595th Chapter.&lt;ref name=midbible&gt;[http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html The Center of the Bible] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828035123/http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html |date=August 28, 2005 }} at BreakTheChain.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Psalm|119|ESV}} is the longest chapter of the Bible.
* Five books are a single chapter: Obadiah, Philemon, 2 &amp; 3 John, Jude. In many printed editions, the chapter number is omitted for these books, and references just use the verse numbers.

===Verses===
* There are 23,145 verses in the Old Testament and 7,957 verses in the New Testament. This gives a total of 31,102 verses,&lt;ref name="blueletterbiblebooks"&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/study/misc/66books.cfm Study Resources: The Books of the Bible] at BlueLetterBible.org&lt;/ref&gt; which is an average of a little more than 26 verses per chapter.
* Contrary to popular belief, Psalm 118 does not contain the middle verse of the Bible. The King James Version has an even number of verses (31,102), with the two middle verses being {{bibleverse||Psalm|103:1–2|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblebelievers.com/believers-org/kjv-stats.html King James Bible Statistics] at BibleBelievers.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|John|11:35|NASB}} ("[[Jesus wept]]") is the shortest verse in most English translations. Some translations — including the New International Version, New Living Translation, New Life Version, Holman Christian Standard Bible and New International Reader's Version — render {{bibleverse||Job|3:2|HE}} as "He said". However, that is a translators' condensation of the Hebrew which literally translated is: "And Job answered and said."
&lt;!-- non English stats --&gt;
* The shortest verse in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] is {{bibleverse||Luke|20:30|NASB}} ("και ο δευτερος", "And the second") with twelve letters, according to the [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]] text. In the [[Textus Receptus]], the shortest verse is {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:16|NASB}} ("παντοτε χαιρετε", "Rejoice always") with fourteen letters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=5585 First Thessalonians 5:12–28], [[John Walvoord]] at Bible.org&lt;/ref&gt; since [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]]' rendering of Luke 20:30 includes some additional words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/LXX_WH-IGNT-KJV/Luke%2020:30 Luke 20:30 και ο δευτερος – and the second] with interlinear Greek-English and KJV&lt;br&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2020:30&amp;version=TR1550;WHNU Luke 20:30], in the 1550 [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]] New Testament and the 1881 [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott-Hort]] New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|Isaiah|10:8|ESV}} ("''Dicet enim''") is the shortest verse in the Latin [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=27&amp;c=10 Isaias 10] at LatinVulgate.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Esther|8:9|ESV}} is the longest verse in the Masoretic Text. The discovery of several manuscripts at [[Qumran]] (in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]) has reopened what is considered the most original text of 1 Samuel 11; if one believes that those manuscripts better preserve the text, several verses in 1 Samuel 11 surpass Esther 8:9 in length.

A '''circular reference''' is a series of [[reference]]s where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.
[[File:Circular Reference.svg|thumb|Circular reference (in red)]]

==In language==
A circular reference is not to be confused with the logical fallacy of a [[circular argument]].  Although a circular reference will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a circular reference is of no use.  Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a circular reference since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful reference.  Sentences containing circular references can still be meaningful;

:''Her brother gave her a kitten; his sister thanked him for it.''

is circular but not without meaning.  Indeed, it can be argued that self-reference is a necessary consequence of Aristotle's [[Law of non-contradiction]], a fundamental philosophical [[axiom]].  In this view, without self-reference, [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] become impossible, or at least, lack usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry A. Osborn]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fvJTwwCSy8UC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''The future of foreign language education in the United States''], pp.31-33, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|0-89789-719-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fiengo&gt;Robert Fiengo, Robert May, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V77kaAVpU0UC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''Indices and identity''], pp.59-62, MIT Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-262-56076-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer programming==
{{For|circular references between objects or resources|Reference counting}}

Circular references can appear in [[computer programming]] when one piece of code requires the result from another, but that code needs the result from the first. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Function A will show the time the sun last set based on the current date, which it can obtain by calling Function B. Function B will calculate the date based on the number of times the moon has orbited the earth since the last time Function B was called.  So, Function B asks Function C just how many times that is.  Function C doesn't know, but can figure it out by calling Function A to get the time the sun last set.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The entire set of functions is now worthless because none of them can return any useful information whatsoever.  This leads to what is technically known as a [[livelock]].  It also appears in [[spreadsheet]]s when two cells require each other's result.  For example, if the value in Cell A1 is to be obtained by adding 5 to the value in Cell B1, and the value in Cell B1 is to be obtained by adding 3 to the value in Cell A1, no values can be computed.  (Even if the specifications are A1:=B1+5 and B1:=A1-5, there is still a circular reference.  It doesn't help that, for instance, A1=3 and B1=-2 would satisfy both formulae, as there are infinitely many other possible values of A1 and B1 that can satisfy both instances.)

A circular reference represents a big problem in computing.

In ISO Standard SQL circular integrity constraints are implicitly supported within a single table. Between multiple tables circular constraints (e.g. foreign keys) are permitted by defining the constraints as deferrable (See [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html CREATE TABLE] for PostgreSQL and [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/clauses002.htm#i1015767 DEFERRABLE Constraint Examples] for Oracle). In that case the constraint is checked at the end of the transaction not at the time the DML statement is executed. To update a circular reference two statements can be issued in a single transaction that will satisfy both references once the transaction is committed.

A distinction should be made with processes containing a circular reference between those that are incomputable and those that are an iterative calculation with a final output.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30904">'''Comparative advertising''' or '''advertising war''' is an [[advertisement]] in which a particular product, or service, specifically mentions a competitor by name for the express purpose of showing why the competitor is inferior to the product naming it.&lt;ref name=chem&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Yuxin|last2=Joshi|first2=Yogesh V.|last3=Raju|first3=Jagmohan S.|last4=Zhang|first4=Z.

Barry &amp; R.L. Tremblay, “Comparative advertising: perspectives and issues”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1975, pp. 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

This should not be confused with [[parody advertisement]]s, where a fictional product is being advertised for the purpose of poking fun at the particular advertisement, nor should it be confused with the use of a coined brand name for the purpose of comparing the product  without actually naming an actual competitor.  ("[[Wikipedia]] tastes better and is less filling than the [[Encyclopedia Galactica]].")

In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) defined comparative advertising as “advertisement that compares alternative brands on objectively measurable attributes or price, and identifies the alternative brand by name, illustration or other distinctive information.”&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission Commercial Practice Rule 16 CFR §14.15 n 1 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was used in the case [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette Australia Pty Ltd]] v [[Energizer Holdings|Energizer Australia Pty Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;(2002) 193 ALR 629&lt;/ref&gt;   Similarly, the [[Law Council of Australia]] recently suggested that comparative advertising refers to “advertising which include reference to a competitor’s trademark in a way which does not impute proprietorship in the mark to the advertiser.”&lt;ref&gt;P. Armitage in M.A. Murphy, “Legal aspects of comparative advertising and a strategy for its use”,
Queensland University of Technology law journal, Vol. 12, 1996, pp. 41-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative advertisements could be either indirectly or directly comparative, positive or negative, and seeks “to associate or differentiate the two competing brands”.&lt;ref&gt;B. Mills, “Comparative advertising: should it be allowed?”, European Intellectual Property Review, Vol. 17, No. 9, 1995, pp. 417-430.&lt;/ref&gt; Different countries apply differing views regarding the laws on comparative advertising.

==History==
The earliest court case concerning comparative advertising dates back to 1910 in the United States – Saxlehner v Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;16 US 375, 30 S.Ct. 298, 54 L.ED 525 (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Mills, “Comparative advertising: should it be allowed?”, European Intellectual Property Review, Vol. 17, No. 9, 1995, pp. 417-430.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1970s, comparative advertising was deemed unfeasible due to related risks. For instance, comparative advertising could invite misidentification of products, potential legal issues, and may even win public sympathy for their competitors as victims.

In 1972, the FTC began to encourage advertisers to make comparison with named competitors, with the broad, public welfare objective of creating more informative advertising.&lt;ref&gt;F. Beard, “Comparative advertising wars: an historical analysis of their causes and consequences”, Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010, pp. 270-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC argued that this form of advertising could also stimulate comparison shopping, encourage product improvement and innovation, and foster a positive competitive environment.&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Beck-Dudley &amp; T.G. Williams, “Legal and public policy implications for the future of comparative advertising: a look at U-Haul v Jartran”, Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing, Vol. 8, No. 1, 1989, pp. 124-142.&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have shown that while comparative advertisements had increased since 1960, the relative amount of comparative advertising is still small.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Jackson Jr., S.W. Brown &amp; R.R. Harmon, “Comparative magazine advertisements”, Journal of Advertising Research, Vol. 19, No. 6, 1979, pp.21-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

=== European Union ===
Prior to 1997, many European countries severely limited comparative claims as an advertising practice. For example, in [[Germany]] comparisons in advertising had since the 1930's&lt;ref&gt;Bundesgerichtshof, ''Hellegold,'' GRUR 1931, 1299 ff., 1300; the German Supreme Court based its decision on the two grounds, namely that no one should be required to tolerate being another’s promotional tool, and that comparative advertising effectively permitted the advertiser "judge their own case".

&lt;/ref&gt; been largely prohibited as an anti-competitive practice, with very limited exceptions for cases where the advertiser had a good reason for presenting a critical claim, and reference to a competitor was necessary in order to present that claim.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesgerichtshof, ''Tauchkühler'', GRUR 1970, 422 

&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, this only applied to ''critical'' claims - claims of equivalence were completely prohibited. A similar approach had been adopted in [[France]], where comparative advertising was commonly seen as disparaging of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Biolay, Publicité comparative, 902 Juris-classeur Concurrence Consommation 6 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legalisation of comparative advertising in France in 1992&lt;ref&gt;The Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court) had permitted comparative advertising since 1986, Cass. com., July 22, 1986. The principles set out by the Court were codified by Law 92-60 of 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;, opened the door to a general legalisation of comparative advertising through EU law, which had first been proposed by the [[European Commission]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Journal of the European Union'', No C 70, 21. 3. 1978, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the adoption of [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] 97/55/EC, which came into force in the year 2000. The relevant provisions are now contained in Directive 2006/114/EC.

This Directive sets out rules that comparative advertising must comply with in order to be considered permissible.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 4 of Directive 2006/114/EC&lt;/ref&gt; These include the requirements that the comparison concern goods and services that meet the same purpose, that it objectively compare the relevant characteristics of the products concerned and that it not cause confusion or denigrate the trademarks and other distinguishing signs of competitors. The Directive prohibits comparisons that take unfair advantage of the reputation of a competitor's distinguishing marks, or present goods or services as imitations of products covered by a protected trade mark or trade name. Additionally, any comparison aimed at promoting goods bearing a [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected designation of origin]] must refer exclusively to other goods bearing the same designation.&lt;ref&gt;The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has held that this does not preclude advertising promoting other types of goods from referring to goods with a designation of origin, as long as this does not result in a taking of unfair advantage; ''De Landtsheer Emmanuel SA v. Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne'', Case C-381/05.&lt;/ref&gt; Directive 2006/114/EC constitutes a total harmonisation of the rules on comparative advertising, meaning that the Member States are neither allowed to permit comparisons that breach the requirements of the Directive, nor prohibit ones that do.&lt;ref&gt;Article 8(1) Directive 2006/114/EC&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further, while trademark rights can in principle be used to prevent comparative advertising that makes unauthorised use of a competitor's trademark&lt;ref&gt;O2 Holdings Limited v Hutchison 3G UK Limited, Case C‑533/06, paragraph 36&lt;/ref&gt;, this is not the case where the comparative advertisement complies with all the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC.&lt;ref&gt;O2 Holdings Limited v Hutchison 3G UK Limited, Case C‑533/06, paragraph 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimate comparative advertising must therefore be seen as an exception to the exclusive rights of the trademark proprietor. However, the trademark proprietor can, thanks to the prohibition on taking unfair advantage of a trademark's reputation, oppose the use of their trademark where it is not aimed at distinguishing the products of the advertiser and trademark proprietor and to highlight their differences objectively&lt;ref&gt;Case C-381/05, ''De Landtsheer Emmanuel SA v. Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne'' at paragraph 69.&lt;/ref&gt;, but rather at riding on the coat-tails of that mark in order to benefit from its reputation.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Oréal and others v. Bellure'', Case C‑487/07, at paragraph 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements set out by the Directive have resulted in some controversy. This is particularly true of the ''per se'' prohibition on comparisons presenting goods and services as imitations of trademarked products. In this regard, EU law contrasts starkly with the US approach; the US courts have long held&lt;ref&gt;Smith v. Chanel, Inc., 402 F.2d 562 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; that traders are allowed to the trademarked names of products they have imitated in advertising. In contrast, in L'Oréal and others v. Bellure&lt;ref&gt;Case C‑487/07&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that smell-alike perfumes marketed through comparison lists breached this condition. This decision was criticised both by the English courts&lt;ref&gt;See comments of Lord Justice Jacob at paragraph 50 of ''L'Oréal and others v. Bellure and others'' [2010] EWCA Civ 535&lt;/ref&gt; and by scholars&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gangjee, Dev, and Robert Burrell. "Because You're Worth It: L'Oréal and the Prohibition on Free Riding." ''The Modern Law Review'' 73, no. 2 (2010): 282-95. &lt;/ref&gt;, who have considered that this places unjustified limits on advertising acts that are otherwise fully legal, such as copying that does not infringe intellectual property rights. 

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, most of the use of competitor’s registered trademark in a comparative advertisement was an infringement of the registration up till the end of 1994. However, the laws on comparative advertising were harmonized in 2000. The current rules on comparative advertising are regulated by a series of EU Directives. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1276/contents/made The Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations 2008] implements provisions of Directive (EC) 2006/114 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;M, Peitz &amp; F, Barigozzi, “[http://www2.dse.unibo.it/wp/524.pdf Comparative Advertising and Competition Policy]”, School of Business Administration, Working Paper 19/2004, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the classic cases of comparative advertising in the UK was the [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-533/06 O2 v Hutchison case]. The [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ)  held that there could have been a trademark infringement when a comparative advertiser used the registered trademark for the advertiser’s own goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;P. England, “Advocate General says comparative advertising is not a matter of trade mark law”, Journal of Intellectual Property Law &amp; Practice, Vol.3, No. 5, 2008, pp.284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also held that a trademark proprietor could not prevent a competitor’s use of a sign similar or identical to his mark in a comparative advertisement, which satisfies all the conditions of the Comparative Advertising Directive. If the Advocate General's decision in the O2 case were followed by the ECJ, competitors will not be able to use trademark legislation either to prevent a comparative advertisement through an injunction or to charge in respect of its use. Conversely, in British Airways plc v Ryanair Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[2001] ETMR 235&lt;/ref&gt; a lenient approach was adopted by the UK courts. The use of competitors’ trademarks was no longer restricted for businesses competing within an industry, provided that compliance of the conditions set out in the legislation were performed. This meant that businesses are able to use the trademarks of other companies and trade names to distinguish the relative merits of their own products and services over those of their competitors.&lt;ref&gt;“Use of Competitors’ Trade Marks and Comparative Advertising in the United Kingdom and Europe”, Gillhams Solicitors and Lawyers 2008,  http://www.gillhams.com/articles/389.cfm, viewed 1 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The FTC and the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (NAD), govern the laws of comparative advertising in the United States including the treatment of comparative advertising claims. FTC stated that comparative advertising could benefit consumers and encourages comparative advertising, provided that the comparisons are “clearly identified, truthful, and non-deceptive”.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Villafranco, “Devoted to Intellectual Property Litigation &amp; Enforcement”, Woltens Kluwer Law &amp; Business, Aspen Publishers, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2010, http://www.kelleydrye.com/publications/articles/1335/_res/id=Files/index=0/Villafranco_Law%20of%20Comparative%20Advertising%20in%20the%20US_010210.pdf, viewed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although comparative advertising is encouraged, NAD has stated “claims that expressly or implicitly disparage a competing product should be held to the highest level of scrutiny in order to ensure that they are truthful, accurate, and narrowly drawn.”&lt;ref&gt;Sherwin-Williams Company, Report # 3988 ( NAD/CARU Case Reports December 2002),  citing  AT&amp;T Broadband, Report # 3914 ( NAD/CARU Case Reports  June 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Another major law is the trademark protective [[Lanham Act]], which states that one could incur liability when the message of the comparative advertisement is untrue or uncertain, but has the intention to deceive consumers through the implied message conveyed.

===Australia===
In Australia, no specific law governs comparative advertising although certain cases regarding this matter have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Matthew Anthony. "Legal aspects of comparative advertising and a strategy for its use." Queensland University of Technology Law Journal 12 (1996): 41-59. LegalTrac. Web. 2 Sep. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative advertising that is truthful, and does not lead to confusion is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Guidebook to Australian Trade Marks Law and Practice (2nd ed) (Sydney CCH, Australia, 1985) p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, Australian advertisers should make sure that the following are complied when exercising comparative advertising to avoid breaches regarding misleading advertising under Australia Consumer Law:&lt;ref&gt;Advertising and selling, Commonwealth of Australia, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Product compared should be like products as per HCF Australia Ltd v Switzerland Australia Health Fund Pty Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[1988] ATPR 40-846&lt;/ref&gt; or else comparison must be made clearly to consumers as per Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd;&lt;ref&gt;[2002] FCAFC 223&lt;/ref&gt;
# Test results are presented as it is as per Makita v Black &amp; Decker;&lt;ref&gt;[1995] ATPR 41-030&lt;/ref&gt;
# Test used are appropriate and conducted according to industry guidelines as per Duracell Australia Pty Ltd v Union Carbide Australia Ltd;&lt;ref&gt;[1988] ATPR 40-918&lt;/ref&gt; and
# Mock up test results truly reflects how is product functioning in real life as per Hoover (Australia) Pty Ltd v Email Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[1991] ATPR 41-149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Clarke, B. Sweeney &amp; Mark Bender, Marketing and The Law, 4th edn, LexisNexis Butterworths, New South Wales, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The law in Hong Kong regarding comparative advertising is the law that existed in the UK prior to the enactment of the UK Act 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Pendleton, Garland and Margolis, The Law of Intellectual and Industrial Property in Hong Kong (Hong Kong: Butterworths, 1994) pp 210-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong has no legislation exclusively intended at limiting false or misleading advertisements. Still, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap 362) bans the use of false trade descriptions in advertisements. The tort of trade libel also exists to deal with false or misleading advertisements designed to injure the competitor.&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Council may have the authority to publish information with a perspective to amending false or misleading advertisements,&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Council Ordinance, Cap 216, ss 4(1)(a) and 5(2)(d).&lt;/ref&gt; while the  Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies of Hong Kong have the authority to take action against members who organize advertisements that are inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Tackaberry, Paul. "Comparative advertising in Hong Kong: denigration and competition." Asia Pacific Law Review 5.1 (1996): 77. LegalTrac. Web. 2 Sep. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
In Argentina, there is no specific statute dealing with comparative advertising (so it is not forbidden), but there are clear jurisprudential rules based on unfair competition law.  If in some manner an advertisement is proven to be unfair or exceeds ethical standards by hiding the truth or omitting some essential aspect of the comparison, it is probable that an injunction will be granted and that the plaintiff will be able to obtain a final decision declaring the advertising illegal.

Numerous cases follow international precedent in referring to the requirements of the  [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997L0055:en:NOT European Union Directive on comparative advertising].  By following these criteria, Argentine courts have developed standards very similar to European regulation.  It is as if the judges wanted to validate the law created by the Courts with an external source.  Similar conclusions reached elsewhere indicate the existence of universally accepted principles that accept that comparing products in commercial advertisements should be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;Palazzi, Pablo. "Comparative Advertising in Argentine Law" Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal, Vol. 22, No. 659, 2012. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2122583&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the {{cite web |url = http://www.conar.org.br/pdf/brazilian-advertising-self.pdf |title = Brazilian Advertising Self-Regulation Code }} allow comparative advertising with certain restrictions. Its primary purpose shall be the clarification or consumer’s protection; it shall have as basic principle the objectiveness of the comparison since subjective data, psychological or emotionally based data does not constitute a valid comparison basis for consumers;  the purposed or implemented comparison shall be capable of being supported byevidence; in the case of consumption goods, the comparison shall be made with models manufactured in the same year and no comparison shall be made between products manufactured in different years, unless it is only a reference to show evolution, in which case the evolution shall be clearly demonstrated; there shall be no confusion between the products and competitor’s brands; there shall be no unfair competition, denigration of the product’s image or another company’s product; and there shall be no unreasonable use of the corporate image or goodwill of third parties.

Likewise, the majority of the Brazilian authors is inclined to say that its legitimacy depends to meet certain requirements, which, in general, would be stipulated by Article 3a of Directive 84/450/EEC &lt;ref&gt;DURIGAN, P. L. Publicidade comparativa: informação persuasiva e concorrência. pg. 248 http://www.paulo.durigan.com.br/artigos/publicidadecomparativa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In an early Mercosur's rules through Resolution 126/96.

==Effectiveness==
Comparative advertising has been increasingly implemented through the years, and the types of comparative advertising range from comparing a single attribute dimension, comparing an attribute unique to the target and absent in the referent and comparisons involving attributes unique to both brands.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zhang, F.R. Kardes &amp; M.L Cronley, “Comparative Advertising: Effects of Structural Alignability on Target Brand Evaluations”, Journal of Consumer Psychology, Vol. 12, No. 4, 2002, pp. 303-311.&lt;/ref&gt; The contributing factors to the effectiveness of comparative advertising include believability,&lt;ref&gt;T.E Barry &amp; R.L Tremblay, “Comparative Advertising: Perspectives and Issues”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1975, pp. 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the extent a consumer can rely on the information provided in comparative advertisements, the level of involvement,&lt;ref&gt;I. Soscia, S. Girolamo &amp; B. Busacca, “The Effect of Comparative Advertising on Consumer Perceptions: Similarity or Differentiation?”, Journal of Business and Psychology, Vol. 25, No. 1,  2009, pp. 109-118.&lt;/ref&gt; and the convenience in evaluation,&lt;ref&gt;K.E. James &amp; P.J. Hensel, “Negative Advertising: The Malicious Strain of Comparative Advertising”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 20, No. 2, 1991, pp. 53-69.&lt;/ref&gt; provided by spoon feeding the consumer with information that does not require extra effort in recall.&lt;ref&gt;A. Chattopadhyay, “When Does Comparative Advertising Influence Brand Attitude? The Role of Delay and Market Position”, Psychology &amp; Marketing, Vol. 15, No. 5, 1998, pp. 461-475.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative advertising is generally coupled with negativity, as evidenced by early industry condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;F. Beard, “Comparative Advertising Wars: An Historical Analysis of Their Causes and Consequences”, Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010, pp. 270-286.&lt;/ref&gt; Stating reasons such as participation in comparative advertising damaged the honour and credibility of advertising. Studies have suggested that negative information can be stored more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Sorescu &amp; B.D. Gelb, “ Negative Comparative Advertising: Evidence Favoring Fine-Tuning”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 29, No. 4, 2000, pp. 25-40.&lt;/ref&gt; thus generating the impact that any advertisement is purposed for, and more importantly, strong recall.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Nye, M.S. Roth &amp; T.A. Shimp, “Comparative Advertising in Markets Where Brands and Comparative Advertising are Novel”, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol. 39, 2008, pp. 851-863.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, such negativity can either be transferred directly to the brand and the consumer’s impression of the brand, various studies through the years have proven that comparative advertising has been responded to negatively.&lt;ref&gt;F. Beard, “Comparative Advertising Wars: An Historical Analysis of Their Causes and Consequences”, Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010, pp. 270-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Comparative advertising has been used effectively by companies like The National Australia Bank (NAB), and its “break up” campaign has made such an impact it has won an award from Cannes, and a substantial increase in its consumer interest.&lt;ref&gt;ArtsHub ,“Breakup Campaign Wins Cannes Lions”, http://www.artshub.com.au/au/news-article/news/arts/breakup-campaign-wins-cannes-lions-184492, viewed 30 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally acclaimed Apple Inc. has effectively utilized its Mac vs PC advertisements as part of its marketing efforts to increase its market share over the years. Such companies prove the academic view that comparative advertising is more successful when used by established brands,&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Nye, M.S. Roth &amp; T.A. Shimp, “Comparative Advertising in Markets Where Brands and Comparative Advertising are Novel”, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol. 39, 2008, pp. 851-863.&lt;/ref&gt; justified by the credibility and attention an established brand brings. Other famous examples include L’Oreal SA v Bellure NV&lt;ref&gt;[2010] R.P.C. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and Coca Cola v Pepsi.&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Petty &amp; P.M. Spink, “Comparative advertising law in the European Community: Will the proposed directive harmonize across the Atlantic?”, Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing, Vol.14, Issue 2, 1995, pp. 310-317.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative advertising has to be executed with caution and deep consideration for the targeted markets as the novelty of the concept affects the effectiveness of the stipulated campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Nye, M.S. Roth &amp; T.A. Shimp, “Comparative Advertising in Markets Where Brands and Comparative Advertising are Novel”, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol. 39, 2008, pp. 851-863.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, during what has been referred to as the [[cola wars]], [[soft-drink]] manufacturer [[Pepsi]] ran a series of advertisements where people, caught on hidden camera, in a blind taste test, chose Pepsi over rival [[Coca-Cola]].

[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|250px|thumbtime=3|"Daisy" advertisement]]
The use of comparative advertising has been well established in political campaigns, where typically one candidate will run ads where the record of the other candidate is displayed, for the purpose of disparaging the other candidate.  The most famous of these type ads, which only ran once on TV, consisted of a child picking daisies in a field, while a voice which sounded like [[Barry Goldwater]] performed a countdown to zero before the launch of a nuclear weapon which explodes in a mushroom cloud.  The ad, "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]", was produced by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s campaign in an attempt to prevent Goldwater from either winning the nomination of his party or being selected.

Another example took place throughout the late 1980s between the bitter rivals Nintendo and Sega. "[[Genesis does what Nintendon't]]" immediately became a [[catchphrase]] following the release of the Sega Genesis (known as Mega Drive in PAL countries).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1347">The '''comparative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''comp'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]] used in languages such as [[Mari language|Mari]] and [[Chechen language|Chechen]] to mark a likeness to something. 

It is not to be confused with the [[comparison (grammar)|comparative degree]], a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]].

In Mari, the comparative case is marked with the suffix -ла ('-la')  For example, if something were to taste like fish (кол - 'kol'), the form used would be колла - 'kolla'). It is also used in regard to languages, when denoting the language a person is speaking, writing, or hearing. Then, however, the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case. Usually, the suffix is not stressed. When it is used with languages, however, it is stressed.

In Chechen, it is marked with the suffix ''-l''. For example, ''sha'' is 'ice', ''shiila'' is 'cold', and ''shal shiila'' is 'cold as ice'.

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]], and is sometimes seen as more general than, or similar to, [[comparative psychology]].
From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

In order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|pmid=26302412|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{neuropsychology}}
'''Comparative neuropsychology''' refers to an approach used for understanding human [[brain]] functions. It involves the direct evaluation of clinical neurological populations by employing experimental methods originally developed for use with nonhuman animals.

Over many decades of animal research, methods were perfected to study the effects of well-defined brain [[lesion]]s on specific behaviors, and later the tasks were modified for human use.  Generally the modifications involve changing the reward from food to money, but standard administration of the tasks in humans still involves minimal instructions, thus necessitating a degree of [[procedural memory|procedural learning]] in human and nonhuman animals alike.

Currently, comparative neuropsychology is used with neurological patients to link specific deficits with localized areas of the brain.

The comparative neuropsychological approach employs simple tasks that can be mastered without relying upon language skills.  Precisely because these simple paradigms do not require linguistic strategies for solution, they are especially useful for working with patients whose language skills are compromised, or whose cognitive skills may be minimal.

Comparative neuropsychology contrasts with the traditional approach of using tasks that rely upon linguistic skills, and that were designed to study human cognition.  Because important ambiguities about its heuristic value had not been addressed empirically, only recently has comparative neuropsychology become popular for implementation with [[brain damage|brain-damaged]] patients.

Within the past decade, comparative neuropsychology has had prevalent use as a framework for comparing and contrasting the performances of disparate neurobehavioral populations on similar tasks.

==History==

Comparative neuropsychology involves the study of brain-behavior relationships by applying experimental paradigms, used extensively in animal laboratories, for testing human clinical populations.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oscar-Berman|first1=M|title=A comparative neuropsychological approach to alcoholism and the brain.|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism Supplement|date=1994|volume=2|pages=281–9|pmid=8974348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular paradigms include delayed reaction tasks, discrimination and reversal learning tasks, and matching- and nonmatching-to-sample.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; These tasks are used to test animals and relate them to human brain functioning. Such tasks were perfected on experimental animals having well defined brain lesions, and adapted for human neurological patients.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; The comparative aspects of such approach resides in the analogy between animals with brain lesions and human patients with lesions in homologous areas of the brain. One example is represented by the comparison between the brain of laboratory animals (primarily non human primates and mice) with the one of people with damages resulting from alcohol abuse.

==George Ettlinger==

George Ettlinger was one of the few who actively combined human and animal research, and he did so consistently throughout his scientific career.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, A. D. (1998). Introduction: Comparative Neuropsychology. Chicago: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger work focused on the importance of the inferior temporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning and memory in macaque monkeys,&lt;ref name="cowey"&gt;Cowey, A., Dean, P., &amp; Weiskrantz, L. (1998). Ettlinger at Bay: can visual agnosia be explained by low-level visual impairments? Chicago: Oxford University Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the importance of ventral temporal lobe in vision. Ettinger animals models carried inferotemporal or latero-ventral prestriate [[Ablative brain surgery|ablation]]. In 1966 George Ettlinger, together with the psychologist [[Colin Blakemore]] and the neurosurgeon Murray Falconer, described the results of a study on correlation between pre-operative intelligence and the severity of mesial temporal sclerosis in temporal lobe specimens excised to treat intractable epilepsy.&lt;ref name="oxbury" /&gt; Such study It is known as a forerunner of what has become one of the potentially most interesting techniques for exploring the relationship between certain aspects of human memory and temporal lobe structures.&lt;ref name="oxbury"&gt;Oxbury, J. M., &amp; Oxbury, S. (1998). Memory and the human temporal lobes. Chicago: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authors have carried out comparisons of [[Nazism]] and [[Stalinism]], in which they have considered the similarities and differences of the two ideologies and [[political systems]], what relationship existed between the two regimes, and why both of them came to prominence at the same time. During the 20th century, the comparison of [[Stalinism]] and [[Nazism]] was made on the topics of [[totalitarianism]], ideology, and [[personality cult]]. Both regimes were seen in contrast to the liberal West, with an emphasis on the similarities between the two.&lt;ref name="Geyer2"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[political scientist]]s [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Carl Friedrich]] and historian [[Robert Conquest]] were prominent advocates of applying the "totalitarian" concept to compare Nazism and Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Geyer, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The various authors are listed in chronological order, by the date of publication of the earliest work cited in their section. --&gt;
== Hannah Arendt==
[[File:Hannah arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hannah Arendt]] was one of the first scholars to propose that the regimes of Hitler and Stalin could be grouped in the same political category.]]
===The origins of totalitarianism===
One of the first scholars to publish a comparative study of Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union was [[Hannah Arendt]]. In her 1951 work, ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Arendt puts forward the idea of [[totalitarianism]] as a distinct type of political movement and form of government, which “differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Arendt distinguishes between a totalitarian movement (such as a political party with totalitarian aims) and a totalitarian government. Not all totalitarian movements succeed in creating totalitarian governments once they gain power. In Arendt’s view, although many totalitarian movements existed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, only the governments of Stalin and Hitler succeeded in fully implementing their totalitarian aims.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arendt traced the origin of totalitarian movements to the nineteenth century, focusing especially on [[antisemitism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. She emphasized the connection between the rise of European [[nation-state]]s and the growth of antisemitism, which was due to the fact that the Jews represented an “inter-European, non-national element in a world of growing or existing nations.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] abounded, and the Jews were accused of being part of various international schemes to ruin European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Small antisemitic political parties formed in response to this perceived Jewish threat, and, according to Arendt, these were the first political organizations in Europe that claimed to represent the interests of the whole nation as opposed to the interests of a class or other social group.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The later totalitarian movements would copy or inherit this claim to speak for the whole nation, with the implication that any opposition to them constituted treason.

European [[New Imperialism|imperialism of the nineteenth century]] also paved the way for totalitarianism, by legitimizing the concept of endless expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; After Europeans had engaged in imperialist expansion on other continents, political movements developed which aimed to copy the methods of imperialism on the European continent itself. Arendt refers specifically to the “[[Pan-nationalism|pan-movements]]” of [[pan-Germanism]] and [[pan-Slavism]], which promised continental empires to nations that had little hope of overseas expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arendt, “Nazism and Bolshevism owe more to Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism (respectively) than to any other ideology or political movement.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment, propaganda and indoctrination===
Arendt argues that both the Nazi and Bolshevik movements “recruited their members from [a] mass of apparently indifferent people whom all other parties had given up,”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; and who “had reason to be equally hostile to all parties.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, totalitarian movements did not need to use debate or persuasion, and did not need to refute the arguments of the other parties. Their target audience did not have to be persuaded to despise the other parties or the democratic system, because it consisted of people who already despised mainstream politics. As a result, totalitarian movements were free to use violence and terror against their opponents without fear that this might alienate their own supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of arguing against their opponents, they adopted [[determinism|deterministic]] views of human behavior and presented opposing ideas as “originating in deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual and therefore beyond the power of reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular, during the years before their rise to power, engaged in “killing small socialist functionaries or influential members of opposing parties” both as a means to intimidate opponents and as a means of demonstrating to their supporters that they were a party of action, “different from the ‘idle talkers’ of other parties.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian governments make extensive use of propaganda, and are often characterized by having a strong distinction between what they tell their own supporters and the propaganda they produce for others. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt distinguishes these two categories as "indoctrination" and "propaganda". Indoctrination consists of the message that a totalitarian government promotes internally, to the members of the ruling party and that segment of the population which supports the government. Propaganda consists of the message that a totalitarian government seeks to promote in the outside world, and also among those parts of its own society which may not support the government. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, “the necessities for propaganda are always dictated by the outside world,” while the opportunities for indoctrination depend on “the totalitarian governments’ isolation and security from outside interference.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of indoctrination used by the Soviets and the Nazis was characterized by claims of “scientific” truth, and appeals to “objective laws of nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements took a [[determinism|deterministic]] view of human society and claimed that their ideologies were based on scientific discoveries regarding race (in the case of the Nazis) or the forces governing human history (in the case of the Soviets). Arendt identifies this as being in certain ways similar to modern [[advertising]], in which companies claim that scientific research shows their products to be superior, but more generally she argues that it is an extreme version of “that obsession with science which has characterized the Western world since the rise of mathematics and physics in the sixteenth century.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; By their use of [[pseudoscience]] as the main justification for their actions, Nazism and Stalinism are distinguished from earlier historical despotic regimes, who appealed instead to [[religion]] or sometimes did not try to justify themselves at all. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments did not merely use these appeals to supposed scientific laws as propaganda to manipulate others. Rather, totalitarian leaders like Hitler and Stalin genuinely believed that they were acting in accordance with immutable natural laws, to such an extent that they were willing to sacrifice the self-interest of their regimes for the sake of enacting those supposed laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Nazis treated the inhabitants of occupied territories with extreme brutality and planned to depopulate Eastern Europe in order to make way for colonists from the German “[[herrenvolk|master race]],” despite the fact that this actively harmed their war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin repeatedly [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purged the Communist Party]] of people who deviated even slightly from the party line, even when this weakened the party or the Soviet government, because he believed that they represented the interests of “dying classes” and their demise was historically inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Leader===
Arendt also identifies the central importance of an all-powerful leader in totalitarian movements. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; As in other areas, she distinguishes between totalitarian leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and non-totalitarian dictators or autocratic leaders. The totalitarian leader does not rise to power by personally using violence or through any special organizational skills, but rather by controlling appointments of personnel within the party, so that all other prominent party members owe their positions to him.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; With loyalty to the leader becoming the primary criterion for promotion, ambitious party members compete with each other in trying to express their loyalty, and a [[cult of personality]] develops around the leader. Even when the leader is not particularly competent and the members of his inner circle are aware of his deficiencies, they remain committed to him out of fear that without him the entire power structure would collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "enemies"===
Once in power, according to Arendt, totalitarian movements face a major dilemma: they built their support on the basis of anger against the status quo and on impossible or dishonest promises, but now they have become the new status quo and are expected to carry out their promises.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with this problem by engaging in a constant struggle against external and internal enemies, real or imagined, so as to enable them to say that, in a sense, they have not yet gained the power they need to fulfill their promises. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments must be constantly fighting enemies in order to survive. This explains their apparently irrational behavior, for example when Hitler continued to make territorial demands even after he was offered everything he asked for in the [[Munich Agreement]], or when Stalin unleashed the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] despite the fact that he faced no significant internal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration camps===
Arendt points out the widespread use of [[concentration camp]]s by totalitarian governments, arguing that they are the most important manifestation of the need to find enemies to fight against, and are therefore “more essential to the preservation of the regime’s power than any of its other institutions.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Although forced labor was commonly imposed on inmates of concentration camps, Arendt argues that their primary purpose was not any kind of material gain for the regime: “The only permanent economic function of the camps has been the financing of their own supervisory apparatus; thus from the economic point of view the concentration camps exist mostly for their own sake.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular carried this to the point of “open anti-utility,” by expending large sums of money, resources and manpower – during a war – for the purpose of building and staffing [[extermination camps]] and transporting people to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; This sets apart the concentration camps of totalitarian regimes from older human institutions that bear some similarity to them, such as [[slavery]].  Slaves were abused and killed for the sake of profit; concentration camp inmates were abused and killed because a totalitarian government needed to justify its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Arendt points out that concentration camps under both Hitler and Stalin included large numbers of inmates who were innocent of any crime – not only in the ordinary sense of the word, but even by the standards of the regimes themselves. That is to say, most of the inmates had not actually committed any action against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

===The future of totalitarian systems===
Throughout her analysis, Arendt emphasized the modernity and novelty of the governmental structures set up by Stalin and Hitler, arguing that they represented “an entirely new form of government” which is likely to manifest itself again in various other forms in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; She also cautioned against the belief that future totalitarian movements would necessarily share the ideological foundations of Nazism or Stalinism, writing that “all ideologies contain totalitarian elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski ==

===Totalitarian systems and autocracies===
The totalitarian paradigm in the comparative study of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was further developed by [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], who wrote extensively on this topic both individually and in collaboration. Similar to Hannah Arendt, they state that “totalitarian dictatorship is a new phenomenon; there has never been anything quite like it before.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski classify totalitarian dictatorship as a type of [[autocracy]], but argue that it is different in important ways from most other historical autocracies. In particular, it is distinguished by a reliance on modern technology and mass legitimation.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski apply the notion of totalitarian dictatorship not only to the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, but also to the USSR throughout its entire existence, as well as the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy and the [[People’s Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]].

Carl Friedrich noted that the “possibility of equating the dictatorship of Stalin in the Soviet Union and that of Hitler in Germany” has been a deeply controversial topic and a subject of debate almost from the beginning of those dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Various other aspects of the two regimes have also been the subject of intense scholarly debate, such as whether Nazi and Stalinist ideologies were genuinely believed and pursued by the respective governments, or whether the ideologies were merely convenient justifications for dictatorial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich himself argues in favor of the former view.

Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that Nazism and Stalinism are not only similar to each other, but also represent a continuation or a return to the tradition of European [[absolute monarchy]] on certain levels.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the absolute monarchies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the monarch ultimately held all decisional power, and was considered accountable only to God. In Stalinism and Nazism, the leader likewise held all real power, and was considered accountable only to various intangible entities such as “the people”, “the masses” or “the Volk.” Thus the common feature of autocracies – whether monarchical or totalitarian – is the concentration of power in the hands of a leader who cannot be held accountable by any legal mechanisms, and who is supposed to be the embodiment of the will of an abstract entity.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify other features common to all autocracies, such as “the oscillation between tight and loose control.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The regime alternates between periods of intense repression and periods of relative freedom, often represented by different leaders. This depends in part on the personal character of different leaders, but Friedrich and Brzezinski believe that there is also an underlying political cycle, in which rising discontent leads to increased repression up to the point at which the opposition is eliminated, then controls are relaxed until the next time that popular dissatisfaction begins to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, placing Stalinism and Nazism within the broader historical tradition of autocratic government, Friedrich and Brzezinski hold that “totalitarian dictatorship, in a sense, is the adaptation of autocracy to twentieth-century industrial society.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time, they insist that totalitarian dictatorship is a “''novel'' type of autocracy”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that twentieth century totalitarian regimes (such as those of Hitler and Stalin) had more in common with each other than with any other form of government, including historical autocracies of the past. Totalitarianism can only exist after the creation of modern technology, because such technology is essential for [[propaganda]], for surveillance of the population, and for the operation of a [[secret police]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when speaking of the differences and similarities between fascist and communist regimes, Friedrich and Brzezinski insist that the two kinds of totalitarian governments are “basically alike” but “not wholly alike” – they are more similar to each other than to other forms of government, but they are not the same.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major differences between them, Friedrich and Brzezinski identify in particular the fact that communists seek “the world revolution of the proletariat,” while fascists wish to “establish the imperial predominance of a particular nation or race.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five pillars of totalitarian systems===
In terms of the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, Friedrich lists five main aspects that they hold in common: First, an official ideology that is supposed to be followed by all members of society, at least passively, and which promises to serve as a perfect guide towards some ultimate goal. Second, a [[one-party state|single political party]], composed of the most enthusiastic supporters of the official ideology, representing an elite group within society (no more than 10 percent of the population), and organized along strictly regimented lines. Third, “a technologically conditioned near-complete monopoly of control of all means of effective armed combat” in the hands of the party or its representatives. Fourth, a similar monopoly held by the party over the mass media and all technological forms of communication. Fifth, “a system of terroristic police control” that is not only used to defend the regime against real enemies, but also to persecute various groups of people who are only suspected of being enemies or who may potentially become enemies in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Two first pillars of any totalitarian government, according to Friedrich and Brzezinski, are the dictator and the Party. The dictator, whether Stalin, Hitler or Mussolini, holds supreme power. Friedrich and Brzezinski explicitly reject the claim that the Party, or any other institution, could provide a significant counterweight to the power of the dictator in Nazism or Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The dictator needs the Party in order to be able to rule, so he may be careful not to make decisions that would go directly against the wishes of other leading Party members, but ultimate authority rests with him and not with them. Like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify the cult of personality surrounding the leader as an essential element of a totalitarian dictatorship, and reference Stalin’s personality cult in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw attention to the fact that Hitler and Stalin were expected to provide ideological direction for their governments and not merely practical leadership. Friedrich and Brzezinski write that “unlike military dictators in the past, but like certain types of primitive chieftains, the totalitarian dictator is both ruler and high priest.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, he not only governs, but also provides the principles on which his government is to be based. This is partly due to the way that totalitarian governments arise. They come about when a militant ideological movement seizes power, so the first leader of a totalitarian government is usually the ideologue who built the movement that seized power, and subsequent leaders try to emulate him.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dictator and his henchmen ====
The totalitarian dictator needs loyal lieutenants to carry out his orders faithfully and with a reasonable degree of efficiency. Friedrich and Brzezinski identify parallels between the men in Hitler and Stalin’s entourage, arguing that both dictators used similar people to perform similar tasks. Thus, for example, [[Martin Bormann]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] were both capable administrators and bureaucrats, while [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]] were ruthless secret police chiefs responsible for suppressing any potential challenge to the dictator’s power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hitler and Stalin promoted rivalry and distrust among their lieutenants so as to ensure that none of them would become powerful enough to challenge the dictator himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; This is the cause of an important weakness of the totalitarian regimes: the problem of succession. Friedrich points out that neither the Nazi nor the Stalinist government ever established any official line of succession or any mechanism to decide who would replace the dictator after his death. The dictator, being the venerated “father of the people,” was regarded as irreplaceable. There could never be any heir apparent, because such an heir would have been a threat to the power of the dictator while he was alive. Thus the dictator’s inevitable death would always leave behind a major power vacuum and cause a political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Nazi regime, since Hitler died mere days before the final defeat of Germany in the war, this never became a major issue. In the case of the USSR, Stalin’s death led to a prolonged power struggle.

====Totalitarian Party====
Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify key similarities between the Nazi and Stalinist political parties, which set them apart from other types of political parties. Both the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[CPSU]] under Stalin had very strict membership requirements and did not accept members on the basis of mere agreement with the Party’s ideology and goals. Rather, they strictly tested potential members, in a manner similar to exclusive clubs, and often engaged in political [[purge]]s of the membership, expelling large numbers of people from their ranks (and sometimes arresting and executing those expelled, such as in the [[Great Purge]] or the [[Night of the Long Knives]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the totalitarian party cultivates the idea that to be a member is a privilege which needs to be earned, and total obedience to the leader is required in order to maintain this privilege. While both Nazism and Stalinism required party members to display such total loyalty in practice, they differed in the way they dealt with it in theory. Nazism openly proclaimed the hierarchical ideal of absolute obedience to the [[Führer]] as one of its key ideological principles (the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''). Stalinism, meanwhile, denied that it did anything similar, and claimed instead to uphold democratic principles, with the Party Congress (made up of elected delegates) supposedly being the highest authority.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Stalinist elections typically featured only a single candidate, and the Party Congress met very rarely and simply approved Stalin’s decisions. Thus, regardless of the differences in their underlying ideological claims, the Nazi and Stalinist parties were organized in practice along similar lines, with a rigid hierarchy and centralized leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Each totalitarian party and dictator is supported by a specific totalitarian ideology. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue, in agreement with Arendt, that Nazi and Stalinist leaders really believed in their respective ideologies and did not merely use them as tools to gain power. Several major policies, such as the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Stalinist collectivization of agriculture]] or the [[Final Solution |Nazi “final solution”]], cannot be explained by anything other than a genuine commitment to achieve ideological goals, even at great cost.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The ideologies were different and their goals were different, but what they had in common was a [[utopian]] commitment to reshaping the world, and a determination to fight by any means necessary against a real or imagined enemy.  This stereotyped enemy could be described as “the fat rich Jew or the Jewish Bolshevik” for the Nazis, or “the war-mongering, atom-bomb-wielding American Wallstreeter” for the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideology and symbolism====
According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most important difference between Nazi and Stalinist ideology lies in the degree of universality involved. Stalinism, and communist ideology in general, is universal in its appeal and addresses itself to all the “[[Workers of the world, unite!|workers of the world]].” Nazism, on the other hand, and fascist ideology in general, can only address itself to one particular race or nation – the “[[master race]]” that is destined to dominate all others. Therefore, “in communism social justice appears to be the ultimate value, unless it be the classless society that is its essential condition; in fascism, the highest value is dominion, eventually world dominion, and the strong and pure nation-race is ''its'' essential condition, as seen by its ideology.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; This means that fascist or Nazi movements from different countries will be natural enemies, rather than natural allies, as they each seek to extend the dominion of their own nation at the expense of others.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski see this as a weakness inherent in fascist and Nazi ideology, while communist universalism is a source of ideological strength for Stalinism.

Friedrich and Brzezinski also draw attention to the symbols used by Nazis and Stalinists to represent themselves. The Soviet Union adopted the [[hammer and sickle]], a newly-created symbol, “invented by the leaders of the movement and pointing to the future.” Meanwhile, Nazi Germany used the [[swastika]], “a ritual symbol of uncertain origin, quite common in primitive societies.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one is trying to project itself as being oriented towards a radically new future, while the other is appealing to a mythical heroic past.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propaganda and terror====
Totalitarian dictatorships maintain themselves in power through the use of propaganda and terror, which Friedrich and Brzezinski believe to be closely connected. Terror may be enforced with arrests and executions of dissenters, but it can also take more subtle forms, such as the threat of losing one’s job, social stigma and defamation. “Terror” can refer to any widespread method used to intimidate people into submission as a matter of daily life. According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most effective terror is invisible to the people it affects. They simply develop a habit of acting in a conformist manner and not questioning authority, without necessarily being aware that this is what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, terror creates a society dominated by apparent consensus, where the vast majority of the population appears to support the government. Propaganda is then used to maintain this appearance of popular consent. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian propaganda is one of the features that distinguishes totalitarian regimes as modern forms of government and separates them from older autocracies, since a totalitarian government holds complete control over all means of communication (not only public communication such as the mass media, but also private communication such as letters and telephone calls, which are strictly monitored).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of propaganda were very similar in the Stalinist USSR and in Nazi Germany. Both [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Soviet propagandists sought to demonize their enemies and present a picture of a united people standing behind its leader to confront foreign threats. In both cases there was no attempt to convey complex ideological nuances to the masses, with the message being instead about a simplistic struggle between good and evil. Both Nazi and Stalinist regimes produced two very different sets of propaganda – one for internal consumption and one for potential sympathizers in other countries. And both regimes would sometimes radically change their propaganda line as they made peace with a former enemy or got into a war with a former ally.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, paradoxically, a totalitarian government’s complete control over communications renders that government highly misinformed. With no way for anyone to express criticism, the dictator has no way of knowing how much support he actually has among the general populace. With all government policies always declared successful in propaganda, officials are unable to determine what actually worked and what didn’t.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism suffered from this problem, especially during the war between them. As the war turned against Germany, there was growing opposition to Hitler’s rule, including within the ranks of the military, but Hitler was never aware of this until it was too late (see: [[20 July plot]]). In 1948, during the early days of the [[Berlin Blockade]], the Soviet leadership apparently believed that the population of [[West Berlin]] was sympathetic to Soviet Communism and that they would request to join the Soviet zone.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; Given enough time, the gap between real public opinion and what the totalitarian government believes about public opinion can grow so wide that the government is no longer able to even produce effective propaganda, because it does not know what the people actually think and so it does not know what to tell them. Friedrich and Brzezinski refer to this as the “ritualization of propaganda”: the totalitarian regime continues to produce propaganda as a political ritual, with little real impact on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrests, executions and concentration camps====
The totalitarian use of mass arrests, executions and concentration camps – also noted by Arendt – was analyzed at length by Friedrich and Brzezinski. They hold that “totalitarian terror maintains, in institutionalized form, the civil war that originally produced the totalitarian movement and by means of which the regime is able to proceed with its program, first of social disintegration and then of social reconstruction.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism saw themselves as engaging in a life-or-death struggle against implacable enemies. But to declare that the struggle had been won would have meant to declare that most of the totalitarian features of the government were no longer needed. A secret police force, for instance, has no reason to exist if there are no dangerous traitors who need to be found. Thus the struggle, or “civil war” against internal enemies, must be institutionalized and must continue indefinitely. In the Stalinist USSR, the repressive apparatus was eventually turned against members of the Communist Party itself in the Great Purge and the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] that accompanied it. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 187, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Nazism, by contrast, had a much shorter lifespan in power, and Nazi terror generally maintained an outward focus, with the extermination of the Jews always given top priority. The Nazis did not turn inward towards purging their own party except in a limited way on two occasions (the Night of the Long Knives and the aftermath of the 20 July plot). &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak of totalitarian terror was reached with the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. These ranged from [[labor camp]]s to [[extermination camp]]s, and they are described by Friedrich and Brzezinski as aiming to “eliminate all actual, potential, and imagined enemies of the regime.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; As the field of [[Holocaust studies]] was still in its early stages at the time of their writing, they do not describe the conditions in detail, but do refer to the camps as involving “extreme viciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; They also compare these camps with the Soviet [[Gulag]] system, and highlight the use of concentration camps as a method of punishment and execution by Nazi and Stalinist regimes alike. However, unlike Hannah Arendt, who held that the Gulag camps served no economic purpose, Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that they provided an important source of cheap labor for the Stalinist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany and Russia===
The comparative study of Nazism and Stalinism was carried further by other groups of scholars, such as [[Moshe Lewin]] and [[Ian Kershaw]] together with their collaborators. Writing after the [[dissolution of the USSR]], Lewin and Kershaw take a longer historical perspective and regard Nazism and Stalinism not so much as examples of a new type of society (like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski did), but more as historical “anomalies” – unusual deviations from the typical path of development that most industrial societies are expected to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task of comparing Nazism and Stalinism is, to them, a task of explaining why Germany and Russia (along with other countries) deviated from the historical norm. At the outset, Lewin and Kershaw identify similarities between the historical situations in Germany and Russia prior to the First World War and during that war. Both countries were ruled by authoritarian monarchies, who were under pressure to make concessions to popular demands. Both countries had “powerful bureaucracies and strong military traditions.” Both had “powerful landowning classes,” while also being in the process of rapid industrialization and modernization. And both countries had expansionist foreign policies with a particular interest in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw do not claim that these factors made Stalinism or Nazism inevitable, but rather that they help to explain why the Stalinist and Nazi regimes developed similar features.

===Similarities and differences of the systems===
Ian Kershaw  admitted that Stalinism and Nazism are comparable in “the nature and extent of their inhumanity,” but noted that the two regimes were different in a number of aspects&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw question the usefulness of grouping the Stalinist and Nazi regimes together under a “totalitarian” category, saying that it remains an open question whether the similarities between them are greater or smaller than the differences.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they criticize what they see as the ideologically-motivated attempt to determine which regime killed more people, saying that apologists of each regime are trying to defend their side by claiming the other was responsible for more deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personality cult====
Lewin and Kershaw place the [[cult of personality]] at the center of their comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, writing that both regimes “represented a new genre of political system centred upon the artificial construct of a leadership cult – the ‘heroic myth’ of the ‘great leader’, no longer a king or emperor but a ‘man of the people.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Stalinism, they emphasize its bureaucratic character, and its “merging of the most modern with the most archaic traits” by combining modern technology and the latest methods of administration and propaganda with the ancient practice of arbitrary rule by a single man.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They compare this with the [[Prussia]]n military tradition in Germany, which had been called “bureaucratic absolutism” in the eighteenth century, and which played a significant role in the organization of the Nazi state in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw agrees with Mommsen that there was a fundamental difference between Nazism and Stalinism regarding the importance of the leader. Stalinism had an absolute leader, but he was not essential. He could be replaced by another. Nazism, on the other hand, was a “classic charismatic leadership movement,” defined entirely by its leader. Stalinism had an ideology which existed independently of Stalin. But for Nazism, “Hitler ''was'' ideological orthodoxy” – Nazi ideals were by definition whatever Hitler said they were. In Stalinism, the bureaucratic apparatus was the foundation of the system, while in Nazism, the person of the leader was the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Lewin also focuses on the comparison between the personality cults of Hitler and Stalin, and their respective roles in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. He refers to them as the “Hitler myth” and the “Stalin myth,” and argues that they served different functions within their two regimes. The function of the “Hitler myth” was to legitimize Nazi rule. The function of the “Stalin myth” was to legitimize not Soviet rule itself, but Stalin’s leadership within the Party. Stalin’s personality cult existed precisely because Stalin knew that he was replaceable, and feared that he might be replaced, and so needed to bolster his authority as much as possible. While the “Hitler myth” was essential to Nazi Germany, the “Stalin myth” was essential only to Stalin, not to the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrinsic instability of totalitarian systems====
Together with fellow historian [[Hans Mommsen]], Lewin argues that the Stalinist and Nazi regimes featured an “intrinsic structural contradiction” which led to “inherent self-destructiveness”: they depended on a highly organized state bureaucracy which was trying to set up complex rules and procedures for every aspect of life, yet this bureaucracy was under the complete personal control of a despot who made policy decisions as he saw fit, routinely changing his mind on major issues, without any regard for the rules and institutions which his own bureaucracy had set up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The bureaucracy and the leader needed each other, but also undermined each other with their different priorities. Mommsen sees this as being a much greater problem in Nazi Germany than in Stalin’s Soviet Union, as the Nazis inherited large parts of the traditional German bureaucracy, while the Soviets largely built their own bureaucracy from the ground up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that many of the irrational features of the Nazi regime – such as wasting resources on exterminating undesirable populations instead of using those resources in the war effort – were caused by the dysfunction of the Nazi state rather than by fanatical commitment to Nazi ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the [[Führerprinzip]], all decisional power in the Nazi state ultimately rested with Hitler. But Hitler often issued only vague and general directives, forcing other Nazi leaders lower down in the hierarchy to guess what precisely the Führer wanted. This confusion produced competition between Nazi officials, as each of them attempted to prove that he was a more dedicated Nazi than his rivals, by engaging in ever more extreme policies. This competition to please Hitler was, according to Mommsen, the real cause of Nazi irrationality.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware of it, and deliberately encouraged it out of a “social-darwinist conviction that the best man would ultimately prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen argues that this represents a structural difference between the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. In spite of its purges, Stalin’s regime was more effective in building a stable bureaucracy, such that it was possible for the system to sustain itself and continue even without Stalin. The Nazi regime, on the other hand, was much more personalized and depended entirely on Hitler, being unable to build any lasting institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stalin and Hitler====
Kershaw also saw  major personal differences between Stalin and Hitler and their respective styles of rule. He describes Stalin as “a committee man, chief oligarch, man of the machine” and a “creature of his party,” who came to power only thanks to his party and his ability to manipulate the levers of power within that party.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler, by contrast, came to power based on his charisma and mass appeal, and in the Nazi regime it was the leader that created the party instead of the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kershaw, “Stalin was a highly interventionist dictator, sending a stream of letters and directives determining or interfering with policy,” while Hitler “was a non-interventionist dictator as far as government administration was concerned,” preferring to involve himself in military affairs and plans for conquest rather than the daily routine of government work, and giving only broad verbal instructions to his subordinates regarding civilian affairs, which they were expected to translate into policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although both regimes featured all-pervasive cults of personality, there was a qualitative difference between those cults. Stalin’s personality cult was “superimposed upon the Marxist-Leninist ideology and Communist Party,” and could be abandoned (or replaced with a personality cult around some other leader) without major changes to the regime. On the other hand, “the ‘Hitler myth’ was structurally indispensable to, in fact the very basis of, and scarcely distinguishable from, the Nazi Movement and its ''Weltanschauung''.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in the person of Adolf Hitler as the unique savior of the German nation was the very foundation of Nazism, to such an extent that Nazism found it impossible to even imagine a successor to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Kershaw’s analysis, Stalinism was a fundamentally bureaucratic system while Nazism was the embodiment of “charismatic authority” as described by [[Max Weber]]. Stalinism could exist without its leader. Nazism could not. &lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rousso, Werth, and Burrin ==
[[File:Nicolas Werth 04-2012.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Werth in 2012]]
The topic of comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism was also studied in the 1990s and 2000s by historians [[Henry Rousso]], [[Nicolas Werth]] and Philippe Burrin.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===The differences between Stalinism and Nazism===
Rousso defends the work of Carl Friedrich by pointing out that Friedrich himself had only said that Stalinism and Nazism were comparable, not that they were identical. Rousso also argues that the popularity of the concept of totalitarianism (the way that large numbers of people have come to routinely refer to certain governments as “totalitarian”) should be seen as evidence that the concept is useful, that it really describes a specific type of government which is different from other dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, Rousso notes that the concept of totalitarianism is descriptive rather than analytical: the regimes described as totalitarian do not have a common origin and did not arise in similar ways. Nazism is unique among totalitarian regimes in having taken power in “a country endowed with an advanced industrial economy and with a system of political democracy (and an even older political pluralism).” All other examples of totalitarianism (including the Stalinist regime) took power, according to Rousso, “in an agrarian economy, in a poor society without a tradition of political pluralism, not to mention democracy, and where diverse forms of tyranny had traditionally prevailed.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He sees this as a weakness of the concept of totalitarianism, because it merely describes the similarities between Stalinism and Nazism without dealing with the very different ways they came to power.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Rousso agrees with Hannah Arendt that “totalitarian regimes constitute something new in regard to classical tyranny, authoritarian regimes, or other forms of ancient and medieval dictatorships,” and he says that the main strength of the concept of totalitarianism is the way it highlights this inherent novelty of the regimes involved.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict between the dictator and bureaucracy===
Nicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin have worked together on comparative assessments of Stalinism and Nazism, with Werth covering the Stalinist regime and Burrin covering Nazi Germany. One of the topics they have studied is the question of how much power the dictator really held in the two regimes. Werth identifies two main [[historiography|historiographical]] approaches in the study of the Stalinist regime: Those who emphasize the power and control exercised by Joseph Stalin himself, attributing most of the actions of the Soviet government to deliberate plans and decisions made by him, and those who argue that Stalin had no pre-determined course of action in mind, that he was reacting to events as they unfolded, and that the Soviet bureaucracy had its own agenda which often differed from Stalin’s wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Werth regards these as two mistaken extremes, one making Stalin seem all-powerful, the other making him seem like a weak dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; But he believes that the competing perspectives are useful in drawing attention to the tension between two different forms of organization in the Stalinist USSR: an “administrative system of command,” bureaucratic and resistant to change but effective in running the Soviet state, and the strategy of “running the country in a crudely despotic way by Stalin and his small cadre of directors.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Werth agrees with Lewin that there was an inherent conflict between the priorities of the Soviet bureaucracy and Stalin’s accumulation of absolute power in his own hands. According to Werth, it was this unresolved and unstated conflict that led to the Great Purge and to the use of terror by Stalin’s regime against its own party and state cadres.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying similar issues with regard to the Nazi regime, Philippe Burrin draws attention to the debate between the “Intentionalist” and “Functionalist” schools of thought, which dealt with the question of whether the Nazi regime represented an extension of Hitler’s autocratic will, faithfully obeying his wishes, or whether it was an essentially chaotic and uncontrollable system that functioned on its own with little direct input from the Führer.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Like Kershaw and Lewin, Burrin says that the relationship between the leader and his party’s ideology was different in Nazism compared to Stalinism: “One can rightly state that Nazism cannot be dissociated from Hitlerism, something that is difficult to affirm for Bolshevism and Stalinism.” Unlike Stalin, who inherited an existing system with an existing ideology and presented himself as the heir to the Leninist political tradition, Hitler created both his movement and its ideology by himself, claiming to be “someone sent by Providence, a Messiah whom the German people had been expecting for centuries, even for two thousand years, as Heinrich Himmler enjoyed saying.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there could be no real conflict between the Party and the leader in Nazi Germany, because the Nazi Party’s entire reason for existence was to support and follow Hitler. However, there was a potential for division between the leader and the state bureaucracy, due to the way that Nazism came to power – as part of an alliance with traditional conservative elites, industrialists, and the army.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the USSR, Nazi Germany did not build its own state, but rather inherited the state machinery of the previous government. This provided the Nazis with an immediate supply of capable and experienced managers and military commanders, but on the other hand it also meant that the Nazi regime had to rely on the cooperation of people who had not been Nazis prior to Hitler’s rise to power, and whose loyalty was questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during the war, when Nazi Germany conquered large territories and had to create Nazi administrations for them, that brand new Nazi bureaucracies were created without any input or participation from traditional German elites. This produced a surprising difference between Nazism and Stalinism: When the Stalinist USSR conquered territory, it created smaller copies of itself and installed them as the governments of the occupied countries. When Nazi Germany conquered territory, on the other hand, it did not attempt to create copies of the German government back home. Instead, it experimented with different power structures and policies, often reflecting a “far more ample Nazification of society than what the balance of power authorized in the Reich.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of terror and violence===
Another major topic investigated by Werth and Burrin was the violence and terror employed by the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Werth reports that the Stalinist USSR underwent an “extraordinary brutalization of the relations between state and society” for the purpose of rapid modernization and industrialization, to “gain one hundred years in one decade, and to metamorphose the country into a great industrial power.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation was accomplished at the cost of massive violence and a sociopolitical regression into what Werth calls “military-feudal exploitation.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The types of violence employed by the Stalinist regime included loss of civil rights, mass arrests, deportations of entire ethnic groups from one part of the USSR to another, forced labor in the [[Gulag]], mass executions (especially during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937-38), and most of all the great famine of 1932-33, known as the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; All levels of Soviet society were affected by Stalinist repression, from the top to the bottom. At the top, high-ranking members of the Communist Party were arrested and executed under the claim that they had plotted against Stalin (and in some cases they were forced to confess to imaginary crimes in [[Moscow Trials|show trials]]). At the bottom, the peasantry suffered the Holodomor famine (especially in [[Ukraine]]), and even outside of the famine years they were faced with very high grain quotas.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Werth identifies four categories of people that became the targets of Stalinist violence in the USSR. He lists them from smallest to largest. The first and smallest group consisted of many of Stalin’s former comrades-in-arms, who had participated in the revolution and were known as “[[Old Bolshevik]]s.” They were dangerous to Stalin because they had known him before his rise to power and could expose the many false claims made by his personality cult. The second group consisted of mid-level Communist Party officials, who were subject to mass arrests and executions in the late 1930s, particularly during the Great Purge. Eliminating them served a dual purpose: It helped Stalin to centralize power in the Kremlin (as opposed to regional centers), and it also provided him with “corrupt officials” that he could blame for earlier repressions and unpopular policies. Werth draws parallels between this and the old [[Tsarist]] tradition of blaming “bad bureaucrats” – rather than the [[Tsar]] – for unpopular government actions.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The third group was made up of ordinary citizens from all walks of life who resorted to petty crime in order to provide for themselves in the face of worsening living standards (for example by taking home some wheat from the fields or tools from the factory). This type of petty crime became very widespread, and was often punished as if it were intentional sabotage motivated by political opposition to the USSR. The fourth and largest category consisted of ethnic groups that were subject to deportation, famine, or arbitrary arrests under the suspicion of being collectively disloyal to Stalin or to the Soviet state. This included the Holodomor famine directed at the [[Ukrainians]], the deportation of ethnic groups suspected of pro-German sympathies (such as the [[Volga Germans]], the [[Crimean Tatars]], the [[Chechens]] and others), and eventually also persecution of ethnic [[Jews]], especially as [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin grew increasingly antisemitic]] near the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin’s study of violence carried out by the Nazi regime begins with the observation that “violence is at the heart of Nazism,” and that Nazi violence is “established as a doctrine and exalted in speech.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a point of difference between Nazism and Stalinism, according to Burrin. In Stalinism, there was a gulf between ideology and reality when it came to violence. The Soviet regime continuously denied that it was repressive, proclaimed itself a defender of peace, and sought to conceal all the evidence to the contrary. In Nazism, on the other hand, “doctrine and reality were fused from the start.” Nazism not only practiced violent repression and war, but advocated it in principle as well, considering war to be a positive force in human civilization and openly seeking [[lebensraum|”living space”]] and the domination of the European continent by ethnic Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin identifies three motivations for Nazi violence: political repression, exclusion and social repression, and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, political repression, is common in many dictatorships. The Nazis aimed to eliminate their real or imagined political opponents, first in the Reich and later in the occupied territories during the war. Some of these opponents were executed, while others were imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. The first targets of political repression, immediately after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, were the parties of the Left in general and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after the mid-1930s, repression was extended to members of the clergy, and later to the conservative opposition as well (especially after the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944). The death penalty was used on a wide scale, even before the war. During the war, political repression was greatly expanded both inside Germany and especially in the newly occupied territories. Political prisoners in the concentration camps numbered only about 25,000 at the beginning of the war. By January 1945 they had swelled to 714,211 – most of them non-Germans accused of plotting against the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of Nazi violence, motivated by exclusion and social repression, was the violence aimed at purging German society of people whose lifestyle was considered incompatible with the social norms of the Nazi regime (even if the people involved were racially pure and able-bodied). Such people were divided into two categories: [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and “asocials.” The “asocials” were only vaguely defined, and included “Gypsies, tramps, beggars, prostitutes, alcoholics, the jobless who refused any employment, and those who left their work frequently or for no reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final type of Nazi violence, by far the most extensive, was violence motivated by [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]]. This was aimed both inward, to cleanse the “Aryan race” of “degenerate” elements and [[life unworthy of life]], as well as outward, to seek the extermination of [[Untermensch|“inferior races”]]. Germans considered physically or mentally unfit were among the first victims. One of the first laws of the Nazi regime mandated the forced sterilization of people suffering from physical handicaps or who had psychiatric conditions deemed to be hereditary. Later, sterilization was replaced by murder of the mentally ill and of people with severe disabilities, as part of a “euthanasia” program called [[Aktion T4]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Burrin notes that this served no practical political purpose – the people being murdered could not have possibly been political opponents of the regime – so the motivation was purely a matter of racial ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The most systematic and by far the most large-scale acts of Nazi violence, however, were directed at “racially inferior” non-German populations. As laid out in ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the Nazis wished to eliminate most of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] populations of Eastern Europe, partly through deportation and partly through murder, in order to secure land for ethnic German settlement and colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; But even more urgently, the Nazis wished to exterminate the [[Jews]] of Europe, whom they regarded as the implacable racial enemy of the Germans. This culminated in the [[Holocaust]], the Nazi [[genocide]] of the Jews. Unlike in the case of all other target populations, the Jews were to be exterminated completely, with no individual exceptions for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geyer and Fitzpatrick ==
In ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', editors [[Michael Geyer]] and [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]] disputed the concept of totalitarianism, noting that the term entered political discourse first as a term of self-description by the Italian Fascists and was only later used as a framework to compare Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the totalitarian states were not as monolithic or as ideology-driven as they seemed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick describe Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR as “immensely powerful, threatening, and contagious dictatorships” who “shook the world in their antagonism.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Without calling them totalitarian, they identified their common features, including genocide, an all-powerful party, a charismatic leader, and pervasive invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, they argue that Stalinism and Nazism did not represent a new and unique type of government, but rather that they can be placed in the broader context of the turn to dictatorship in Europe in the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The reason they appear extraordinary is because they were the “most prominent, most hard-headed, and most violent” of the European dictatorships of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They are comparable because of their “shock and awe” and sheer ruthlessness, but underneath superficial similarities they were fundamentally different and that “when it comes to one-on-one comparison, the two societies and regimes may as well have hailed from different worlds.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geyer and Fitzpatrick, the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism stem from the fact that they were both “ideology driven” and sought to subordinate all aspects of life to their respective ideologies. The differences stem from the fact that their ideologies were opposed to each other and regarded each other as enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Another major difference is that Stalin created a stable and long-lasting regime, while Nazi Germany had a “short-lived, explosive nature.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the stable state created by Stalinism was based on an entirely new elite, while Nazism, despite having the support of the traditional elite, failed to achieve stability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the two regimes did borrow ideas from one another, especially regarding propaganda techniques (most of all in architecture and cinema), but also in terms of state surveillance and antisemitism. At the same time, they both vigorously denied borrowing anything from each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; While their methods of propaganda were similar, the content was different. For instance, Soviet wartime propaganda revolved around the idea of resisting imperial aggression, while Nazi propaganda was about wars of racial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick also take note of the fact that both Stalinism and Nazism sought to create a New Man, an “entirely modern, illiberal, and self-fashioned personage,” even though they had different visions about what being a “New Man” would mean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopolitics, eugenics and social engineering===
Among the other authors contributing to the volume edited by Geyer and Fitzpatrick, David Hoffmann and Annette Timm discuss [[biopolitics]] and the pro-natalist policies of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Both governments were highly concerned over low fertility rates in their respective populations, and applied extensive and intrusive [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] techniques to increase the number of births.&lt;ref name="Geyer9"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 83-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive policies in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were administered through their health care systems—both regimes saw health care as a key pillar to their designs to develop a new society.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Soviet Union had to design a public health care system from scratch, Nazi Germany built upon the pre-existing public health care system in Germany that had existed since 1883, when [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s legislation had created the world's first national public health care program.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"/&gt; The Nazis centralized the German health care system in order to enforce Nazi ideological components upon it, and replaced existing voluntary and government welfare agencies with new ones that were devoted to racial hygiene and other components of Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Geyer11"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi and Stalinist attempt to control family size was not unique, as many other European states practiced [[eugenics]] at this time, and the Stalinist and Nazi ideals were vastly different.&lt;ref name="Geyer6"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, they had more in common with third parties than with each other: Nazi Germany’s policies were rather similar to those in Scandinavia at the time, while the USSR’s policies resembled those in Catholic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;The common point between Nazi and Stalinist practices was the connection of reproduction policies with the ideological goals of the state — "part of the project of a rational, hypermodern vision for the re-organization of society".&lt;ref name="Geyer7"&gt;[[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; There were nevertheless substantial differences between the two regimes' approaches. Stalin's Soviet Union never officially supported eugenics as the Nazis did—the Soviet government called eugenics a "fascist science"—although there were in fact Soviet eugenicists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/connections/54ece589642e09bce5000001|title=Russia (former USSR)|work=The Eugenics Archives|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two regimes also had different approaches to the relationship between family and paid labor—Nazism promoted the male single-breadwinner family while Stalinism promoted the dual-wage-earner household.&lt;ref name="Geyer8"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass violence, xenophobia and persecution of ethnic minorities===
In another contribution to the same volume, Christian Gerlach and Nicolas Werth discuss the topic of mass violence, and the way that it was used by both Stalinism and Nazism.&lt;ref name="Geyer13"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalin's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were violent societies where mass violence was accepted by the state, such as in the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937 to 1938 in the Soviet Union and [[the Holocaust]] in Nazi Germany and its occupied territories in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Geyer15"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 135, 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany utilized internment camps led by agents of the state – the NKVD in the Soviet Union and the SS in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Geyer13" /&gt; They also both engaged in violence against minorities based on [[xenophobia]] – the xenophobic violence of the Nazis was outspoken but rationalized as being against "asocial" elements while the xenophobic violence of the Stalinists was disguised as being against "anti-soviet", "[[counter-revolutionary]]" and "socially harmful" elements – a term which often targeted diaspora nationalities.&lt;ref name="Geyer14"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stalinist Soviet Union established "special settlements" where the "socially harmful" or "socially dangerous" who included ex-convicts, criminals, vagrants, the disenfranchised and "declassed elements" were expelled to.&lt;ref name="Geyer15a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; These "special settlements" were largely in Siberia, the far north, the Urals, or other inhospitable territories.&lt;ref name="Geyer16"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1933, the Soviet Union made a mass arrest of 5000 [[Romani people]] effectively on the basis of their ethnicity, who were deported that month to the "special settlements" in Western Siberia.&lt;ref name="Geyer16" /&gt; In 1935, the Soviet Union arrested 160,000 homeless people and juvenile delinquents and sent many of them to NKVD labor colonies where they did [[forced labor]].&lt;ref name="Geyer17"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi regime was founded upon a racialist view of politics and envisioned the deportation or extermination of the majority of the population of Eastern Europe in order to open up “living space” for ethnic German settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; This was mainly intended to be carried out after an eventual German victory in the war, but steps had already started being taken while the war was still ongoing. For instance, by the end of 1942, the Nazis had deported 365,000 Poles and Jews from their original homes in western Poland (now German-annexed) and into the [[General Government]]. A further 194,000 Poles were internally displaced (not deported to another territory but expelled from their homes). The Nazis had also deported 100,000 persons from Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, as well as 54,000 Slovenians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalinism in practice in the Soviet Union pursued ethnic deportations from the 1930s to the early 1950s, with a total of 3 million Soviet citizens being subjected to ethnic-based resettlement.&lt;ref name="Geyer17a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major ethnic deportation took place from December 1932 to January 1933, during which some 60,000 Kuban Cossacks were collectively criminally charged as a whole with association with resistance to socialism and affiliation with Ukrainian nationalism.&lt;ref name="Geyer18"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1936, the Soviet Union deported Soviet citizens of Polish and German origins living in the western districts of Ukraine, and Soviet citizens of Finnish origins living on the Finland-Soviet Union border.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; These deportations from 1935 to 1936 affected tens of thousands of families.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; From September to October 1937, Soviet authorities deported the Korean minority from its Far Eastern region that bordered on Japanese-controlled Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Soviet authorities claimed the territory was "rich soil for the Japanese to till" – implying a Soviet suspicion that the Koreans could potentially join forces with the Japanese to unite the land with Japanese-held Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Over 170,000 Koreans were deported to remote parts of Soviet Central Asia from September to October 1937. These ethnically-based deportations reflected a new trend in Stalinist policy, a "Soviet xenophobia" based on ideological grounds that suspected that these people were susceptible to foreign influence, and which was also based on a resurgent [[Russian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt;

After Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet Union initiated another major round of ethnic deportations. The first group targeted were Soviet Germans. Between September 1941 and February 1942, 900,000 people – over 70 percent of the entire Soviet German community – were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia in mass operations.&lt;ref name="Geyer19"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of mass deportations took place between November 1943 and May 1944, in which Soviet authorities expelled six ethnic groups (the [[Balkars]], [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Karachai]], and [[Kalmyks]]) that together numbered 900,000.&lt;ref name="Geyer20"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also smaller-scale operations involving ethnic cleansing of diaspora minorities during and after World War II, in which tens of thousands of Crimean Bulgarians, Greeks, Iranians, Khemshils, Kurds, and Meskhetian Turks were deported from the Black Sea and Transcaucasian border regions.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt;

Two ethnic groups that were specifically targeted for persecution by Stalin's Soviet Union were the Chechens and the Ingush.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Unlike the other nationalities that could be suspected of connection to foreign states which shared their ethnic background, the Chechens and the Ingush were completely indigenous people of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Rather than being accused of collaboration with foreign enemies, these two ethnic groups were considered to have cultures which did not fit in with Soviet culture – such as accusing Chechens of being associated with “banditism” – and the authorities claimed that the Soviet Union had to intervene in order to “remake” and “reform” these cultures.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; In practice this meant heavily armed punitive operations carried out against Chechen “bandits” that failed to achieve forced assimilation, culminating in an ethnic cleansing operation in 1944, which involved the arrests and deportation of over 500,000 Chechens and Ingush from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Central Asia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="Geyer21"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; The deportations of the Chechens and Ingush also involved the outright massacre of thousands of people, and severe conditions placed upon the deportees – they were put in unsealed train cars, with little to no food for a four-week journey during which many died from hunger and exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Geyer22"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between Nazi and Stalinist deportations was in their purpose: while Nazi Germany sought ethnic cleansing to allow settlement by Germans into the cleansed territory, Stalin's Soviet Union pursued ethnic cleansing in order to remove minorities from strategically important areas.&lt;ref name="Geyer23"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other scholars==
&lt;!-- This section contains statements sourced to scholarly authors who have written on the topic of the comparison between Nazism and Stalinism, but for whom we only have a little information in the article at the moment, so it would not make sense to assign a separate section to each of them. As the material cited to a given author grows beyond two or three paragraphs, consider giving that author a dedicated section. --&gt;

Other historians and political scientists have also made comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism as part of their work.

[[Stanley Payne]], in his work on fascism, said that although the Nazi Party was ideologically opposed to communism, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently expressed recognition that only in Soviet Russia were their revolutionary and ideological counterparts to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Payne|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=15 March 1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299080648|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both placed a major emphasis on creating a "party-army," with the regular armed forces controlled by the party. In the case of the Soviet Union this was done through the [[political commissar]]s, while Nazi Germany introduced a roughly equivalent leadership role for "National Socialist Guidance Officers" in 1943.&lt;ref name="Payne1"&gt;[[#Payne1983|Payne (1983)]]. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Furet]], in his work on communism, noted that Hitler personally admired Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and on numerous occasions publicly praised Stalin for seeking to purify the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of Jewish influences, especially by purging Jewish communists such as [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Karl Radek]].&lt;ref name="François Furet 1999. Pp. 191-192"&gt;François Furet. ''Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century''. University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-27340-7}}. Pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Pipes]] draws attention to [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin and his antisemitism]] in a parallel with [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi antisemitism]]. He notes that soon after the 1917 October Revolution, the Soviet Union undertook practices to break up Jewish culture, religion and language. In the fall of 1918, the Soviet Communist Party set up the Jewish section [[Yevsektsiya]], with a stated mission of “destruction of traditional Jewish life, the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, and Hebrew culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; By 1919, the Bolsheviks  began to confiscate Jewish properties, Hebrew schools, libraries, books, and synagogues in accordance with newly imposed anti-religious laws, turning their buildings into "Communist centers, clubs or restaurants."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; After Joseph Stalin rose to power, antisemitism continued to be endemic throughout Russia, although official Soviet policy condemned it. On August 12, 1952, Stalin's personal antisemitism became more visible, as he ordered the execution of the most prominent Yiddish authors in the Soviet Union, in an event known as the "[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]". Shortly before his death, Stalin also organized the anti-Semitic campaign known as the [[Doctors' plot]].

A number of research institutions are focusing on the analysis of fascism/Nazism and Stalinism/communism, and the comparative approach, including the [[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]] in Germany, the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] in the Czech Republic and the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in Poland.

In comparing the deaths caused by both Stalin and Hitler's policies, some historians have asserted that archival evidence released after the collapse of the USSR confirms that Stalin did not kill more people than Hitler. American historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]], for example, after assessing such data, says that while the Nazi regime killed approximately 11 million non-combatants (which rises to above 12 million if "foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included"), Stalin's deliberately killed about 6 million (rising to 9 million if foreseeable deaths arising from policies are taken into account).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|title=Hitler vs. Stalin: Who Was Worse?|website=The New York Review of Books|date=27 January 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/|accessdate=25 May 2018|quote=" The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans—about 11 million—is roughly what we had thought. The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did . . . All in all, the Germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included. For the Soviets during the Stalin period, the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million. These figures are of course subject to revision, but it is very unlikely that the consensus will change again as radically as it has since the opening of Eastern European archives in the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian historian and archival researcher [[Stephen G. Wheatcroft]] posits that "The Stalinist regime was consequently responsible for about a million purposive killings, and through its criminal neglect and irresponsibility it was probably responsible for the premature deaths of about another two million more victims amongst the repressed population, i.e. in the camps, colonies, prisons, exile, in transit and in the POW camps for Germans. These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler's regime was responsible." Wheatcroft also says that, unlike Hitler, Stalin's "purposive killings" fit more closely into the category of "execution" than "murder", given he thought the accused were indeed guilty of crimes against the state and insisted on documentation, whereas Hitler simply wanted to kill Jews and communists because of who they were, and insisted on no documentation and was indifferent at even a pretence of legality for these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/WCR-German_Soviet.pdf|title=The Scale and Nature of German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930–45|last=Wheatcroft|first=S.

[[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], an ethnographer of post-Cold War Eastern Europe, contends that the efforts to institutionalize the "double genocide thesis", or the moral equivalence between the Nazi Holocaust (race murder) and the victims of communism (class murder), and in particular the recent push at the beginning of the global financial crisis for commemoration of the latter in Europe, can be seen as the response by economic and political elites to fears of a leftist resurgence in the face of devastated economies and extreme inequalities in both the East and West as the result of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] capitalism. She notes that any discussion of the achievements under communism, including literacy, education, women’s rights, and social security is usually silenced, and any discourse on the subject of communism is focused almost exclusively on Stalin's crimes and the "double genocide thesis", an intellectual paradigm summed up as such: "1) any move towards redistribution and away from a completely free market is seen as communist; 2) anything communist inevitably leads to class murder; and 3) class murder is the moral equivalent of the Holocaust." By linking all leftist and socialist ideals to the excesses of Stalinism, Ghodsee concludes, the elites in the West hope to discredit and marginalize all political ideologies that could "threaten the primacy of private property and free markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Ghodsee|first1=Kristen R.|volume = 4| issue = 2| pages = 115–142|title = A Tale of "Two Totalitarianisms": The Crisis of Capitalism and the Historical Memory of Communism| journal = History of the Present| date = 2014|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/history_of_the_present_galleys.pdf | jstor = 10.5406/historypresent.4.2.0115|authorlink=Kristen R.

The comparison of Nazism and Stalinism has long provoked political controversy,&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian; Moshé Lewin"&gt;Kershaw pp3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleck&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleck |first=Christian|title=Intellectuals and their publics: perspectives from the social sciences|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7540-2|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it led to [[Historikerstreit|the historians' dispute]] within Germany in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Lévy, Daniel.

In the 1920s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), under the leadership of Chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], adopted the view that "red equals brown", i.e. that the communists and Nazis posed an equal danger to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelheid von Saldern, ''The Challenge of Modernity: German Social and Cultural Studies, 1890-1960'', University of Michigan Press (2002), {{ISBN|0-472-10986-3}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, [[Kurt Schumacher]] said that the two movements enabled each other.

Erfahrungen mit Diktatur in der DDR und Auswirkungen auf das Verhältnis zur Diktatur heute |url= |accessdate= |isbn=3-8258-8789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison was mirrored by the [[social fascism]] theory advanced by the Soviet government and the [[Comintern]] (including the Communist Party of Germany), which accused [[social democracy]] of enabling fascism and went as far as to call social democrats "social fascists."&lt;ref&gt;Horst Ehmke, ''Mittendrin: von der grossen Koalition zur deutschen Einheit'', Rowohlt, 1994, {{ISBN|3-87134-089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] was announced, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an editorial arguing that "Hitlerism is brown communism, Stalinism is red fascism."&lt;ref&gt;"Editorial: The Russian Betrayal", ''The New York Times'', Sept. 18, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxist theories of fascism have seen fascism as a form of reaction to socialism and a feature of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Dave Renton. ''Fascism: Theory and Practice''. London: Pluto Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern historians have tried to pay more attention to the economic, political and ideological differences between these two regimes than to their similarities.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Henry Rousso. "Stalinism and Nazism. History and Memory Compared". ''Historische Zeitschrift''. 286:3, 2008. Pp. 795–796.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2008 [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]], initiated by the [[Czech government]] and signed by figures such as [[Václav Havel]], called for "a common approach regarding crimes of totalitarian regimes, inter alia Communist regimes" and for
{{quote|reaching an all-European understanding that both the Nazi and Communist totalitarian regimes each to be judged by their own terrible merits to be destructive in their policies of systematically applying extreme forms of terror, suppressing all civic and human liberties, starting aggressive wars and, as an inseparable part of their ideologies, exterminating and deporting whole nations and groups of population; and that as such they should be considered to be the main disasters, which blighted the 20th century.&lt;ref name="declaration-text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.praguedeclaration.eu/ |title=Prague Declaration - Declaration Text |date=3 June 2008 |publisher=[[Institute for Information on the Crimes of Communism]] |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Communist Party of Greece]] opposes the Prague Declaration and has criticized "the new escalation of the [[anti-communist]] hysteria led by the EU council, the European Commission and the political staff of the bourgeois class in the European Parliament."&lt;ref name="CommunistPartyGreece"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inter.kke.gr/News/news2011/2011-02-03-anticom-euparliament/ |title= Statement-condemnation of the escalation of the anti-communist hysteria by the EU |date= 2011-02-03 |publisher= [[Communist Party of Greece]] |accessdate= 2011-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party of Britain]] opined that the Prague Declaration "is a rehash of the persistent attempts by reactionary historians to equate Soviet Communism and Hitlerite Fascism, echoing the old slanders of British authors [[George Orwell]] and [[Robert Conquest]]."&lt;ref name="CommunistPartyUK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://communist-party.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Acp-contribution-to-international-conference-on-prague-declaration&amp;catid=128%3Aconferences&amp;Itemid=162 |title=CP contribution to International Conference on Prague Declaration |date=13 February 2010 |publisher=[[Communist Party of Britain]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64orFpG5S?url=http://communist-party.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Acp-contribution-to-international-conference-on-prague-declaration&amp;catid=128%3Aconferences&amp;Itemid=162 |accessdate=2011-05-16 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 documentary film ''[[The Soviet Story]]'', commissioned by the [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] group in the [[European Parliament]], published archival records which listed thousands of German Jews who were arrested in the Soviet Union by the [[NKVD]] (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) from 1937 to 1941 and handed over to [[Gestapo]] or SS officials in Germany. These German Jews had originally sought asylum in the USSR. The documentary film accuses Stalin's regime of being an accomplice in Hitler's Holocaust by arresting these asylum seekers and sending them back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Story'', Edvins Snore, writer/director, 85-minute documentary, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the [[European Union]] has officially commemorated the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]],&lt;ref name="Buzek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |title=President Jerzy Buzek on the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf46Gk7v?url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed by the [[European Parliament]] in 2008&lt;ref name="Buzek" /&gt; and endorsed by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8133749.stm|title=Resolution on Stalin riles Russia|date=3 July 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially known as the Black Ribbon Day in some countries (including Canada).&lt;ref name="TorontoSun2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Victims of totalitarianism remembered |author= Daniel Proussalidis |url= http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/23/victims-of-totalitarianism-remembered |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[President of the European Parliament]] and [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] member, [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]], argued that "both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible."&lt;ref name="eurolt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |title=Baltic States opened Western Europe's eyes on Soviet Union totalitarianism -- EP chairman in Vilnius |date=2009-04-28 |publisher=BNS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722150204/http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Eastern Europe]]an countries the denial of both Nazi and Communist crimes has been explicitly outlawed, and Czech foreign minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] has argued that "there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard."&lt;ref name="romea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |title=Czech Foreign Minister: Denial of communist crimes like denial of Nazi crimes |publisher=Romea.cz |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf7qICc8?url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |archivedate=14 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[European Commission]] rejected calls for similar EU-wide legislation, due to the lack of consensus among member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU rejects eastern states' call to outlaw denial of crimes by communist regimes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/21/european-commission-communist-crimes-nazism|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2011|location=London|first=Leigh |last=Phillips|date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement adopted by Russia's legislature said that comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism are "blasphemous towards all of the anti-fascist movement veterans, Holocaust victims, concentration camp prisoners and tens of millions of people ... who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the fight against the Nazis' anti-human racial theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/nuremberg-trials-ww2-russia/ |title=Russian MPs call on world to suppress attempts to revive Nazi ideology |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]] |date=2010-10-24|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British journalist [[Seumas Milne]] posits that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, and therefore Communism is as monstrous as Nazism, "has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/sep/12/highereducation.historyandhistoryofart Seumas Milne: The battle for history]. ''The Guardian''. (12 September 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=May 2015}}
A '''contraction''' is a shortened version of the written and spoken forms of a word, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters and sounds.

In linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with [[crasis]], [[abbreviation]]s nor [[acronym]]s (including initialisms), with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all three are connoted by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Hart's Rules|New Hart's Rules]]: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-861041-6|year=2005|author = Roberts R|display-authors=etal}} {{rp|p.167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contraction is also distinguished from [[clipping (morphology)|clipping]], where beginnings and endings are omitted.

The definition overlaps with the term [[portmanteau]] (a linguistic ''[[Blend word|blend]]''), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as ''do'' and ''not'', whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept which the portmanteau describes.

== English ==
{{main|English auxiliaries and contractions}}

[[English language|English]] has a number of contractions, mostly involving the elision of a vowel (which is replaced by an [[apostrophe]] in writing), as in ''I'm'' for "I am", and sometimes other changes as well, as in ''won't'' for "will not" or ''ain't'' for "am not". These contractions are commonly used in speech and in informal writing, though tend to be avoided in more formal writing (with limited exceptions, such as the mandatory form of "o'clock").

The main contractions are listed in the following table (for more explanation see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]]).

| you
| y'-

|}

Some other simplified pronunciations of common word groups, which can often equally be described as cases of [[elision]], may also be considered (non-standard) contractions (not enshrined into the written standard language, but frequently expressed in written form anyway), such as ''wanna'' for ''want to'', ''gonna'' for ''going to'', ''y'all'' for ''you all'',  ''ya'll'' for ''ya all'' in the [[Southern United States]] and others common forms in colloquial speech.

In [[subject–auxiliary inversion]], the contracted negative forms behave as if they were auxiliaries themselves, changing place with the subject. For example, the interrogative form of ''He won't go'' is '''''Won't he''' go'', whereas the uncontracted equivalent is ''Will he not go?'', with ''not'' following the subject.

== Chinese ==

Contractions exist in [[Classical Chinese]], some of which are used in modern Chinese.

Contractions also appear in [[Cantonese]], for example, 乜嘢&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E4%B9%9C%E5%98%A2&amp;oldid=27284238|title=乜嘢|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 咩.

== French ==

The [[French language]] has a variety of contractions, similar to English but mandatory, as in ''[[wiktionary:c'est la vie|C'est la vie]]'' ("That's life"), where ''c'est'' stands for ''ce'' + ''est'' ("that is"). The formation of these contractions is called [[Elision (French)|elision]].

In general, any monosyllabic word ending in ''[[e caduc]]'' (schwa) will contract if the following word begins with a vowel, ''h'' or ''y'' (as ''h'' is silent and absorbed by the sound of the succeeding vowel; ''y'' sounds like ''i''). In addition to ''ce'' → ''c'-'' (demonstrative pronoun "that"), these words are ''que'' → ''qu'-'' (conjunction, relative pronoun, or interrogative pronoun "that"), ''ne'' → ''n'-'' ("not"), ''se'' → ''s'-'' ("himself", "herself", "itself", "oneself" before a verb), ''je'' → ''j'-'' ("I"), ''me'' → ''m'-'' ("me" before a verb), ''te'' → ''t'- '' (informal singular "you" before a verb), ''le'' or ''la'' → ''l'-'' ("the"; or  "he/she", "it" before a verb or after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''), and ''de'' → ''d'-'' ("of"). Unlike with English contractions, however, these contractions are mandatory: one would never say (or write) ''*ce est'' or ''*que elle''.

''Moi'' ("myself") and ''toi'' (informal "yourself") mandatorily contract to ''m'-'' and ''t'-'' respectively after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''.

It is also mandatory to avoid the repetition of a sound when the conjunction ''si'' ("if") is followed by ''il'' ("he", "it") or ''ils'' ("they"), which begin with the same vowel sound ''i'': ''*si il'' → ''s'il'' ("if it", if he"); ''*si ils'' → ''s'ils'' ("if they").

Certain prepositions are also mandatorily merged with masculine and plural direct articles: ''au'' for ''à le'', ''aux'' for ''à les'', ''du'' for ''de le'', and ''des'' for ''de les''. However, the contraction of ''cela'' (demonstrative pronoun "that") to ''ça'' is optional and informal.

In informal speech, a personal pronoun may sometimes be contracted onto a following verb. For example, ''je ne sais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʒənəsɛpa|IPA}}, "I don't know") may be pronounced roughly ''chais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛpa|IPA}}), with the ''ne'' being completely elided and the {{IPA-fr|ʒ|}} of ''je'' being mixed with the {{IPA-fr|s|}} of ''sais''.{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}  It is also common in informal contexts to contract ''tu'' to ''t'-'' before a vowel, e.g., ''t'as mangé'' for ''tu as mangé''.

== Hebrew ==

In [[Modern Hebrew]], the prepositional prefixes -בְּ /bə-/ 'in' and -לְ /lə-/ 'to' contract with the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) to form the prefixes -ב /ba/ 'in the' and -ל /la/ 'to the'. In [[Modern Hebrew|colloquial Israeli Hebrew]], the preposition את (/ʔet/), which indicates a definite direct object, and the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) are often contracted to 'ת (/ta-/) when the former immediately precedes the latter.  Thus ראיתי את הכלב (/ʁaˈʔiti ʔet haˈkelev/, "I saw the dog") may become ראיתי ת'כלב (/ʁaˈʔiti taˈkelev/).

== Italian ==

In Italian, prepositions merge with direct articles in predictable ways. The prepositions ''a'', ''da'', ''di'', ''in'', ''su'', ''con'' and ''per'' combine with the various forms of the definite article, namely ''il'', ''lo'', ''la'', ''l','' ''i'', ''gli'', ''gl','' and ''le''.

* Contractions with a, da, di, in, and su are mandatory, but those with con and per are optional.
* Words in parentheses are no longer commonly used, but some still exist in common expressions such as ''colla voce''.
* Formerly, ''gl''' was used before words beginning with ''i'', however it is no longer in common use.

The words ''ci'' and ''è'' (form of ''essere'', to be) and the words ''vi'' and ''è'' are contracted into ''c'è'' and ''v'è'' (both meaning "there is").
* “''C'è'' / ''V'è'' un problema”&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; There is a problem

The words ''dove'' and any word that begins with ''e'' are contracted into one single, deleting the e of the principal word, dove (dov'). Equally ''come'' does be made so.
As well other words may be contracted the same these two, like ''quale'', and other ones, etcetera.

== Spanish ==

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has two mandatory phonetic contractions between prepositions and articles: ''al'' (to the) for ''a el'', and ''del'' (of the) for ''de el'' (not to be confused with ''a él'', meaning ''to him'', and ''de él'', meaning ''his'' or, more literally, ''of him'').

Other contractions were common in writing until the 17th century, the most usual being ''de'' + personal and demonstrative pronouns: ''destas'' for ''de estas'' (of these, fem.), ''daquel'' for ''de aquel'' (of that, masc.), ''dél'' for ''de él'' (of him) etc.; and the feminine article before words beginning with ''a-'': ''l'alma'' for ''la alma'', now ''el alma'' (the soul). Several sets of demonstrative pronouns originated as contractions of ''aquí'' (here) + pronoun, or pronoun + ''otro/a'' (other): ''aqueste'', ''aqueso'', ''estotro'' etc. The modern ''aquel'' (that, masc.) is the only survivor of the first pattern; the personal pronouns ''nosotros'' (we) and ''vosotros'' (pl. you) are remnants of the second. In medieval texts unstressed words very often appear contracted: ''todol'' for ''todo el'' (all the, masc.), ''ques'' for ''que es'' (which is); etc. including with common words, like d'ome (d'home/d'homme) instead de ome (home/homme), and so on.

Though not strictly a contraction, a special form is used when combining con with mí, ti or sí which is written as ''conmigo'' for *''con mí'' (with me), ''contigo'' for *''con ti'' (with you sing.), ''consigo'' for *''con sí'' (with himself/herself/itself/themselves (themself).

Finally, one can hear {{clarify|reason=in which dialects?|date=January 2014}} ''pa''' for ''para'', deriving as ''pa'l'' for ''para el'', but these forms are only considered appropriate in informal speech.

== Portuguese ==

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], contractions are common and much more numerous than those in Spanish. Several prepositions regularly contract with certain articles and pronouns. For instance, ''de'' (of) and ''por'' (by; formerly ''per'') combine with the definite articles ''o'' and ''a'' (masculine and feminine forms of "the" respectively), producing ''do'', ''da'' (of the), ''pelo'', ''pela'' (by the). The preposition ''de'' contracts with the pronouns ''ele'' and ''ela'' (he, she), producing ''dele'', ''dela'' (his, her). In addition, some verb forms contract with enclitic object pronouns: e.g., the verb ''amar'' (to love) combines with the pronoun ''a'' (her), giving ''amá-la'' (to love her).

Another contraction in portuguese which is similar to English ones is the combination of the pronoun ''da'' with words starting in ''a'', resulting in changing the first letter ''a'' for an apostrophe and joining both words. Examples: ''Estrela d'alva'' (A popular phrase to refer to [[Venus]] that means "Alb star", as a reference to its brightness) ; ''Caixa d'água'' (water tank).

== German ==

In informal, spoken [[German language|German]] [[prepositional phrase]]s, one can often merge the preposition and the [[article (grammar)|article]]; for example, ''von dem'' becomes ''vom'', ''zu dem'' becomes ''zum'', or ''an das'' becomes ''ans''. Some of these are so common that they are mandatory. In informal speech, ''aufm'' for ''auf dem'', ''unterm'' for ''unter dem'', etc. are also  used, but would be considered to be incorrect if written, except maybe in quoted direct speech, in appropriate context and style.

The pronoun ''es'' often contracts to ''{{'}}s'' (usually written with the apostrophe) in certain contexts. For example, the greeting ''Wie geht es?'' is usually encountered in the contracted form ''Wie geht's?''.

=== Local languages in German-speaking areas ===

[[Dialectology|Regional dialects]] of German, and various local languages which usually were already used long before today's [[Standard German]] was created, do use contractions usually more frequently than German, but varying widely between different local languages. The informally spoken German contractions are observed almost everywhere, most often accompanied by additional ones, such as ''in den'' becoming ''in'n'' (sometimes ''im'') or ''haben wir'' becoming ''hamwer'', ''hammor'', ''hemmer'', or ''hamma'' depending on local intonation preferences. [[Bavarian language|Bavarian German]] features several more contractions such as ''gesund sind wir'' becoming ''xund samma'' which are schematically applied to all word or combinations of similar sound. (One must remember, however, that German ''wir'' exists alongside Bavarian ''mir'', or ''mia'', with the same meaning.) The Munich-born footballer [[Franz Beckenbauer]] has as his catchphrase "Schau mer mal" ("Schauen wir einmal" - in English "let's have a look"). A book about his career had as its title the slightly longer version of the phrase, "Schau'n Mer Mal".

Such features are found in all central and southern language regions. A sample from Berlin: ''Sag einmal, Meister, kann man hier einmal hinein?'' is spoken as ''Samma, Meesta, kamma hier ma rin?''

Several [[West Central German]] dialects along the [[Rhine River]] have built contraction patterns involving long phrases and entire sentences. In speech, words are often concatenated, and frequently the process of [[liaison (French)|"liaison"]] is used. So, ''[Dat] kriegst Du nicht'' may become ''Kressenit'', or ''Lass mich gehen, habe ich gesagt'' may become ''Lomejon haschjesaat''.

Mostly, there are no binding [[orthography|orthographies]] for local dialects of German, hence writing is left to a great extent to authors and their publishers. Outside quotations, at least, they usually pay little attention to print more than the most commonly spoken contractions, so as not to  degrade their readability. The use of apostrophes to indicate omissions is a varying and considerably less frequent process than in English-language publications.

== Norwegian ==

The use of contractions is not allowed in any form of standard [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] spelling, however, it is fairly common to shorten or contract words in spoken language. Yet, the commonness varies from dialect to dialect and from sociolect to sociolect—it depends on the formality etc. of the setting. Some common, and quite drastic, contractions found in Norwegian speech are "jakke" for "jeg har ikke", meaning "I do not have" and "dække" for "det er ikke", meaning "there is not". The most frequently used of these contractions—usually consisting of two or three words contracted into one word, contain short, common and often [[Syllable|monosyllabic]] words like {{wt|nb|jeg}}, {{wt|nb|du}}, {{wt|nb|deg}}, {{wt|nb|det}}, {{wt|nb|har}} or {{wt|nb|ikke}}. The use of the apostrophe (') is much less common than in English, but is sometimes used in contractions to show where letters have been dropped.

In extreme cases, long, entire sentences may be written as one word. An example of this is "Det ordner seg av seg selv" in standard written [[Bokmål]], meaning "It will sort itself out" could become "dånesæsæsjæl" (note the letters [[Å]] and [[Æ]], and the word "sjæl", as an [[eye dialect]] spelling of {{wt|nb|selv}}). [[R-dropping]], being present in the example, is especially common in speech in many areas of Norway {{which|date=March 2018}}, but plays out in different ways, as does elision of word-final phonemes like {{IPA|/ə/}}.

Because of the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of standard Norwegian and eye dialect spelling. It is almost universally true that these spellings try to convey the way each word is pronounced, but it is rare to see language written that does not adhere to at least some of the rules of the official [[Norwegian orthography|orthography]]. Reasons for this include words spelled unphonemically, ignorance of conventional spelling rules, or adaptation for better transcription of that dialect's phonemes.

== Latin ==

Latin contains several examples of contractions. One such case is preserved in the verb ''nolo'' (I am unwilling/do not want) which was formed by a contraction of ''non volo'' (''volo'' meaning “I want”). Similarly this is observed in the first person plural and third person plural forms (nolumus and nolunt respectively).

== Japanese ==

Some contractions in rapid speech include ～っす (''-ssu'') for です (''desu'') and すいません (''suimasen'') for すみません (''sumimasen''). では (''dewa'') is often contracted to じゃ (''ja''). In certain grammatical contexts the particle の (''no'') is contracted to simply ん (''n'').

When used after verbs ending in the conjunctive form ～て (''-te''), certain auxiliary verbs and their derivations are often abbreviated. Examples:

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; this abbreviation is never used in the polite conjugation, to avoid the resultant ambiguity between an abbreviated ''ikimasu'' (go) and the verb ''kimasu'' (come).

The ending ～なければ (''-nakereba'') can be contracted to ～なきゃ (''-nakya'') when it is used to indicate obligation. It is often used without an auxiliary, e.g., 行かなきゃ（いけない） (''ikanakya (ikenai)'') "I have to go."

Other times, contractions are made to create new words or to give added or altered meaning:
* The word 何か (''nanika'') "something" is contracted to なんか (''nanka'') to make a colloquial word with a meaning along the lines of "sort of," but which can be used with almost no meaning. Its usage is as a filler word is similar to English "like."
* じゃない (''ja nai'') "is not" is contracted to じゃん (''jan'') which is used at the end of statements to show the speaker's belief or opinion, often when it is contrary to that of the listener, e.g., いいじゃん！ (''ii jan!'') "What, it's fine!"
* The commonly used particle-verb phrase という (''to iu'') is often contracted to ～って／～て／～っつー (''-tte/-te/-ttsū'') to give a more informal or noncommittal feeling.
* といえば (''to ieba''), the conditional form of という (''to iu'') mentioned above, is contracted to ～ってば (''-tte ba'') to show the speaker's annoyance at the listener's failure to listen to, remember, or heed what the speaker has said, e.g., もういいってば！ (''mō ii tte ba!''), “I already told you I don't want to talk about it anymore!”.
* The common words だ (''da'') and です (''desu'') are older contractions that originate from である (''de aru'') and でございます (''de gozaimasu''). These are fully integrated into the language now, and are not generally thought of as contractions; however in formal writing (e.g., literature, news articles, or technical/scientific writing), である (''de aru'') is used in place of だ (''da'').
* The [[Japanese pronouns|first-person singular pronoun]] 私 is pronounced わたくし (''watakushi'') in very formal speech, but commonly contracted to わたし(''watashi'') in less formal speech, and further clipped in specifically younger women's speech to あたし (''atashi'').

Various [[Japanese dialects|dialects of Japanese]] also use their own specific contractions which are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.

== Polish ==

In the [[Polish language]] pronouns have contracted forms which are more prevalent in their colloquial usage. Examples are ''go'' and ''mu''. The non-contracted forms are ''jego'' (unless it is used as a possessive pronoun) and ''jemu'', respectively. The [[clitic]] ''-ń'' which stands for ''niego'' (him) as in ''dlań'' (''dla niego'') is more common in literature.  The non-contracted forms are generally used as a means to accentuate.&lt;ref&gt;http://nkjp.pl/settings/papers/NKJP_ksiazka.pdf (p.82)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uyghur ==

[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]], includes some verbal suffixes that are actually contracted forms of [[compound verb]]s ([[serial verb construction|serial verbs]]). For instance, ''sëtip alidu'' (sell-manage, "manage to sell") is usually written and pronounced ''sëtivaldu'', with the two words forming a contraction and the [p] [[lenition|leniting]] into a [v] or [w].{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}

== Filipino/Tagalog ==

In Filipino, most contractions need other words to be contracted correctly. Only words that end with vowels can make a contraction with words like "at" and "ay." In this chart, the "@" represents any vowel.

Taking for granted an equal [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|moral status]] as [[person]]s, '''difference feminism''' asserts that there are differences between men and women but that no value judgment can be placed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/carol-gilligan/|title = Carol Gilligan |website= Psychology's Feminist Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "difference feminism" developed during the "equality-versus-difference debate" in American feminism in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Joan|title=Deconstructing Equality-Versus-Difference: Or, the Uses of Post-structuralist Theory for Feminism|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1988|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3177997|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently fell out of favor and use. In the 1990s feminists addressed the binary logic of "difference" versus "equality" and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Gisela|last2=James|first2=Susan|title=Beyond Equality and Difference|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn = 9780415079891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location = London|isbn = 9781446228043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism did not require a commitment to [[gender essentialism|essentialism]]. Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise "essential" link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called "ways of knowing"&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=2 footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued "feminine" characteristics.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tandon|first1=Neeru|title=Feminism: A Paradigm Shift|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strains of difference feminism, for example [[Mary Daly]]'s, argue not just that women and men were different, and had different values or different ways of knowing, but that women and their values were superior to men's.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This viewpoint does not require essentialism, although there is ongoing debate about whether Daly's feminism is essentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoagland|first1=Sarah Lucia|last2=Frye|first2=Marilyn|title=Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandilands|first1=Catriona|title=The Good-Natured Feminist Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy|date=1999|pages=chapter 5: "Cyborgs and Queers"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Difference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer [[Elise Oelsner]], which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics (like care [see [[ethics of care]]]). On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase "difference feminism" in a way that asks "what difference does feminism make?" (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than "what differences are there between men and women"?&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Essentialism and Difference Feminism==
Some have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] and radical feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]], is "essentialist." In philosophy essentialism is the belief that "(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accidental vs Essential Properties|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sexual politics essentialism is taken to mean that "women" and "men" have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of "essentialism" are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida J.|title=Anti-Essentialism in Practice: Carol Gilligan and Feminist Philosophy|journal=Hypatia|date=1997|volume=13|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1997.tb00009.x|pages=142–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title="Essentialism" in Feminism and Psychoanalysis: A Critical Dictionary|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not accurately reflect Gilligan&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; or Daly's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suhonen|first1=Marja|title="Toward Biophilic Be-ing: Mary Daly's Feminist Metaethics and the Question of Essentialism" in Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|date=2000|publisher=Penn State University Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; views.

==Theory==
Difference theory has roots in the studies of [[John Gumperz]], who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, ''A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication'', which itself drew on the work of Gumperz.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, ''Language and Gender: An advanced resource book'', pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Talbot makes reference to the term "gender-specific culture" in her critique of the difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, ''Communication between Men and Women in the Context of the Christian Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', pp. 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Women, Men and Language'', pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the popularity of Tannen's book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', and the resultant popularisation of difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Talbot98"&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in [[genderlect]] by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without "pointing the finger" at anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.&lt;ref name="Talbot98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Deborah Tannen and difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status v. support===
Tannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding v. advice===
Women seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.

===Information v. feelings===
Tannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.

===Orders v. proposals===
Men will use direct imperatives ("close the door", "switch on the light") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however ("let's", "would you mind if ...?").

===Conflict v. compromise===
Tannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of [[Walter J. Ong]], whose 1981 publication, ''Fighting for Life'', asserts that "expressed adversativeness" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence v. intimacy===
Difference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, "Let me consult this with my wife first." Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

General criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12342">{{About|the English personal pronoun|other uses|I (disambiguation)}}
The pronoun '''''I''''' {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is the [[grammatical person|first-person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[nominative case]] [[personal pronoun]] in [[Modern English]].  It is used to refer to one's [[self]] and is [[capitalization|capitalized]], although other pronouns, such as ''he'' or ''she'', are not capitalized.

The grammatical variants of ''I'' are ''me'', ''my'', ''mine'', and ''myself''.

==Etymology==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2015}}
{{Further|Old English pronouns|Proto-Germanic pronouns|Proto-Indo-European pronouns}}
English ''I'' originates from [[Old English]] (OE) ''ic''. Its predecessor ''ic'' had in turn originated from the continuation of [[Proto-Germanic]] *''ik'', and ''ek''; the asterisk denotes an unattested form, ''ek'' was attested in the [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant ''eka''; see also [[ek erilaz]]). Linguists assume ''ik'' to have developed from the unstressed variant of ''ek''. Variants of ''ic'' were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s.{{sfn| OED online}}

Germanic cognates are: [[Old Frisian]] ''ik'', [[Old Norse]] ''ek'' ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''jeg'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''jag'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ég), [[Old High German]] ''ih'' ([[German language|German]] ''[[:wikt:ich|ich]]'') and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''ik'' and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] also "ik".

The Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the [[Proto Indo-European language]] (PIE). The reconstructed PIE pronoun is *''egō, egóm'', with cognates including
[[Sanskrit]] ''aham'', [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''uk'', [[Latin]] ''ego'', [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐγώ}} ''egō'', [[Common Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''azъ'' and [[Alviri-Vidari language|Alviri-Vidari]] (an Iranian language) {{lang|fa|اَز}} ''az''.

The oblique forms are formed from a stem  ''*me-'' (English ''me''), the plural from ''*wei-'' (English ''we''), the oblique plurals from ''*ns-'' (English ''us'') and from Proto-Germanic ''*unseraz'', PIE ''*no-s-ero-'' (''our, ours'').

== Capitalization ==
''I'' (and only this form of the pronoun) is the only pronoun that is always capitalized in English.{{Efn-lr|Other pronouns may be capitalized when referring to the Deity ("God's in His heaven") and, of course, when beginning a sentence. The capitalization of the first person pronoun is distinctive of English, although it is common in other languages to capitalize a second person pronoun, for example ''Sie'' in German.}} This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase ''i'' was sometimes found as late as the 17th century.{{Sfn|Fowler|2015}}

== Case forms ==
{{See also|Objective case#English}}
Like the  other [[English personal pronouns]] ''we'' (''us''), ''he'' (''him''), ''she'' (''her''), and ''they'' (''them''), the pronoun ''I'' has several singular case forms.{{efn-lr |name=Terminology|Terminological note: &lt;br/&gt;Authorities use different terms for the inflectional ([[grammatical case|case]]) forms of the personal pronouns, such as the [[oblique case|oblique-case]] form ''me'', which is used as a direct object, indirect object, or object of a preposition, as well as other uses. For instance, one standard work on English grammar, ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', uses the term ''objective case'', while another, ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]'', uses the term ''accusative'' case. Similarly, some use the term ''nominative'' for the form ''I'', while others use the term ''subjective''. Some authorities use the term ''genitive'' for forms such as ''my'' where others use the term ''possessive''. Some grammars refer to ''my'' and ''mine'', respectively, as the ''dependent genitive'' and the ''independent genitive'', while others call ''my'' a ''possessive adjective'' and ''mine'' a ''possessive pronoun''.}}
These are:{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}} 
* ''I'', the nominative (or subjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form 
* ''me'', the accusative (or objective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''my'', the dependent genitive (or possessive adjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''mine'', the independent genitive case form (or possessive pronoun{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}})

=== Use of ''I'' and ''me'' ===
There are some situations in which only the nominative form (''I'')  is grammatically correct and others in which only the accusative form (''me'')  is correct. There are also situations in which one form is used in informal style (and was often considered ungrammatical by older prescriptive grammars) and the other form is preferred in formal style.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}}

====Exclusive use of nominative ''I''====
In all varieties of standard English, the nominative form ''I'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative|Not part of a  coordinative construction with ''and'', for instance.}} subject of an ''explicit'' verb,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=458-459}} e.g. 
* "I did it."
not 
* * "Me did it."{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk|The asterisk preceding this example indicates that the utterance is not acceptable in standard English. For an explanation of this linguistic convention, see [[Asterisk#Linguistics]]}}
With other pronouns, such as ''we'' (strictly speaking when used as a personal determiner), there may be exceptions to this in some varieties of English.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}

====Exclusive use of accusative ''me''====
In all varieties of standard English, the accusative form ''me'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative}} direct or indirect object{{efn-lr|including the subject of a non-finite clause introduced by ''for'', e.g. "For me to do that would be more than a crime."}} of a verb or preposition.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}  The accusative ''me'' is also required in a number of constructions such as "Silly me!"{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=461–462}}

====Alternative use of nominative and accusative====
In many situations, both the nominative ''I'' and the accusative ''me'' are encountered.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}

When the pronoun is used as a subjective predicative complement, the nominative ''I'' is sometimes encountered in (very)  formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}
* "It is I."
But this is often seen as hypercorrect and may be unacceptable, as in:
* * "This one [photograph] is I as a baby.{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk}}
''Me'' is usually preferred as a subjective predicate, especially in informal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "This is me as a baby." 
* "It's me!"
The nominative ''I'' is more common in this role when it is followed by a relative clause:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "It is I she loves." 
* "It is I who love you." 
though even here ''me'' is more common in non-formal style:
* "It's me she loves." 
* "It's me who loves you."

Following ''as'' or ''than'' (without a following explicit verb),  the accusative form is common:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than me."
However, where it is possible to think of the pronoun as the subject of an implicit verb and ''than'' or ''as'' as a conjunction, the nominative ''I'' is found in formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than I [am]."

In [[Australian English]], [[British English]] and [[Irish English]], many speakers have an unstressed form of ''my'' that is identical to ''me'' (see [[English personal pronouns#Archaic and non-standard forms|archaic and non-standard forms of English personal pronouns]]).

=====Coordinative constructions=====
The above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object.
In some  varieties  English (particularly formal English), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as "you and I".{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} So the correct form is 
* "My husband and I wish you a merry Christmas."
* "Between you and me ..."

In some varieties of non-standard informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative ''subject'' construction,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} as in
* "Phil and me wish you a merry Christmas."
This is highly stigmatized.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462-463}}

On the other hand, the use of the nominative ''I'' in coordinative constructions like "you and I"where ''me'' would be used in a non-coordinative object is less stigmatized – and in some cases so widespread as to be considered a variety of standard English:{{sfn |Huddleston |Pullum |2002 |p=463}} 
* "President Bush graciously invited Michelle and I to meet with him ..."
* "All debts are cleared between you and I".

[[File:Examples of Ibid, from "Justice" by Michael J- Sandel 2013-04-08 20-17.jpg|thumbnail|An example of Ibid. citations in use, from "Justice" by [[Michael J. Sandel]].]]

'''Ibid''' is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:ibidem#Latin|ibīdem]]'', meaning "in the same place", commonly used in an [[endnote]], [[footnote]], [[bibliography]] [[citation]], or [[reference#Scholarship|scholarly reference]] to refer to the [[Source text|source]] cited in the preceding note or list item. This is similar to ''[[wikt:idem#Latin|īdem]]'', literally meaning "the same", abbreviated ''Id.'', which is commonly used in [[legal citation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/idem |title=Idem|publisher=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibid. may also be used in the Harvard (name-date) system for in-text references where there has been a close previous citation from the same source material.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style Online, (13.64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Hart's Rules, Oxford University Press, 2005, p.396&lt;/ref&gt; The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page. Some academic publishers now prefer that "ibid." not be italicized, as it is a commonly found term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/notesforauthors/cambridge_style.doc |title=Style sheet: Cambridge University Press |format=DOC |date=2013 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ibid. is an [[abbreviation]] where the last two letters of the word are omitted, it takes a full stop (period) in both British and American usage.

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[1] E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' (New York: Academic, 1997), 23.
:[2] Ibid.

:[4] A. Alhazred, ''The Necronomicon'' (Petrus de Dacia, 1994).
:[5] Ibid. 1, 34.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reference 2 is the same as reference 1: E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' on page 23, whereas reference 3 refers to the same work but at a different location, namely page 29. Intervening entries require a reference to the original citation in the form Ibid. &lt;citation #&gt;, as in reference 5.

==Cultural references==

* Ibid. is used in the 1960s play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' by [[Edward Albee]]. Albee uses an unabbreviated ibid{{huh|date=April 2017}} in his stage directions to tell an actor to use the same tone as the previous line.

Something that is '''impredicative''', in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], is a [[self reference|self-referencing]] [[definition]]. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.

The opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratified]] (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is [[intuitionistic type theory]], which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.

[[Russell's paradox]] is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The [[paradox]] is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be  asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.

The [[greatest lower bound]] of a set {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|glb({{var|X}})}}, also has an impredicative definition: {{math|1={{var|y}} = glb({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and any {{math|{{var|z}}}} less than or equal to all elements of {{math|{{var|X}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|y}}}}. This definition quantifies over the set (potentially [[infinite set|infinite]], depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, one of which being the glb itself. Hence '''predicativism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would reject this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

|source={{harv|Russell|1907|loc=p.34}} (Russell used "norm" to mean a proposition: roughly something that can take the values "true" or "false".)
}}

The terms "predicative" and "impredicative" were introduced by {{harvtxt|Russell|1907}}, though the meaning has changed a little since then. 

[[Solomon Feferman]] provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vicious circle principle]] was suggested by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905-6, 1908)&lt;ref&gt;dates derived from Kleene 1952:42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called ''impredicative''.

The first modern paradox appeared with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]]'s 1897 ''A question on transfinite numbers''&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) ''A question on transfinite numbers'' in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) ''Letter to Dedekind'' in van Heijenoort 1967:113&lt;/ref&gt; and would become known as the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) "naive" set theory and this become known as [[Cantor's paradox]]. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's ''Lettern to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; with his reading of [[Frege]]'s treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:
{{quote|On the other hand, it may be also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' in van Heijenoort 1967:23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, given {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} the function {{math|{{var|f}}}} is the variable and {{math|{{var|a}}}} is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} for {{math|{{var|f}}}} itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:
{{quote|You state ... that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let {{math|{{var|w}}}} be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can {{math|{{var|w}}}} be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. There we must conclude that {{math|{{var|w}}}} is not a predicate. Likewise, there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell's 1902 ''Letter to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124-125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:
{{quote|Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that "The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in ''The principles of mathematics'' (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...".&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by "propounding his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a ''predicative'' function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments".&lt;ref&gt;Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;/ref&gt; But this "axiom" was met with resistance from all quarters.

The rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the [[natural number]]s as classically understood) leads to the position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as predicativism, advocated by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in his ''Das Kontinuum''. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.

[[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 "A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering"{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}} presents an entire section "b. ''Objection concerning nonpredicative definition''" where he argued against "Poincaré (1906, p.&amp;nbsp;307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt; He gives two examples of impredicative definitions &amp;ndash; (i) the notion of [[Dedekind chain]]s and (ii) "in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers {{math|{{var|Z}}}} is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190–191&lt;/ref&gt; He ends his section with the following observation: "A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:191&lt;/ref&gt;

Zermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of [[Least upper bound]] in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 ''Das Kontinuum'' (''The Continuum'') to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the "theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set {{math|M}} of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] argued that "impredicative" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of "tallest person in the room" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: {{math|1={{var|y}} = min({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and {{math|{{var|y}}}} is in {{math|{{var|X}}}}.

Burgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of [[Frege]]'s logic, [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second order arithmetic]], and [[axiomatic set theory]].

(ibid). Weyl in his 1918 ("Das Kontinuum") attempted to derive as much of analysis as was possible without the use of impredicative definitions, "but not the theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set M of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (CF. also Weyl 1919)" (p.&amp;nbsp;43).

He claims to show methods for eliminating the "paradoxes of syntax" ("logical paradoxes") — by use of the theory of types — and  "the paradoxes of semantics" — by the use of metalanguage (his "theory of levels of language"). He attributes the suggestion of this notion to Russell and more concretely to Ramsey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">'''KWIC''' is an acronym for '''Key Word In Context''', the most common format for [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] lines. The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D., Schütze, H.: "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", p.35. The MIT Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on a concept called ''keyword in titles'' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrea%20Crestadoro&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''KWIC''' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.

For example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article ("KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines") and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English ("the free encyclopedia"), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a ''permuted index''.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/kwic/web/theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a '''permuted index''' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as '''KWOC''' (“'''Key Word Out of Context'''”), is no longer common.

This format is extremely useful in that the keyword is easily identified together with its context. ... The Concordance of the Roman Missal is produced in both the KWIC and KWICn formats and is noteworthy in that each word form is listed as it appears in the text, that is, it is un-lemmatized."

'''Leslie Gilbert Pine''' (22 December 1907 – 15 May 1987) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]], [[lecturer]], and researcher in the areas of [[genealogy]], [[nobility]], history, [[heraldry]] and [[animal welfare]].{{ref|ancestry3}}  He was born in 1907 in [[Bristol]], [[England]] and died in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]] in 1987.  He was the son of Lilian Grace Beswetherick and Henry Moorshead Pine (a tea merchant).{{ref|ancestry1}}

From 1935 to 1940 he served as an assistant [[editing|editor]] at [[Burke's Peerage]] Ltd. During [[World War II]] he was an officer in the [[Royal Air Force]] intelligence branch, serving in [[North Africa]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[India]]; he retired with the rank of Squadron Leader. After the war and until 1960, he was Burke's executive director. Pine edited ''Burke's Peerage,'' 1949-1959; ''Burke's Landed Gentry (of Great Britain),'' 1952; ''Burke's Landed Gentry (of Ireland),'' 1958; and, ''Burke's Distinguished Families of America,'' 1939, 1947.  He also edited ''The International Year Book and Statesmen's Who's Who,'' 1953-1960; ''Author's and Writer's Who's Who,'' 1948, 1960; ''Who's Who in Music,'' 1949; and, ''Who's Who in the Free Churches,'' 1951.{{ref|pine1}}

A graduate of London University, he became a Barrister-at-Law, Inner Temple, in 1953. Pine was a member of the International Institute of Genealogy and Heraldry, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, a Fellow of the Ancient Monuments Society, a Life Fellow of the Institute of Journalists, a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]], and a Liveryman of the Glaziers' Company.  In [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]] he was the unsuccessful [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Bristol Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol Central]].

He was managing editor of a British hunting magazine, ''[[Shooting Times]]'', from 1960 to 1964.{{ref|Times1}} He later authored an important book highly critical of [[sport hunting]], ''After Their Blood'', in which he wrote: "It is our duty as men and women of God’s redeemed creation to try not to increase the suffering of the world, but to lessen it. To get rid of bloodsports will be a great step toward this end."

In 1948 Leslie Pine married Grace V. Griffin (20 August 1914- ). Their only child, [[Richard Pine]], was born in London on 21 August 1949.

The '''Museum of Comparative Zoology''', full name "The Louis Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology", often abbreviated simply to "MCZ", is the [[zoology]] museum located on the grounds of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. It is one of three natural history research museums at Harvard whose public face is the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]]. Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating display at the public museum.  The current director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is [[James Hanken]], the Louis Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University.

Many of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest but also historical significance. Past exhibits have included a [[fossil]] [[sand dollar]] which was found by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1834, Captain Cook's [[mamo]], and two [[pheasant]]s that once belonged to [[George Washington]], now on loan to Mount Vernon in Virginia.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is physically connected to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]]; for visitors, one admission ticket grants access to both museums. The research collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology are not open to the public.

==History==
The Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist [[Louis Agassiz]], and the museum used to be referred to as "The Agassiz" after its founder.&lt;ref&gt;Winsor, Mary P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w6vLeToUzHEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reading+the+shape+of+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qvSLpLfZAhWFPN8KHUbnBN4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reading%20the%20shape%20of%20nature&amp;f=false Reading the Shape of Nature: Comparative Zoology at the Agassiz Museum] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and [[Comparative anatomy|comparative relationships]] of [[animal]] life.

The [[Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory]] was created in 1894 when [[Radcliffe College]] rented a space on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/1468-0424.12292/abstract|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.12292/epdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.

The museum comprises twelve departments: [[Biological Oceanography]], [[Entomology]], [[Herpetology]], [[Ichthyology]], [[Invertebrate paleontology|Invertebrate Paleontology]], [[Invertebrate zoology|Invertebrate Zoology]], [[Mammalogy]], [[Marine invertebrates]], [[Malacology]], [[Ornithology]], [[Population Genetics]], and [[Vertebrate Paleontology]].  The [[Ernst Mayr|Ernst Mayr Library]] and its archives join in supporting the work of the museum.  The Ernst Mayr Library is a founding member of the [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org Biodiversity Heritage Library].

==Publications==
The museum publishes two journals: the ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College'', first published in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/2803|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Breviora'', first published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breviora|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/3989|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
In contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of [[taxidermy|stuffed animals]] on display, from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.  Notable exhibits include [[whale]] [[skeleton]]s, the largest [[turtle]] [[Animal shell|shell]] ever found (eight feet long), "the Harvard [[mastodon]]", a {{convert|42|ft|m|sing=on}} long ''[[Kronosaurus]]'' skeleton, the skeleton of a [[dodo]], and a [[coelacanth]] preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

New and changing exhibitions in the Harvard Museum of Natural History include "Evolution" (2008); "The Language of Color" (2008 to 2013); "Arthropods: Creatures that Rule" (2006); "New England Forests" (2011); and "Mollusks: Shelled Masters of the Marine Realm" (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10820">'''Non-well-founded set theories''' are variants of [[axiomatic set theory]] that allow sets to contain themselves and otherwise violate the rule of [[well-foundedness]]. In non-well-founded set theories, the [[axiom of regularity|foundation axiom]] of [[ZFC]] is replaced by axioms implying its negation.

The study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an [[axiom]]. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until [[Peter Aczel]]’s [[hyperset theory]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Pakkan and Akman (1994, [http://tinf2.vub.ac.be/~dvermeir/mirrors/www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/%257Eakman/jour-papers/air/node8.html section link]); Rathjen (2004); Sangiorgi (2011) pp. 17–19, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the [[logic]]al [[model (abstract)|modelling]] of non-terminating [[Computing|computational]] processes in computer science ([[process algebra]] and [[final semantics]]), [[linguistics]] and [[natural language]] [[semantics]] ([[situation theory]]), philosophy (work on the [[Liar Paradox]]), and in a different setting, [[non-standard analysis]].{{sfnp|Ballard|Hrbáček|1992|p=}}

== Details ==
In 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;68; Hallett (1986), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TM3AKPYdQVgC&amp;pg=PA186 p.&amp;nbsp;186]; Aczel (1988) p. 105 all citing Mirimanoff (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of [[well-founded set|well-foundedness]] of a set:

:A set, x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is well-founded if it has no infinite descending membership sequence &lt;math&gt; \cdots \in x_2 \in x_1 \in x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

In ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the [[axiom of regularity]]. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the ''foundation axiom'' since it can be proved within ZFC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the [[axiom of regularity]], the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set ''A'' such that ''A'' ∈ ''A'' is non-well-founded.

Although Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (1988) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Paul Finsler]] introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of [[von Neumann]] 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=107}} An early non-well-founded set theory was [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]’s [[New Foundations]], although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.

Several proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by [[Paul Bernays]] (1954), following an announcement of the result in earlier paper of his from 1941, and by [[Ernst Specker]] who gave a different proof in his [[Habilitationsschrift]] of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 [[Rieger's theorem]] was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=107–108}} The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of [[Dana Scott]] (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called [[Anti-Foundation Axiom|SAFA]].{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=108–109}} Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was [[Maurice Boffa]]'s axiom of [[superuniversality]], described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=110}} Boffa's idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa's axiom implies that every [[extensionality|extensional]] [[binary relation|set-like]] relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.

A more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a [[bisimulation]]. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the [[axiom of extensionality]]. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as '''anti-foundation axioms''', and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a '''hyperset'''.

Four mutually [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:
# '''A'''FA ("Anti-Foundation Axiom") – due to M. Forti and F. Honsell (this is also known as [[Aczel's anti-foundation axiom]]);
# '''S'''AFA ("Scott’s AFA") – due to [[Dana Scott]],
# '''F'''AFA ("Finsler’s AFA") – due to [[Paul Finsler]],
# '''B'''AFA ("Boffa’s AFA") – due to [[Maurice Boffa]].
They essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on [[accessible pointed graph]]s (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg.  Within this framework, it can be shown that the so-called [[Quine atom]], formally defined by Q={Q}, exists and is unique.

Each of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: [[Von Neumann universe|V]] ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.&lt;ref&gt;Nitta, Okada, Tsouvaras (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.

== Applications ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Aczel’s hypersets were extensively used by [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]] in their 1987 book ''The Liar'', on the [[liar's paradox]]; The book is also good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.

Boffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic [[nonstandard analysis]].{{sfnp|Kanovei|Reeken|2004|p=303}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10235">A '''numeronym''' is a number-based word.

Most commonly, a numeronym is a word where a number is used to form an [[abbreviation]] (albeit not an [[acronym]] or an [[initialism]]). Pronouncing the letters and numbers may sound similar to the full word: "K9" for "[[dog|canine]]" (phonetically: "kay" + "nine").

Alternatively, the letters between the first and last are replaced with a number representing the number of letters omitted, such as "i18n" for "[[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]]".  Sometimes the last letter is also counted and omitted.  These word shortenings are sometimes called ''alphanumeric acronyms'', ''alphanumeric abbreviations'', or ''numerical contractions''.

According to Tex Texin, the first numeronym of this kind was "S12n", the [[electronic mail]] account name given to [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) employee Jan Scherpenhuizen by a [[system administrator]] because his [[surname]] was too long to be an account name. By 1985, colleagues who found Jan's name unpronounceable often referred to him verbally as "S12n" (''ess-twelve-en''). The use of such numeronyms became part of DEC corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://www.i18nguy.com/origini18n.html  |author=Tex Texin  |title=Origin Of The Abbreviation I18n  |work=  |accessdate=September 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number may also denote how many times the character before or after it is repeated. This is typically used to represent a name or phrase in which several consecutive words start with the same letter, as in [[World Wide Web|W3]] ([[World Wide Web]]) or [[W3C]] ([[World Wide Web Consortium]]).

Some numeronyms are composed entirely of numbers, such as "[[Area code 212|212]]" for "[[New York City|New York]]er", "[[4-1-1]]" for "information", "[[9-1-1]]" for "help", and "[[101 (term)|101]]" for "basic introduction to a subject". Words of this type have existed for decades, including those in [[10-code]], which has been in use since before [[World War II]].

Chapter or title numbers of some jurisdictions' statutes have become numeronyms, for example [[5150 (involuntary psychiatric hold)|5150]] and [[187 (slang)|187]] from California's penal code. Largely because the production of many American movies and television programs are based in California, usage of these terms has spread beyond its original location and user population.

The concept of incorporating numbers into words can also be found in [[Leet|Leet-speak]], where numbers are frequently substituted for orthographically similar letters (e.g. ''H4CK3D'' for ''HACKED'').

Anne H. Soukhanov, editor of the new ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary]]'', gives the original meaning of the term as "a telephone number that spells a word or a name" on a [[rotary dial|telephone dial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Self-perpetuation''', the capability of something to cause itself to continue to [[existence|exist]], is one of the main characteristics of [[life]]. [[Organism]]s' capability of [[reproduction]] leads to self-perpetuation of the species, if not to the individual. [[Population]]s self-perpetuate and grow. Entire [[ecosystem]]s show [[homeostasis]], and thus perpetuate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hilgardia|volume=39|issue=13|pages=367–404|doi=10.3733/hilg.v39n13p367|year=1968|title=Mechanisms of population homeostasis in Anagasta ecosystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Population homeostasis
|author=Koeslag JH.
|journal=S Afr Med J
|year=1978
|volume=53
|issue=6
|pages=222–4.
|pmid=653514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slow modifying effect of [[succession (ecology)|succession]] and similar shifts in the composition of the system can, however, not be neglected in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ecol. Appl. |year=2015 |volume=25|issue=8|pages=2051–68|title=The rise of novelty in ecosystems|pmid=26910939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, life's object's capabilities of self-perpetuation are always accompanied by [[evolution]], a perfect [[steady state]] of the biological system is never reached. [[Sexual reproduction]] is also a form of imperfect [[self-replication]] and thus imperfect self-perpetuation because of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] and [[mutation]]. Organisms are not like [[self-replicating machine]] but amass random modifications from generation to generation. The property of self-perpetuation in the strict sense thus only applies to life itself.

In a social context, self-perpetuation is tied to [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] and (usually) [[positive feedback]] loops:
{{quote|To overcome strong prior [[beliefs]], strong evidence to the contrary is needed. If a person is predisposed to choosing a certain action, the advice from an advisor who sets a low threshold for recommending the alternative action is not of much use. The preference for like-minded advisors who supply coarse information implies that the advice a person receives is likely to
reinforce his existing [[priors]]. This effect can lead to polarisation of opinion and the [[emergence]] of self-serving beliefs. The learning process is prolonged and the induced short run bias can become perpetual if information is costly|Wing Suen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The Self-Perpetuation of Biased Beliefs
|author=Wing Suen
|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Depending on the time scope or the context, self-perpetuation either depends on [[self-sustainability]], or is equivalent to it. While we may talk about the self-sustainability of an ecosystem, this depends amongst other factor on the self-perpetuation of its constituting species.

In computer science, [[self-reproducing program]]s constitute an incomplete metaphor for self-perpetuation. A better analogue can be seen in [[computer virus]]es which are actually able to self-reproduce - given a suitable computing environment.

&lt;!-- Note to anyone who is thinking of making this article self referential: Please do not do this, see the note at top of the recursion article for why --&gt;{{Selfref|For the self-reference template on Wikipedia, see [[Template:Selfref]].}}

[[Image:ouroboros.png|thumb|The [[Ouroboros]], a dragon that continually consumes itself, is used as a symbol for self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soto-Andrade |first1=Jorge |last2=Jaramillo |first2=Sebastian |last3=Gutierrez |first3=Claudio |last4=Letelier |first4=Juan-Carlos |title=Ouroboros avatars: A mathematical exploration of Self-reference and Metabolic Closure |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/alife/0262297140chap115.pdf |publisher=MIT Press |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Self-reference''' occurs in [[natural language|natural]] or [[formal language|formal languages]] when a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], idea or [[formula]] refers to itself. The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some [[Semantics encoding|encoding]]. In [[philosophy]], it also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself: to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun, [[I (pronoun)|the word "I"]] in English.

Self-reference is studied and has applications in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[computer programming]], and [[linguistics]]. Self-referential statements are sometimes [[paradox]]ical, and can also be considered [[Recursion|recursive]].

==In logic, mathematics and computing ==
In classical [[philosophy]], [[paradoxes]] were created by self-referential concepts such as the [[omnipotence paradox]] of asking if it was possible for a being to exist so powerful that it could create a stone that it could not lift. The [[Epimenides paradox]], 'All Cretans are liars' when uttered by an ancient Greek Cretan was one of the first recorded versions. Contemporary philosophy sometimes employs the same technique to demonstrate that a supposed concept is meaningless or ill-defined.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[computability theory]], self-reference (also known as [[Impredicativity]]) is the key concept in proving limitations of many systems. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] uses it to show that no formal consistent system of mathematics can ever contain all possible mathematical truths, because it cannot prove some truths about its own structure. [[The halting problem]] equivalent, in computation theory, shows that there is always some task that a computer cannot perform, namely reasoning about itself. These proofs relate to a long tradition of mathematical paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Berry's paradox]], and ultimately to classical philosophical paradoxes.

In [[game theory]] undefined behaviors can occur where two players must model each other's mental states and behaviors, leading to infinite regress.

In [[computer programming]], self-reference occurs in [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]], where a program can read or modify its own instructions like any other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malenfant|first1=J.|last2=Demers|first2=F-N|title=A Tutorial on Behavioral Reflection and its Implementation|url=http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/projects/reflection96/docs/malenfant/malenfant.pdf|publisher=PARC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous programming languages support reflection to some extent with varying degrees of expressiveness. Additionally, self-reference is seen in [[recursion]] (related to the mathematical [[recurrence relation]]) in [[functional programming]], where a code structure refers back to itself during computation.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker |first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Taming' self-reference from potentially paradoxical concepts into well-behaved recursions has been one of the great successes of [[computer science]], and is now used routinely in, for example, writing [[compilers]] using the 'meta-language' [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Using a compiler to compile itself is known as [[bootstrapping]]. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible to write (programs which operate on themselves), both with [[Assembly language|assembler]] and with functional languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], but is generally discouraged in real-world programming. Computing hardware makes fundamental use of self-reference in [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], the basic units of digital memory, which convert potentially paradoxical logical self-relations into memory by expanding their terms over time. Thinking in terms of self-reference is a pervasive part of programmer culture, with many programs and acronyms named self-referentially as a form of humor, such as [[GNU]] ('Gnu's not Unix') and [[PINE]] ('Pine is not Elm'). The [[GNU Hurd]] is named for a pair of mutually self-referential acronyms.

[[Tupper's self-referential formula]] is a mathematical curiosity which plots an image of its own formula.

== In life ==
The biology of [[self-replication]] is self-referential, as embodied by [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] replication mechanisms. Models of self-replication are found in the computational [[Game of life]], and have inspired engineering systems such as the [[RepRap]] self-replicating 3d printer.

== In art ==
Self-reference occurs in [[literature]] and [[film]] when an author refers to his or her own work in the context of the work itself. Examples include [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'', [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[If on a winter's night a traveler]]'', many stories by [[Nikolai Gogol]], ''[[Lost in the Funhouse]]'' by [[John Barth]], [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' and [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]''. Perhaps the earliest example is in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]], where [[Helen of Troy]] laments: "for generations still unborn/we will live in song" (appearing in the song itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |others=Translated by Robert Fagles |title=Iliad |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=1-101-15281-8 |page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reference in art is closely related to the concepts of [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and [[meta-reference]], which often involve self-reference. The short stories of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] play with self-reference and related paradoxes in many ways. [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Krapp's Last Tape]] consists entirely of the protagonist listening to and making recordings of himself, mostly about other recordings. During the 1990s and 2000s filmic self-reference was a popular part of the [[rubber reality]] movement, notably in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s films [[Being John Malkovich]] and [[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]], the latter pushing the concept arguably to its breaking point as it attempts to portray its own creation.

Various [[creation myths]] invoke self-reference to solve the problem of what created the creator. For example the [[Egyptian creation myth]] has a god swallowing his own semen to create himself. [[Ouroboros]] is a mythical dragon which eats itself.

The [[surrealist]] painter [[René Magritte]] is famous for his self-referential works. His painting ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'', includes the words "this is not a pipe", the truth of which depends entirely on whether the word ''ceci'' (in English, "this") refers to the pipe depicted&amp;mdash;or to the painting or the word or sentence itself.&lt;ref name="NöthBishara2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nöth |first1=Winfried |last2=Bishara |first2=Nina |title=Self-reference in the Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBOFIdchEQYC&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2007 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019464-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M.C. Escher]]'s art also contains many self-referential concepts such as hands drawing themselves.

== In language ==
A word that describes itself is called an ''[[autological word]]'' (or ''[[autological word|autonym]]''). This generally applies to adjectives, for example [[wikt:sesquipedalian|sesquipedalian]] (i.e. "sesquipedalian" is a sesquipedalian word), but can also apply to other parts of speech, such as [[wikt:TLA|TLA]], as a three-letter [[abbreviation]] for "[[three-letter abbreviation]]".

A sentence which inventories its own letters and punctuation marks is called an [[autogram]].

There is a special case of meta-sentence in which the content of the sentence in the metalanguage and the content of the sentence in the object language are the same. Such a sentence is referring to itself. However some meta-sentences of this type can lead to paradoxes. "This is a sentence." can be considered to be a self-referential meta-sentence which is obviously true. However "This sentence is false" is a meta-sentence which leads to a self-referential [[Liar paradox|paradox]]. Such sentences can lead to problems, for example, in law, where statements bringing laws into existence can contradict one another or themselves. [[Kurt Gödel]] claimed to have found such a paradox in the [[US constitution]] at his citizenship ceremony.

Self-reference occasionally occurs in the [[Broadcast media|media]] when it is required to write about itself, for example the [[BBC]] reporting on job cuts at the BBC. Notable encyclopedias may be required to feature articles about themselves, such as [[Wikipedia]]'s article on Wikipedia.

[[Fumblerules]] are a list of rules of good grammar and writing, demonstrated through sentences that violate those very rules, such as "Avoid cliches like the plague" and "Don't use no double negatives". The term was coined in a published list of such rules by [[William Safire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-usage-english.org/humorousrules.html alt.usage.english.org's ''Humorous Rules for Writing'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = William |last= Safire |authorlink=William Safire |publication-date=1979-11-04 |title=On Language; The Fumblerules of Grammar |periodical=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/on-language-the-fumblerules-of-grammar.html?sq=Fumblerules&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p |page=SM4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In meta-disciplines ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Several academic disciplines are sometime required to study themselves in forms of self-reference, for example [[historiography]] (or "[[meta-history]]") is history's study of its own past; [[meta-sociology]] occurs when sociologists study the power structures in their own academic institutions; and [[meta-mathematics]] is the study of mathematics itself as a formal system, using its own methods. In [[law]], self-reference may become an issue when laws are required to regulate the making of new laws, especially around [[constitutional]] issues. (The game of [[nomic]] begins as a model of this process.) The prefix "[[meta]]" is often used to denote this type of self-reference.

==In popular culture==
* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s books, especially ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' and ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', play with many self-referential concepts and were highly influential in bringing them into mainstream intellectual culture during the 1980s. [[Hofstadter's law]], which specifies that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law"&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]]. ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''. 20th anniversary ed., 1999, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a self-referencing adage. Hofstadter also suggested the concept of a 'Reviews of this book', a book containing only reviews of itself, which has since been implemented using [[wiki|wikis]] and other technologies. Hofstadter's '[[strange loop]]' [[metaphysics]] attempts to map [[consciousness]] onto self-reference, but is a minority position in [[philosophy of mind]].
* The subgenre of "[[recursion|recursive]] [[science fiction]]" or [[metafiction]] is now so extensive that it has fostered a fan-maintained bibliography at the [[New England Science Fiction Association]]'s website; some of it is about [[science-fiction fandom]], some about science fiction and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesfa.org/Recursion/index.htm "Recursive Science Fiction"] New England Science Fiction Association website, last updated 3 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54392">Every day, people are presented with endless amounts of information, and in an effort to help keep track and organize this information, people must be able to recognize, differentiate and store information. One way to do that is to [[information organization|organize information]] as it pertains to the self.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35''(9), 677-688. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.677&lt;/ref&gt; The overall concept of [[self-reference]] suggests that people interpret incoming information in relation to themselves, using their [[self-concept]] as a background for new information.&lt;ref name = "source1" /&gt;  Examples include being able to attribute [[personality traits]] to oneself or to identify [[recollection|recollected]] episodes as being personal memories of the past.&lt;ref name="source6"&gt;Benoit, R. G., Gilbert, S. J., Volle, E., &amp; Burgess, P. W. (2010). When I think about me and simulate you: Medial rostral prefrontal cortex and self-referential processes. ''Neuroimage, 50''(3), 1340-1349. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.091&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of self-referential processing are evident in many psychological phenomena. For example, the "[[cocktail party effect]]" notes that people attend to the sound of their names even during other conversation or more prominent, distracting noise. Also, people tend to evaluate things related to themselves more positively (This is thought to be an aspect of [[implicit self-esteem]]). For example, people tend to prefer their [[Implicit self-esteem#Name.E2.80.93letter effect|own initials]] over other letters.&lt;ref name="source8"&gt;Heatherton, T. F., Macrae, C., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2004). What the social brain sciences can tell us about the self. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13''(5), 190-193. doi:10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00305.x&lt;/ref&gt; The [[self-reference effect]] (SRE) has received the most attention through investigations into memory. The concepts of '''self-referential encoding''' and the SRE rely on the notion that relating information to the self during the process of encoding it in memory facilitates recall, hence the effect of self-reference on memory. In essence, researchers have investigated the potential [[mnemonic]] properties of self-reference.&lt;ref name="source5"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56''(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.853&lt;/ref&gt;

Research includes investigations into [[self-schema]], [[self-concept]] and [[self-awareness]] as providing the foundation for self-reference's role in [[memory]]. Multiple explanations for the self-reference effect in memory exist, leading to a debate about the underlying processes involved in the self-reference effect. In addition, through the exploration of the self-reference effect, other psychological concepts have been discovered or supported, including [[#Simulation theory|simulation theory]] and the [[#Expansion of the SRE: group reference|group reference]] effect.
After researchers developed a concrete understanding of the self-reference effect, many expanded their investigations to consider the self-reference effect in particular groups like those with [[#Autism spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorder]]s or those experiencing [[#Depression|depression]].

==Self-concept and self-schema==
Self-knowledge can be categorized by structures in memory or [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]]. A [[self-schema]] is a set of facts or beliefs that one has about themselves.&lt;ref name="source14"&gt;Katz, A. N. (1987). Self-reference in the encoding of creative-relevant traits.

For example, people who think of themselves as very overweight or who identify themselves to a greater extent based on their body weight would be considered "schematic" on the attribute of body weight. Thus, many everyday events, such as going out for a meal or discussing a friend's eating habits, could induce thoughts about the self.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., Hamill, R., &amp; Sentis, K. P. (1987).

Thus, the self-schema is an aspect of oneself that is used as an encoding structure that brings upon memory of information consistent with one's self-schema.&lt;ref name="source16"&gt;Mills, C. J. (1983). Sex-typing and self-schemata effects on memory and response latency. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45''(1), 163-172. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.45.1.163&lt;/ref&gt; Memories that are elaborate and well encoded are usually the result of self-referent correlations during the process of remembering. During the process of encoding, trait representations are encoded in long term memory either directly or indirectly. When they are directly encoded, it is in terms of relating to the self, and when it is indirectly encoded it is done through spouts of episodic information instead of information about the self.&lt;ref name = "source14"/&gt;

Self-schema is often used as somewhat of a database for encoding personal data.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; The self-schema is also used by paying selective attention to outside information and internalizing that information more deeply in one's memory depending on how much that information relates to their schema.&lt;ref name = "source12"/&gt; When self-schema is engaged, traits that go along with one's view of themselves are better remembered and [[Recall (memory)|recalled]].  These traits are also often recalled much better when processed with respect to the self. Similarly, items that are encoded with the self are based on one's self-schema.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Processing the information should balance out when recalled for individuals who have a self-schema that goes along with the information.&lt;ref name = "source16"/&gt;

Self-schemas do not necessarily only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: the personal self, the relational self, and the collective self. The personal self deals with individual level characteristics, the relational self deals with intimate relationship partners, and the collective self deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university).&lt;ref name="source31"&gt;Johnson, C., Gadon, O., Carlson, D., Southwick, S., Faith, M., &amp; Chalfin, J. (2002). Self-reference and group membership: Evidence for a group-reference effect. ''European Journal of Social Psychology, 32''(2), 261-274. doi:10.1002/ejsp.83&lt;/ref&gt; Information that is related to any type of self-schema, including group-related knowledge structures facilitates memory.

In order for the self to be an effective encoding mechanism, it must be a uniform, consistent, well-developed schema. It has been shown that identity exploration leads to the development of self-knowledge which facilitates self-judgments. Identity exploration led to shorter decision times, higher confidence ratings and more intrusions in memory tasks.&lt;ref name="ego"&gt;Dunkel, C. S. (2005). Ego-identity and the Processing of Self-relevant Information . Self and Identity, 349-359&lt;/ref&gt; Previous researchers hypothesized that words compatible with a person's self-schema are easily accessible in memory and are more likely than incompatible words to intrude on a schema-irrelevant memory task. In one experiment, when participants were asked to decide if certain adjectives were "like me" or "not like me," they made the decisions faster when the words were compatible with their self-schema.&lt;ref name="behavior"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Strube, M., Berry, J. M., Lott, C., Fogelman, R., Steinhart, G., Moergen, S., &amp; Davison, L. (1986). Self-schematic representation of the Type A and B behavior patterns. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''51''(1), 170-180. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.170&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the existence of the self-reference effect when considering schemata consistent adjectives, the connection between the self and memory can lead to a larger number of mistakes in recognition, commonly referred to as false alarms. Rogers et al. (1979) found that people are more likely to falsely recognize adjectives they had previously designated to be self-descriptive.&lt;ref name = "ego"/&gt; Expanding on this, Strube et al. (1986) found that false alarms occurred more for self-schema consistent content, presumably because the presence of such words in the schema makes them more accessible in memory.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

In addition to investigating the self-reference effect in regards to schemata consistent information, Strube et al. discussed how counter schemata information relates to this framework. They noted that the pattern of making correct decisions more rapidly did not hold when considering words that countered a person's self-schema, presumably because they were difficult to integrate into memory due to lack of a preexisting structure.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt; That is, they lacked the organizational structure of encoding because they did not fall into the "like me" category, and elaboration would not work because prior connections to the adjective did not exist.

===Self-awareness and personality===
Two of the most common functions of the self receiving significant attention in research are the self-acting to organize the individual's understanding of the social environment, and the self functioning to regulate behavior through self-evaluation.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;Hull, J. G., &amp; Levy, A. S. (1979). The organizational functions of the self: An alternative to the Duval and Wicklund Model of self-awareness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37''(5), 756-768. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.37.5.756&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of self-awareness is considered to be the foundational principle for both functions of the self. Some research presents self-awareness in terms of self-focused attention &lt;ref&gt;Duval, S., &amp; Wicklund, R. A. (1972). ''A theory of objective self-awareness.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness refers to the encoding of information based on its relevance to the self.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Based on the latter interpretation of self-awareness, individuals must identify the aspects of situations that are relevant to themselves and their behavior will be shaped accordingly.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness corresponds to the encoding of information cued by self-symbolic stimuli, and examine the idea of self-awareness as a method of encoding. They structured an investigation that examined self-referent encoding in individuals with different levels of self-awareness, predicting that individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness would encode self-relevant information more deeply than other information, and that they would encode it more deeply than individuals with low levels of self-consciousness.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The results of their investigation supported their hypothesis that self-focused attention is not enough to explain the role of self-awareness on attribution. Their results suggest that self-awareness leads to increased sensitivity to the situationally defined meanings of behavior, and therefore organizes the individual's understanding of the social environment.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The research presented by Hull and Levy led to future research on the encoding of information associated with self-awareness.

In later research, Hull and colleagues examined the associations between self-referential encoding, self-consciousness and the extent to which a stimulus is consistent with self-knowledge. They first assumed that the encoding of a stimulus is facilitated if an individual's working memory already contains information consistent with the stimulus, and suggested that self-consciousness as an encoding mechanism relies on an individual's self-knowledge.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Hull, J. G., Van Treuren, R. R., Ashford, S. J., Propsom, P., &amp; Andrus, B. W. (1988). Self-consciousness and the processing of self-relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54''(3), 452-465. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.452&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that situational and dispositional factors may activate certain pools of knowledge, moving them into working memory, and guiding the processing of certain stimulus information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In order to better understand the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence "The robber took the money from the bank".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1983). ''The architecture of cognition.'' Cambridge. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings in the context of this sentence (monetary institution and river shore). However, the monetary institution meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the monetary institution definition for bank into working memory.  Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In reference to self-consciousness and self-reference, the connection between self-consciousness and self-referent encoding relies on such information activation. Research suggests that self-consciousness activates knowledge relating to the self, thereby guiding the processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; Three experiments conducted by Hull and colleagues provided evidence that a manipulation of accessible self-knowledge impacts self-referent encoding based on the self-relevance of such information, individual differences in the accessibility of self-knowledge (self-consciousness) impacts perception, and a mediation relationship exists between self-consciousness and individual differences in self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

Similar to how self-awareness impacts the availability of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, through the development of the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A and Type B behavior patterns]], focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type A individuals were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

==Theoretical background==
Influential psychologists [[Fergus Craik|Craik]] and Lockhart laid the groundwork for research focused on self-referential encoding and memory. In 1972 they proposed their Depth of Processing framework which suggests that memory retention depends on how the stimulus material was encoded in memory.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, F. I. M., &amp; Lockhart, R. S. (1972).'' ''Levels of processing: A framework for memory research. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 11''(6), 671-684. [[doi:10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X|doi: 10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Kihlstrom, J. F. (1986). Elaboration, organization, and the self-reference effect in memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 115''(1), 26-38. doi:10.1037/0096-3445.115.1.26&lt;/ref&gt; Their original research considered structural, phonemic, and [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding tasks, and showed that semantic encoding is the best method to aid in recall. They asked participants to rate 40 descriptive [[adjectives]] on one of four tasks; Structural (Big font or small font?), Phonemic (Rhymes with xxx?), Semantic (Means same as xxx?), or Self-reference (Describes you?). This was then followed by an "incidental recall task". This is where participants are asked, without prior warning, to recall as many of the words they had seen as possible within a given time limit. Craik and Tulving's original experiment showed that structural and [[phonemic]] tasks lead only to "shallow" encoding, while the semantic tasks lead to "deep" encoding and resulted in better recall.&lt;ref&gt;Craik F., &amp; Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104,'' 268-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1977, it was shown that self-relevant or self-descriptive encoding leads to even better recall than semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Experts suggest that the call on [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]] required by semantic tasks is what provides the advantage over structural or phonemic tasks, but is not enough to surpass the benefit provided by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field &lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words. They then had to select the group of 42 "revisited" words out of the total original list. The researchers argued that if the "self" was involved in memory retrieval, participants would incorrectly recognize words that were more self-descriptive &lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; In another experiment, subjects answered yes or no to cue questions about 40 adjective in 4 tasks (structural, phonemic, semantic and self-referential) and later had to recall the adjectives. This experiment validated the strength of self-reference as an encoding method, and indicated it developed a stronger memory trace than the semantic task.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt;

Researchers are implementing a new strategy by developing different encoding tasks that enhance memory very similarly to self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Symons (1990) had findings that went against the norm when he was unable to find evidence of self-schematicity in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Another finding was that when referencing gender and religion, there was a low memory recall when compared with referencing the self. A [[meta-analysis]] by Symons and Johnson (1997) showed self-reference resulting in better memory in comparison to tasks relying on [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding or other-referent encoding. According to Symons and Johnson, self-referencing questions elicit elaboration and organization in memory, both of which creating a deeper encoding and thus facilitate memory.&lt;ref name="source4" /&gt;

Theorists that favor the view that the self has a special role believe that the self leads to more in depth processing, leading to easier recall during self-reference tasks.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Theorists also promote the self-schema as being one of the sole inhibitors that allow for recall from deep memory.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; Thorndyke and Hayes-Roth had the goal of focusing on the process made by the active memory schemata.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndyke, P. W., &amp; Hayes-Roth, B. (1979). The use schemata in the acquisition and transfer of knowledge.'' Cognitive Psychology, 11''(1), 82-106. [[doi: 10.1016/0010-0285(79)90005-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-typed individuals recall trait adjectives that go along with their sex role more quickly than trait adjectives that are not. During the process of free recall, these individuals also showed more patterns for gender clustering than other sexually typed individuals.&lt;ref name="source16" /&gt;

==Types of self-referential encoding tasks==
As research on self-referential encoding became more prolific, some psychologists took an opportunity to delineate specific self-referential encoding tasks. It is noted that descriptive tasks are those that require participants to determine if a stimulus word can be classified as "self-descriptive." Autobiographical tasks are those that require participants to use the stimulus word as a cue to recall an autobiographical memory. Results from experiments that differentiated between these types of self-referential encoding found that they both produced better recall than semantic tasks, and neither was more advantageous than the other. However, research does suggest that the two types of self-referential encoding do rely on different processes to facilitate memory.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; In most experiments discussed, these types of self- referential encoding were not differentiated.

In a typical self-reference task, adjectives are presented and classified as either self-descriptive or not.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; For example, in a study by Dobson and Shaw, adjectives about the self that were preselected were given to the participants and they decide whether or not the adjectives are self-descriptive.&lt;ref name="source12" /&gt;  The basis for making certain judgments, decisions, inferences and decisions is a self-referent encoding task. If two items are classified as self-descriptive there is no reason one trait would not be equally as easy to retrieve as the other on a self-reference task.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt;

==Explanations for the self-reference effect==
While a significant amount of research supports the existence of the self-reference effect, the processes behind it are not well understood. However, multiple hypotheses have been introduced, and two main arguments have been developed: the elaborative processing hypothesis and the organizational processing hypothesis.&lt;ref name="source3"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Loftus, J. (1988). The nature of self-referent encoding: The contributions of elaborative and organizational processes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55''(1), 5-11. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.55.1.5&lt;/ref&gt; Encodings in reference to the self are so elaborate because of the information one has about the self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Information encoded with the self is better remembered than information encoded with reference to something else.&lt;ref name="source34"&gt;Bennett, M., Allan, S., Anderson, J., &amp; Asker, N. (2010). On the robustness of the group reference effect. European Journal of Social Psychology, 40(2), 349-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elaboration===
Elaboration refers to the encoding of a single word by forming connections between it and other material already stored in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; By creating these connections between the stimulus word and other material already in memory, multiple routes for retrieval of the stimulus word are formed.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Based on the depth of processing framework, memory retention increases as elaboration during encoding increases.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; The Elaborative Processing Hypothesis would suggest that any encoding task that leads to the development of the most trace elaboration or associations is the best for memory retention. Additional research on the depth of processing hierarchy suggests that self-reference is the superior method of information encoding. The elaborative hypothesis would suggest this is because self-reference creates the most elaborate trace,&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; due to the many links that can be made between the stimulus and information about the self already in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Organization===
The organizational processing hypothesis was proposed by Klein and Kihlstrom.&lt;ref name="source2" /&gt; This hypothesis suggests that encoding is best prompted by considering stimulus words in relation to one another. This thought process and relational thinking creates word to word associations.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; These inter-item associations are paths in memory that can be used during retrieval. Also, the category labels that define the relations between stimulus items can be used as item cues. Evidence of the organizational component of encoding is demonstrated through the clustering of words during recall.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Word clustering during recall indicates that relational information was used to store the words in memory. Rogers, Kuiper and Kirker showed that self-referential judgments were more likely to encourage organization than semantic ones.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Therefore, they suggested the self-reference effect was likely due to the organizational processing endured by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Structural, phonemic and semantic tasks within the depth of processing paradigm require words to be considered individually, and lend themselves to an elaborative approach. As such, it can be argued that self-referential encoding is superior because it leads to an indirect division of words into categories: words that describe me versus words that do not.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Due to this connection between self-reference and organizational processing, further research has been done on this area. Klein and Kihlstrom's research suggests first that, like previous research, self-reference led to better recall than semantic and structural encoding. Second, they found that self-referentially encoded words were more clustered in recall than words from other tasks, suggesting higher levels of organizational processing. From this they concluded that the organization, not encoding task, is what makes self-referential encoding superior &lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Dual process===
Psychologists Einstein and Hunt showed that both elaborative processing and organizational processing facilitate recall. However, their research argues that the effectiveness of either approach depends on how related the stimulus words are to one another. A list of highly related stimulus words would be better encoded using the elaborative method. The relations between the words would be evident to subjects; therefore, they would not gain any additional pathways for retrieval by encoding the words based on their categorical membership. Instead, the other information gained through elaborative processing would be more beneficial. On the other hand, a list of stimulus words with little relation would be better stored to memory through the organizational method. Since the words have no obvious connection to one another, subjects would likely encode them individually, using an elaborative approach. Since relational information wouldn't be readily detected, focusing on it would add to memory by creating new traces for retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, G. O., &amp; Hunt, R. R. (1980). Levels of processing and organization: Additive effects of individual item and relational processing. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory'',''6'', 588-598.&lt;/ref&gt; Superior recall was better explained by a combination of elaboration and organization.
 
Ultimately, the exact processes behind self-referential encoding that makes it superior to other encoding tasks are still under debate. Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis. This research, then, suggests that the self-reference effect cannot be explained by a single type of processing.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Instead, self-referential encoding must lead to information in memory that incorporates item specific and relational information.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Overall, the SRE relies on the unique mnemonic aspects of the self. Ultimately, if the research is suggesting that the self has superior elaborative or organizational properties, information related to the self should be more easily remembered and recalled.&lt;ref name="source4"&gt;Symons, C. S., &amp; Johnson, B. T. (1997). The self-reference effect in memory: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 121''(3), 371-394. doi:10.1037/0033-2909.121.3.371&lt;/ref&gt; The research presented suggests that self-referential encoding is superior because it promotes organization and elaboration simultaneously, and provides self-relevant categories that promote recall.&lt;ref name = "source4"/&gt;

==Social brain science==
The field of social brain science is aimed at examining the neural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; Neuroimaging and neuropsychology have led to the examination of neuroanatomy and its connection to psychological topics.&lt;ref name="source7"&gt;Mitchell, J. P., Banaji, M. R., &amp; Macrae, C. (2005). The Link between social cognition and self-referential thought in the medial prefrontal cortex. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17''(8), 1306-1315. doi:10.1162/0898929055002418&lt;/ref&gt; Through this research, neuropsychologists have found a connection between social cognitive functioning and the medial [[prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC). In addition, the mPFC has been connected to reflection and introspection about personal mental states.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; Supporting these findings, it has been shown that damage to the mPFC is connected to impairments with self-reflection, introspection and daydreaming, as well as social competence, but not other areas of functioning.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; As such, the mPFC has been connected to self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt;

The research discussed by those focusing on the neuroanatomy of self-referential processing included similar tasks to the memory and depth of processing research discussed previously. When participants were asked to judge adjectives based in whether or not they were self-descriptive, it was noted that the more self-relevant the trait, the stronger the activation of the mPFC. In addition, it was shown that the mPFC was activated during the appraisal of one's own personality traits, as well as during trait retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; One study showed that the more activity in the mPFC during self-referential judgments, the more likely the word was to be remembered on a subsequent surprise memory test. These results suggest that the mPFC is involved in both self-referential processing and in creating self-relevant memories.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation occurs during processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source33"&gt;Moran, J. M., Macrae, C. N., Heatherton, T. F., Wyland, C. L., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2006). Neuroanatomical evidence for distinct cognitive and affective components of self. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18''(9), 1586-1594. doi:10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1586&lt;/ref&gt; When self-referent judgment is more relatable and less negative, the mFPC is activated. Finding support clear cut circuits that have high levels of activation when cognitive and emotional aspects of self-reflection are present.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The [[caudate nucleus]] has not been associated with self-reference before, however, Fossati and colleagues found activity while participants were retrieving self-relevant trait adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, P., Hevenor, S. J., Lepage, M., Graham, S. J., Grady, C., Keightley, M. L., et al. (2004). Distributed self in episodic memory: Neural correlates of successful retrieval of self-encoded positive and negative personality traits. ''Neuroimage, 22''(4), 1596-1604. [[doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034|doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The ventral [[Cingulate cortex#Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate cortex]] (vACC) is also a part of the brain that becomes activated when there are signs of self-referencing and processing. The vACC is activated when self-descriptive information is negative.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; There is also pCC ([[posterior cingulate cortex]]) activity seen in neuroimaging studies during self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt;

===Depth of processing or cognitive structure===
Given all of the neurological support for the effect of self-reference on encoding and memory, there is still a debate in the psychological community about whether or not the self-reference effect signifies a special functional role played by the self in cognition. Generally, this question is met by people that have two opposing views on the processes behind self-reference. On one side of the debate, people believe that the self has special mnemonic abilities because it is a unique cognitive structure. On the other side, people support the arguments described above that suggest there is no special structure, but instead, the self-reference effect is simply a part of the standard depth of processing hierarchy. Since the overall hypothesis is the same for both sides of the debate, that self-relevant material leads to enhanced memory, it is difficult to test them using strictly behavioral measures. Therefore, PET and fMRI scans have been used to see the neural marker of self-referential mental activity.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Previous studies have shown that areas of the left prefrontal cortex are activated during semantic encoding. Therefore, if the self-reference effect works the same way, as part of the depth of processing hierarchy, the same brain region should be activated when judging traits related to the self. However, if the self has unique mnemonic properties, then self-referential tasks should activate brain regions distinct from those activated during semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; The field is still at is infancy, but future work on this hypothesis might help to settle the debate about the underlying processes of self-referential encoding.

===Simulation theory===
While not able to completely settle the debate over the foundation of self-referential processing, studies on the neurological aspect of personality trait judgments did lead to a related, significant result. It has been shown that judging personality traits about oneself and a close friend activated overlapping brain regions, and the activated regions have all been implicated in self-reference. Noting the similarity between making self-judgments and judgments about close others led to the introduction of the [[simulation theory of empathy]]. Simulation theory rests on the idea that one can make inferences about others by using the knowledge they have about themselves.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; In essence, the theory suggests that people use self-reflection to understand or predict the mental state of others.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; The more similar a person perceives another to be, the more active the mPFC has shown to be, suggesting more deep or intricate self-reference.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; However, this effect can cause people to make inaccurate judgments about others or to believe that their own opinions are representative of others in general. This misrepresentation is referred to as the [[false-consensus effect]].&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt;

==Expansion of the SRE: group reference==
In addition to simulation theory, other expansions of the self-reference effect have been examined. Through studying the self, researchers have found that the self consists of many independent cognitive representations. For example, the personal self composed of individual characteristics is separate from the relational self which is based on relationships with significant others. These two forms of self are again separate from the collective self which corresponds to a particular group identity.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer M. B. ,&amp; Gardner, W. (1996). Who is this 'We'? Levels of collective identity and self representations. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71'', 83–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the existence of the collective self and the different group identities that combine to form such a self-representation led researchers to question if information stored in reference to a social group identity has the same effects in memory as information stored in reference to the individual self. In essence, researchers questioned if the self-reference effect can be extended to include situations where the self is more socially defined, producing a group-reference effect.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Previous research supports the idea that the group-reference effect should exist from a theoretical standpoint. First, the self-expansion model argues that individuals incorporate characteristics of their significant others (or other in-group members &lt;ref&gt;Wright, S.C., Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe, T., &amp; Ropp, S. A. (1997). The extended contact effect: Knowledge of cross-group friendships and prejudice. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73'', 73–90.&lt;/ref&gt; into the development of their self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., Aron, E., Tudor, M., &amp; Nelson, G. (1991). Close relationships as including other and self. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60'', 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt; From this model, it is reasonable to conclude that characteristics that are common to both oneself and their significant others (or in-group members) would be more accessible.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Second, the previous research discussed suggests that the self-reference effect is due to some combination of organizational, elaborative, mental cueing or evaluative properties of self-referential encoding tasks. Given that we have significant stores of knowledge about our social identities, and such collective identities provide an organizational framework, it is reasonable to assume that a group-reference task would operate similar to that of a self-reference task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

In order to test these claims, Johnson and colleagues aimed to test whether the self-reference effect generalized to group level identities. Their first study was structured to simply assess if group-reference influenced subsequent memory. In their experiment, they used membership at a particular university as the group of reference. They included group-reference, self-reference and semantic tasks. The experiment replicated the self-reference effect, consistent with previous research. In addition, evidence for a group-reference effect was found.  Group-referenced encoding produced better recall than the semantic tasks, and the level of recall from the group-referenced task was not significantly different from the self-referenced task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Despite finding evidence of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, in order to reach conclusive evidence of a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference.  Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;
 
Both experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, T. J., Rule, G. R., &amp; Carlson, D. (1983). Memory for personally relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44'', 251–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.&lt;ref&gt;Gaertner, L., Sedikides, C., &amp; Graetz, K. (1999). In search of self-definition: Motivational primacy of the individual self, motivational primacy of the collective self, or contextual primacy? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76'', 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;

Ultimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect. Similar to the memorable nature of references to a person's individual self, references to social identities are seemed to be privileged in memory as well.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

==Applications==
Once the foundation of research on self-referential encoding was established, psychologists began to explore how the concept applied to different groups of people, and connected to different phenomena.

===Autism spectrum disorder===
Individuals diagnosed with [[autism spectrum]] disorders (ASDs) can display a wide range of symptoms.  Some of the most common characteristics of individuals with ASDs include impairments with social functioning, language and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In addition, it is often noted that these individuals are more "self-focused." That is, they have difficulty seeing things from another's perspective.&lt;ref name="source10"&gt;Lombardo, M. V., Barnes, J. L., Wheelwright, S. J., Cohen-Baron, S. (2007). Self-referential cognition and empathy in autism. ''PLoS ONE, 2''(9), e883. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000883&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being self-focused, though, research has shown that individuals with ASD's often have difficulty identifying or describing their emotions or the emotions of others. When asked to describe their daily experiences, responses from individuals on the autism spectrum tended to focus more on physical descriptions rather than mental and emotional states. In regards to their social interactions and behavior differences, it is thought that these individuals lack top down control, and therefore, their bottom up decisions remain unchecked. This simply suggests that these individuals cannot use their prior knowledge and memory to make sense of new input, but instead react to each new input individually, compiling them to make a whole picture &lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Noting the difficulty individuals with ASDs experience with [[self-awareness]], it was thought that they might have difficulty with self-related memory processes.&lt;ref name="source9"&gt;Henderson, H. A., Zahka, N. E., Kojkowski, N. M., Inge, A. P., Schwartz, C. B., Hileman, C. M., &amp; ... Mundy, P. C. (2009). Self-referenced memory, social cognition, and symptom presentation in autism. ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50''(7), 853-861. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02059.x&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists questioned if these individuals would show the typical self-reference effect in memory.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; In one Depth of Processing Study, participants were asked questions about the descriptiveness of certain stimulus words. However, unlike previous DOP studies that focused on phonemic, structural, semantic and self-referential tasks, the tasks were altered for this experiment. To test the referential abilities of individuals with ASD's, the encoding tasks were divided into: "the self," asking to what extent a stimulus word described oneself, "similar close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of one's best friend, "dissimilar non-close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of Harry Potter, and a control group that was asked to determine the number of syllables in each word. Following these encoding tasks, participants were given thirty minutes before a surprise memory task. It was found that individuals with ASD's had no impairment in memory for words encoded in the syllable or dissimilar non-close other condition. However, they had decreased memory for words related to the self.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Therefore, while research suggests that self-referentially encoded information is encoded more deeply than other information, the research on individuals with ASD's showed no advantage for memory recognition with self-reference tasks over semantic encoding tasks. This suggests that individuals with ASD's don't preferentially encode self-relevant information. Psychologists have investigated the biological basis for the decreased self-reference effect among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and have suggested that it may be due to less specialized neural activity in the mPFC for those individuals.&lt;ref name = "source9"/&gt; However, while individuals with ASD's showed smaller self-reference effects than the control group, some evidence of a self-reference effect was evident in some cases. This indicates that self-referent impairments are a matter of degree, not total absence.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Lombardo and his colleagues measured empathy among individuals with ASD's, and showed that these individuals scored lower than the control group on all empathy measures.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; This may be a result of the difficulty for these individuals to understand or take the perspective of others, in conjunction with their difficulty identifying emotions. This has implications for simulation theory, because these individuals are unable to use their self-knowledge to make conclusions about similar others.

Ultimately, the research suggests that people with ASD's might benefit from being more self-focused. The better their ability to reflect on themselves, the better the can [[mentalization|mentalize]] with others.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

===Depression===
There are three possible relations between cognitive processes and  [[anxiety]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. The first is whether cognitive processes are actually caused by the onset of clinically diagnosed symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] or just generalized sadness or anxiousness. The second is whether emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety are able to be considered as caused by cognitions. And the third is whether different specific cognitive processes are able to be considered associates of different disorders.&lt;ref name="source11"&gt;Strauman, T. J. (1989). Self-discrepancies in clinical depression and social phobia: Cognitive structures that underlie emotional disorders?. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 98''(1), 14-22. doi:10.1037/0021-843X.98.1.14&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs and Beck (1977) posited a schematic model of depression where an already depressed self was primed by outside prompts that negatively impacted cognitive illusions of the world in the eye of oneself. These prompts only led participants to a more depressive series of emotions and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, M., &amp; Beck, A. T. (1977). Cognitive-affective processes in depression. In C. E. Izard (Ed.), ''Emotions and psychopathology'' (pp.79-107). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The results from the study done by Derry and Kuiper supported Beck's theory that a negative self-schema is present in people, especially those with depressive disorder.&lt;ref name="source13" /&gt; Depressed individuals attribute depressive adjectives to themselves more than nondepressive adjectives.&lt;ref name="source12"&gt;Dobson, K. S., &amp; Shaw, B. F. (1987). Specificity and stability of self-referent encoding in clinical depression. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 96''(1), 34-40. doi:10.1037/0021-843X.96.1.34&lt;/ref&gt; Those suffering from a more mild case of depression have trouble deciphering between the traits of themselves and others which results in a loss of their self-esteem and their negative self-evaluation. A depressive schema is what causes the negativity reported by those suffering from depression.&lt;ref name="source13"&gt;Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Derry, P. A. (1982). Depressed and nondepressed content self-reference in mild depressives. ''Journal of Personality, 50''(1), 67-80. doi:10.1111/j.1467-6494.1982.tb00746.x&lt;/ref&gt; Kuiper and Derry found that self-referent recall enhancement was limited only to nondepressed content.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt;

Generally, self-focus is association with negative emotions. In particular private self-focus is more strongly associated with depression than public self-focus.&lt;ref&gt;Mor, N., &amp; Winquist, J. Self-focused attention and negative affect: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 128''(4), 636-662. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.128.4.638&lt;/ref&gt;  Results from brain-imaging studies shows
that during self-referential processing, those with major depressive disorder show greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that depressed individuals may be exhibiting greater cognitive control than
non-depressed individuals when processing self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source35"&gt;Lemogne, C., le Bastard, G., Mayberg, H., Volle, E., Bergouignan, L., Lehericy, S., et al. (2009). In search of the depressive self: extended medial prefrontal network during self-referential processing in major depression. ''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 4'', 305-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No Thumbtacks.jpg|thumb|300px]]'''Self-referential humor''', also known as '''self-reflexive humor''' or '''meta humor''', is a type of [[Expression (language)|comedic expression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.vo.lu/homepages/phahn/humor/self_ref.htm |title=Sentences about Self-Reference and Recurrence |publisher=.vo.lu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that—either directed toward some other subject, or openly directed toward itself—intentionally [[allude]]s to the very person who is expressing the [[humor]] in a comedic fashion, or to some specific aspect of that same comedic expression.  Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and [[surreal humor|surrealistically]] is a form of [[bathos]]. In general, self-referential humor often uses [[hypocrisy]], [[oxymoron]], or [[paradox]] to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Self referential humor]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Self-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the [[fourth wall]] to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of.

[[Old Comedy]] of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. [[Aristophanes]], whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hughes; ''Performing Greek Comedy'' (Cambridge, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RAS syndrome]] refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an [[acronym]] or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words. However, "RAS" stands for '''R'''edundant '''A'''cronym '''S'''yndrome; therefore, the full phrase yields "Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome" and is self-referencing in a comical manner.  It also reflects an excessive use of [[Three-letter acronym|TLA]]s ('''T'''hree '''L'''etter '''A'''cronyms).

[[Meta]] has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential. Popularised by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] who wrote several books on himself and the subject of self-reference, [[meta-joke]]s are a popular form of humor.

--&gt; Physical objects can be primary sources.

===Secondary and tertiary===
{{main|Secondary source|Tertiary source}}
[[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. These are not as authoritative and are supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These documents or people summarize other material, usually primary source material. They are academics, journalists, and other researchers, and the papers and books they produce. This includes published accounts, published works, or published research. For example a history book drawing upon diary and newspaper records. 

[[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources.&lt;ref name=umdguide /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html Glossary, Using Information Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html |date=2008-08-28 }}. ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources".) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_" /&gt; These are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels. They consist of generalized research of a specific subject under consideration. Tertiary sources are analyzed, assimilated, evaluated, interpreted, and/or synthesized from secondary sources, also. These are not authoritative and are just supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These are often meant to present known information in a convenient form with no claim to originality. Common examples are [[encyclopedia]]s and [[textbook]]s.

The distinction between  ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' is standard in [[historiography]], while the distinction between these sources and ''tertiary sources'' is more peripheral, and is more relevant to the scholarly research work than to the published content itself.

==Types==
Below are types of sources that most generally, but not absolutely, fall into a certain level. The letters after an item describes ''generally'' the type it is (though this can vary pending the exact source). ''P'' is for Primary sources, ''S'' is for Secondary sources, and ''T'' is for Tertiary sources. (ed., those with ''?''s are indeterminate.)

==In translation==
In translation, a source text (ST) is a text written in a given [[Source language (translation)|source language]] which is to be, or has been, translated into another language. In translation the source text (ST) is transformed into a [[target text]] (TT), written in a given [[Target language (translation)|target language]]. According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, "the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Translation scholars including [[Eugene Nida]] and [[Peter Newmark]] have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=67-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Crime Book (Big Ideas Simply Explained)''''' is a non-fiction volume co-authored by American crime writers [[Cathy Scott]], [[Shanna Hogan]], [[Rebecca Morris (author)|Rebecca Morris]], Canadian author and [[historian]] [[Lee Mellor]], and United Kingdom author Michael Kerrigan, with a foreword for the U.S. edition by Scott and the U.K. edition by crime-fiction author [[Peter James (writer)|Peter James]]. It was released by [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Books]] under its [[Big Ideas Learning]] imprint in May 2017.

==Synopsis==
The publisher describes ''The Crime Book'' as a guide to criminology that explores the most infamous cases of all time, from serial killers to mob hits to war crimes and more.

It includes a variety of crimes committed by more than 100 of the world's most notorious criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimetime.co.uk/mag/index.php/showarticle/4787|title=crimetime.co.uk - The Crime Book To Be Published By Dorling Kindersley|author=|date=|publisher=Crime Time News}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Jack the Ripper]] to [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], the book is a study of international true-crime history that covers shocking stories through infographics and research that lays out key facts and details. It examines the science, psychology and sociology of criminal behavior. It profiles of villains, victims and detectives. Each clue is listed for readers to follow investigations from start to finish, and studies the police and detective work for each case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wgnradio.com/2017/05/02/cathy-scott-the-crime-book/|title=Cathy Scott: ‘The Crime Book’|author=|date=2 May 2017|website=wgnradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Q&amp;A article for CrimeCon's blog with Scott, the author described the crimes detailed in the book as having "such diversity that there is something for everyone. ...  I can’t think of one crime that’s not represented in The Crime Book. It runs the gamut—from nonviolent cons to gangland-style criminals, to white-collar offenders—with a complete representation starting with the first known homicide committed against a Neanderthal man. Simply put, you can’t make this stuff up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimecon.com/blog/2017/4/9/the-crime-book-qa-with-author-cathy-scott|title=The Crime Book Q&amp;A with Author Cathy Scott|author=|date=9 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's description, in an August 2017 interview with co-author Scott about the book, wrote that it is "an encyclopedic treatment of the topic (that) makes for excellent companion reading. A compelling compilation of human trickery and awfulness, it covers crimes from arson, art forgery and kidnapping to bank robbery, drug trafficking and, of course, murder, with many of the entries accompanied by helpful illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/crime-book-what-we-learned-from-giant-history-of-true-crime-w496295|title='The Crime Book': What We Learned from Giant History of True Crime|author=Phoebe Neidl
|date=August 22, 2017|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Reader's Digest]]'' listed it as one of its "Best New Books You Should Read This April," describing it as "everything you ever wanted to know about some of the most audacious, hideous, hilarious and mysterious acts of crime in one explosive book, filled with graphs, illustrations, quotes and timelines. This highly addictive encyclopedia of crime ... is a trivia goldmine and a helpful guide allowing you to put events into context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readersdigest.co.uk/books/book-lists/best-new-books-you-should-read-april|title=Best new books you should read this April|author=|date=|publisher=Reader's Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Culture Magazine]]'' in Germany had this to say: "The level of expertise is quite high," noting that the book "is lushly illustrated, readable and entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturmag.de/rubriken/buecher/bloody-chops-april-2017/100665|title=Bloody Chops - April 2017 - CulturMag|author=|date=15 April 2017|publisher=Culture Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review, ''Crime Fiction Lover'' wrote that "a crack team of true-crime experts helped put it together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimefictionlover.com/2017/03/first-look-the-crime-book-from-dorling-kindersley/|title=First look: The Crime Book from Dorling Kindersley » CRIME FICTION LOVER|author=|date=March 2017|website=www.crimefictionlover.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Crimespree Magazine'' wrote, "The crimes covered are all over from serial killers to gangsters and outlaws to kidnappers and elderly Brit bank robbers. This is a great book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimespreemag.com/trio-non-fiction-crime-books/|title=A Trio Of Great Non-Fiction Crime Books|author=|date=12 April 2017|publisher=Crimespree Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11159">A '''three-letter acronym''' ('''TLA'''), or '''three-letter abbreviation''', is an [[abbreviation]], specifically an [[Acronym|acronym, alphabetism, or initialism]], consisting of three letters. These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as ''etc.'' and ''Mrs.'' are not three-letter acronyms, but "TLA" {{em|itself}} is a TLA (an example of an [[Autological word|autological]] abbreviation).

Most three-letter abbreviations are ''initialisms'': all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in ''[[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|p|iː|ˈ|eɪ}} {{respell|AY|pee|AY|'}}. Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; [[computed axial tomography]], CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in "CAT scan".

==History and origins==

The exact phrase ''three-letter acronym'' appeared in the sociology literature in 1975.&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. J. |last=Levy |title=Review of ''The Logic of Social Systems'' |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |year=1975 |jstor=2777655 |doi=10.1086/226119 |page=658 |quote=The acronyms DSE and DNA have something in common: each is a three-letter acronym.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-letter acronyms were used as [[mnemonic]]s in biological sciences, from 1977&lt;ref name=Seavey&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. R. |last=Seavey |first2=P. H. |last2=Raven |year=1977 |title=Chromosomal Differentiation and the Sources of the South American Species of ''Epilobium'' (Onagraceae) |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=57 | doi = 10.2307/3038128 |jstor=3038128 |quote=All taxa indicated by three-letter acronyms with strains indicated by a fourth letter if necessary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. A. |last=Weber |year=1982 |title=Mnemonic Three-Letter Acronyms for the Families of Vascular Plants: A Device for More Effective Herbarium Curation |journal=Taxon |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=74–88 |jstor=1220592 |doi=10.2307/1220592}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. D. |last=Nilsen |first2=A. P. |last2=Nilsen |year=1995 |title=Literary Metaphors and Other Linguistic Innovations in Computer Language |journal=The English Journal |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=65–71 |jstor=820897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair [[ZX81]] home computer used and explained TLA.&lt;ref name=ZX81&gt;[[Steve Vickers (academia)|Steven Vickers]] ''ZX81 Basic Programming'', Sinclair Research Limited, page 161 "As you can see, everything has a three letter abbreviation (TLA)."&lt;/ref&gt; The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a [[JPL]] report of 1982.&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;[http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-70/70R.PDF TDA Progress Report] R. Hull (1982) An Introduction to the new Productivity Information Management System page 176&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, in a paper titled "On the cruelty of really teaching computer science", eminent computer scientist [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] wrote &lt;!-- disparagingly (see quote in context) --&gt;
"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA  ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html On the cruelty of really teaching computer science]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992 it was in a [[Microsoft]] handbook.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Gookin (1992) ''The Microsoft Guide to Optimizing Windows'' page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinatorics==

The number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or [[permutations]]) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336.

In [[English language|English]], [[WWW (disambiguation)|WWW]] is the longest possible TLA to [[Pronunciation of "www"|pronounce]], typically requiring nine [[syllable]]s. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the [[acronym]] instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, "www" is sometimes abbreviated as "dubdubdub" in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.brynmawr.edu/features/digispeak-a-glossary-of-the-new-lingo/|title=DigiSpeak: A Glossary of the New Lingo|date=May 2011|website=bryn mawr alumnae bulletin|publisher=Bryn Mawr College Alumnae Association|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* As early as 1967, the musical [[Hair (musical)|Hair]] included the song "Initials", whose final verse consisted only of TLAs, viz: "LBJ IRT USA LSD. LSD LBJ FBI CIA. FBI CIA LSD LBJ."
* In 1986, Will Shatter of the band [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] formed a band named "Any Three Initials" (A3I), as a parody of the preponderance of hardcore punk bands with three-initial names.
* In 1998, the [[UK|British]] band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] released their last album, [[Lift (Love and Rockets album)|Lift]], featuring the song "R.I.P. 20 C." that, apart from the refrain, consists only of three-letter abbreviations. A contest was held rewarding the first person to correctly give the meanings of all 69 of them.
* In 1999, German hip-hop group [[Die Fantastischen Vier]] (The Fantastic Four) released the song "MfG" ("Mit freundlichen Grüßen", [[german language|German]] for "Best regards", literally "With friendly greetings"), also mainly consisting of TLAs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Die-fantastischen-vier-mit-freundlichen-gruen-mfg-lyrics Lyrics of "MfG"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2001, Portland Oregon songwriter [[Craig Carothers]] produced a song entitled "BFD" which includes many three-letter acronyms throughout the [[lyrics]]. It has been recorded by Carothers as well as [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Berkley Hart]] and [[Don Henry]].
* According to the [[Jargon File]], a journalist once asked hacker [[Paul Boutin (journalist)|Paul Boutin]] what he thought the biggest problem in computing in the 1990s would be. Paul's straight-faced response was: "There are only 17,000 three-letter acronyms."
* The [[Jargon File]] also mentions the abbreviation "ETLA" for "extended three-letter acronym" to refer to four-letter acronyms/abbreviations. "Extended three-letter acronym" is sometimes abbreviated to "XTLA".

In [[set theory]], a '''universal set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] which contains all objects, including itself.&lt;ref&gt;Forster 1995 p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[set theory]] as usually formulated, the conception of a universal set leads to a [[paradox]] ([[Russell's paradox]]) and is consequently not allowed. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.

== Notation ==
There is no standard notation for the universal set of a given set theory. Common symbols include '''V''', '''U''' and '''[[xi (letter)|ξ]]'''.

==Reasons for nonexistence==
[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the [[cumulative hierarchy]], do not allow for the existence of a universal set. It is directly contradicted by the [[axiom of regularity]], and its existence would cause paradoxes which would make the theory inconsistent.

===Russell's paradox===
{{Main|Russell's paradox}}
Russell's paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and other set theories that include [[Zermelo]]'s [[axiom of comprehension]].
This axiom states that, for any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and any set {{mvar|A}}, there exists another set 
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in A \mid \varphi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
that contains exactly those elements {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|A}} that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.  If a universal set&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} existed and the axiom of comprehension could be applied to it, then
there would also exist another set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in V\mid x\not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. However, as [[Bertrand Russell]] observed, this set is paradoxical. If it contains itself, then it should not contain itself, and vice versa. For this reason, it cannot exist.

===Cantor's theorem===
{{Main|Cantor's theorem}}
A second difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the [[power set]] of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist.  However, this conflicts with Cantor's theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself.

==Theories of universality==
The difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.

===Restricted comprehension===
There are set theories known to be [[consistent]] (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set {{mvar|V}} does exist (and &lt;math&gt;V \in V&lt;/math&gt; is true). In these theories, Zermelo's [[axiom of comprehension]] does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of [[naive set theory]] is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a [[non-well-founded set theory]].
The most widely studied set theory with a universal set is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s [[New Foundations]]. [[Alonzo Church]] and [[:de:Arnold Oberschelp|Arnold Oberschelp]] also published work on such set theories.  Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine's,&lt;ref&gt;Church 1974 p. 308. See also Forster 1995 p. 136 or 2001 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flash Sheridan |date=2016 |title=A Variant of Church’s Set Theory with a Universal Set in which the Singleton Function is a Set |url=http://www.logic-center.be/Publications/Bibliotheque/SheridanVariantChurch.pdf |journal=Logique et Analyse |volume=59 |issue=233 |at=§0.2 |doi=10.2143/LEA.233.0.3149532|lay-url=http://www-logic.stanford.edu/seminar/1314/Sheridan_Fixing_Freges_Set_Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not possible for Oberschelp's, since in it the singleton function is provably a set,&lt;ref&gt;Oberschelp 1973 p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; which leads immediately to paradox in New Foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1998 p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent advances in this area have been made by [[Randall Holmes]] who published an online draft version of the book ''[[Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/ |title=Overview of Randall Holmes's Home Page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is [[positive set theory]], where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the [[positive formula]]s (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.

===Universal objects that are not sets===
{{main|Universe (mathematics)}}
The idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see [[universal quantifier]]).  One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe {{mvar|V}} and similar large collections as [[Class (set theory)|proper classes]] rather than as sets. One difference between a universal set and a [[universal class (set theory)|universal class]] is that the universal class does not contain itself, because [[proper class]]es cannot be elements of other classes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Russell's paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.

The [[category of sets]] can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. 
Again, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">'''William Chaffers''' (28 September 1811 – 12 April 1892) was an English antiquary and writer of reference works on [[hallmark]]s, and marks on [[ceramics]]. His ''Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain'', first published in 1863, has appeared in many later editions.

==Life==
Chaffers was the son of William Chaffers and wife Sarah, and was born in Watling Street, London, in 1811; he was descended from a brother of [[Richard Chaffers]] (1731–1765), a manufacturer of [[Liverpool porcelain]]. He was educated at Margate and at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]], where he was entered in 1824.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|first=Thomas|last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|wstitle=Chaffers, William|volume=1|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5016|title=Chaffers, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was attracted to antiquarian studies while a clerk in the city of London, by the discovery of Roman and medieval antiquities in the foundations of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] during 1838–9. At the same time he began to concentrate attention upon the study of gold and silver plate and ceramics, especially in regard to the official and other marks by which dates and places of fabrication can be distinguished. In 1863 Chaffers published two important works:&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
* ''Hall Marks on Gold and Silver Plate, illustrated, with Tables of Annual Date Letters employed in the Assay Offices of the United Kingdom''; in the 8th edition of 1896 it included "Histories of the Goldsmiths' Trade, both in England and France, and revised London and Provincial Tables", and an introductory essay by C. A. Markham.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
* ''Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain of the Renaissance and Modern Periods, with Historical Notices of each Manufactory, preceded by an introductory Essay on Vasa Fictilia of the Greek, Romano-British, and Mediæval Eras''. The aim of the work was to be for ceramics what {{ill|Franz Brulliot|de}}'s ''Dictionnaire des Monogrammes'' was to painting, and it at once established Chaffers as the leading authority upon his subject.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt; Many subsequent editions have appeared, revised by later editors; the 9th edition appeared in 1900, and the 15th edition in 1965.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Other publications are ''The Keramic Gallery'', in 2 volumes, with 500 illustrations (1872); a handbook abridged from ''Marks and Monograms'' (1874); ''Gilda Aurifabrorum'', a history of goldsmiths and plate workers and their marks (1883); also a priced catalogue of coins, and other minor catalogues.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

His reputation was furthered in organizing exhibitions of art treasures, at [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|Manchester in 1857]], [[1862 International Exhibition|South Kensington in 1862]], Leeds in 1869, Dublin in 1872, Wrexham in 1876, and Hanley (at the great Staffordshire exhibition of ceramics) in 1890. Chaffers was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1843, and he was a frequent contributor to ''Archæologia'', to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', and to various learned periodicals upon the two subjects of which he had particular knowledge.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;

In 1841 he married Charlotte Matilda, daughter of John Hewett.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; About 1870 he retired from [[Fitzroy Square]] to a house in Willesden Lane, and later moved to [[West Hampstead]], where he died on 12 April 1892.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
