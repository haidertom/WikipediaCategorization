Angelfish Software is an on-premises, self-hosted web analytics application which allows organizations to monitor how users interact with websites and web-based applications. Angelfish can use web server logs or JavaScript page tags to create reports.

==History==
First released in 2013, Angelfish Software was created in response to Google's cancellation of [[Urchin (software)|Urchin]] and the lack of options that existed for on-premises web analytics software.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/google-retires-web-analytics-software-tool-urchin Google Retires Web Analytics Software Tool Urchin] Web Host Industry Review, 2013-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketingland.com/urchin-is-closing-4068 Urchin is Closing] Marketing Land, 2012-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelfish is a popular solution for tracking Intranet &lt;ref&gt;[http://webstrategyforeveryone.com/tools-intranet-analytics/ Tools for Intranet Analytics] Web Strategy For Everyone, 2015-09-15&lt;/ref&gt; and SharePoint&lt;ref&gt;[https://sharepointdragons.com/2015/06/17/3rd-party-analytics-for-sharepoint-2013/ 3rd Party Analytics for SharePoint 2013] SharePoint Dragons, 2015-06-17&lt;/ref&gt; environments, and has significant interest from organizations that are required to protect website visitor data due to regulations, or cannot use Google Analytics due to data privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sebastiangreger.net/2014/02/privacy-aware-design-replacing-google-analytics/ Privacy-Aware Design: Replacing Google Analytics] Sebastien Granger, 2014-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6181">An '''applicant tracking system''' ('''ATS''') is a [[application software|software application]] that enables the electronic handling of recruitment needs. An ATS can be implemented or accessed online on an enterprise or small business level, depending on the needs of the company and there is also [[Free and open-source ATS#Free and open-source applicant tracking system software|free and open source ATS]] software available. An ATS is very similar to [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THIS APPLICANT TRACKING SYSTEM IS YOUR CRM|url=https://power.pereless.com/applicant-tracking-system-crm/|publisher=Pereless Systems|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are designed for recruitment tracking purposes. In many cases they filter applications automatically based on given criteria such as keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience and schools attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204624204577178941034941330|title=Your Résumé vs. Oblivion|first=Lauren|last=Weber|date=24 January 2012|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused many to adapt [[Resume parsing|resume optimization]] techniques similar to those used in [[search engine optimization]] when creating and formatting their résumé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Résumé vs. Oblivion|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204624204577178941034941330|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
A dedicated ATS is not uncommon for recruitment specific needs. On the enterprise level it may be offered as a module or functional addition to a [[human resources]] suite or Human Resource Information System (HRIS). The ATS is expanding into [[small and medium enterprises]] through [[open source software|open source]] or [[software as a service]] offerings (SaaS).

The principal function of an ATS is to provide a central location and database for a company's recruitment efforts. ATSs are built to better assist management of resumes and applicant information. Data is either collected from internal applications via the ATS front-end, located on the company website or is extracted from applicants on job boards. The majority of job and resume boards ([[LinkedIn|LinkedIn.com]], [[Monster.com]], [[Yahoo! HotJobs|Hotjobs]], [[CareerBuilder]], [[Indeed.com]]) have partnerships with ATS software providers to provide parsing support and ease of [[data migration]] from one system to another. Newer applicant tracking systems (often referred to as next generation) are platforms as a service whereby the main piece of software has integration points that allow providers of other recruiting technology to plug in seamlessly. The ability of these next generation ATS solutions allows jobs to be posted where the candidate is and not just on job boards. This ability is being referred to as Omnichannel Talent Acquisition.

Recent enhancements include use of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) tools and [[natural language processing]] to facilitate intelligent guided [[semantic search]] capabilities offered through cloud based platforms that allow companies to score and sort resumes with better alignment to the job requirements and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is Applicant Tracking Software?|url=http://ejobsitesoftware.com/blog/what-is-applicant-tracking-software/|accessdate=25 April 2016|work=ejobsitesoftware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of ATS, [[Resume Optimization|resume optimization]] techniques and online tools are now used by applicants to increase their chances of landing an interview call.

==Benefits== 
Functionality of an ATS is not limited to data mining and collection; ATS applications in the recruitment industry include the ability to automate the [[recruitment]] process via a defined [[workflow]].

Another benefit of an applicant tracking system is analyzing and coordinating recruitment efforts - managing the conceptual structure known as [[human capital]]. A corporate career site or company specific job board module may be offered, allowing companies to provide opportunities to internal candidates prior to external recruitment efforts. Candidates may be identified via pre-existing data or through information garnered through other means. This data is typically stored for search and retrieval processes. Some systems have expanded offerings that include off-site encrypted resume and data storage, which are often legally required by [[equal opportunity employment]] laws.

Applicant tracking systems may also be referred to as [[talent acquisition and management products]] (TAMP) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Younas|first=Mohammad|title=10 Features Every Career Portal Should Have Today|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/312441|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often provided via an application service provider or [[software as a service]] (SaaS) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levinson|first=Meridith|title=New Job Search Service Helps Job Seekers Penetrate Applicant Tracking Systems|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/enterprise/3341530/new-job-search-service-helps-job-seekers-penetrate-applicant-tracking-systems/|publisher=PC Advisor|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of service and cost can vary greatly across providers. In the UK and Ireland, Applicant Tracking Systems which are specifically for Agency Recruiters are often referred to as Recruitment Software and this is a term used mainly in the recruitment agency industry (representative bodies include the REC in the UK and the NRF in Ireland). Although proprietary systems dominate the ATS space, there are [[Free and open-source ATS|open-source alternatives]].

As the data held within recruitment software is predominantly personal data, it is often{{vague|date=May 2016}} tightly controlled by [[data protection]] legislation, preventing the data from being held offshore, which frequently places a legal restriction on the use of SaaS offerings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12139">'''Cabotage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|b|ə|t|ᵻ|dʒ|,_|-|t|ɑː|ʒ}}) is the [[transport]] of goods or passengers between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country. It originally applied to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, but now applies to [[aviation]], [[railways]], and [[road transport]] as well.

'''Cabotage rights''' are the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries do not permit aviation cabotage, and there are strict sanctions against it, for reasons of economic [[protectionism]], [[national security]], or [[public safety]]. One notable exception is the [[European Union]], whose Member States all grant cabotage rights to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2001_white_paper_en.htm |title="European transport policy for 2010: time to decide" EU Commission White paper |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927035247/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2001_white_paper_en.htm |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Cabotage originally meant simply [[Short sea shipping|coasting trade]], from the French ''caboter'', to travel by the coast. Its ultimate origin is uncertain. The air transport meaning is attested in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st edition, 1888, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/25785 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==In shipping==
Cabotage laws apply to merchant ships in most countries that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in congested territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adherence to the cabotage system|url=http://www.naiko-kaiun.or.jp/e/union/union10.html|publisher=Japan Federation of Coastal Shipping Associations|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the history of cabotage in UK law, see [[Navigation Acts]].

In the United States, the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]] (Jones Act) requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. The [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886]] states that no foreign vessels shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United States, either directly or by way of a foreign port.

[[Indonesia]] implemented a cabotage policy in 2005 after previously allowing foreign-owned vessels to operate relatively freely within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabotage provides a big  boost to shipping industry |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/09/23/cabotage-provides-a-big-boost-shipping-industry.html|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=The Jakarta Post|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1937) which is also known as the Cabotage Law restricts [[coastwise trade]] or the transport of passengers and goods within the country, to vessels with Philippine registry which has to secure a coastwise license from the [[Maritime Industry Authority]]. After the passage of Foreign Ships Co-Loading Act or the Republic Act No. 10668 in 2015, foreign vessels with cargo intended to be exported out the country may dock in multiple ports in the country before transiting to a foreign port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Republic Act No. 10668: Policy Considerations to Improve Coastwise Trade|url=http://industry.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Beyond-Republic-Act-No-10668-Policy-Considerations-to-Improve-Coastwise-Trade.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=Sector Planning Bureau of the Department of Trade and Industry|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the EU, rights to cabotage in newly-admitted Member States (in particular, Greece, Spain and Portugal) were restricted;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/exceptions-from-eu-free-movement-law-9781849466202/ EU derogations]&lt;/ref&gt; but this introductory provision was abandoned after criticism in the light of the Paros ferry disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekislandhopping.com/Updates/updatepages/u_disaster.html Paros ferry disaster] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xbfGMxu6?url=http://www.greekislandhopping.com/Updates/updatepages/u_disaster.html |date=2011-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hague–Visby Rules]], a convention which imposes duties on maritime carriers, apply only to "carriage of goods by sea between ports in two different states", and thus do not apply to cabotage shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby rules, Article X&lt;/ref&gt; However, section 1(3) of the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] declares that the Rules "shall have effect ... where the port of shipment is a port in the United Kingdom, whether or not the carriage is between ports in two different States ...".

==In passenger aviation==
Cabotage rights remain rare in passenger aviation. The [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|Chicago Convention]] prohibits member states from granting cabotage on an exclusive basis, which has limited the availability of cabotage as a bargaining chip in bilateral aviation agreement negotiations.&lt;ref name="havel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Havel|first1=Brian F.|title=The Principles and Practice of International Aviation Law|date=31 March 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107020528|pages=50–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8H2AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;ots=ShuKdGSAP2&amp;dq=chile%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabotage is not granted under most [[open skies]] agreements.

===European Union===
Carriers licensed under EU law are permitted to engage in cabotage in any EU member state, with some limitations.&lt;ref name="havel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/haulage/cabotage_en "Cabotage"] European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ryanair]], [[easyJet]], [[Vueling]], [[Wizz Air]], and [[Aer Lingus]] have bases and operate domestic services outside their home countries.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The [[Closer Economic Relations]] agreement allows Australian air carriers to fly domestically and internationally from [[New Zealand]] and vice versa. An Australian carrier, [[Jetstar]] (a [[Qantas]] subsidiary), flies domestic routes within New Zealand. [[Air New Zealand]] offers one international destination from Australia outside New Zealand, flying between [[Sydney]], Australia and [[Rarotonga]] of the [[Cook Islands]]. Previously, [[Jetconnect|Qantas Jetconnect]],  [[Pacific Blue Airlines|Pacific Blue]] (a [[Virgin Australia]] subsidiary) and [[Ansett New Zealand]] were Australian-owned airlines based in New Zealand that operated domestic New Zealand services.

Australia also permits foreign-owned airlines incorporated under Australian law (such as [[Tiger Airways Australia]] and the domestic arm of [[Virgin Australia]]) to operate on domestic routes, although it prohibits such airlines from operating international routes as Australian flag carriers.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt;

===Chile===
[[Chile]] has the most liberal cabotage rules in the world, enacted in 1979, which allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights, conditional upon reciprocal treatment for Chilean carriers in the foreign airline's country. This unusual regime is partly due to Chile's geographical need for air service, and partly to incentivize liberalization in other countries amid the international expansion of its flag carrier [[LATAM Chile]], which now has major operations in many other Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt; Like Australia, Chile allows foreign companies to set up Chilean subsidiaries to offer domestic flights in Chile, regardless of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0406:EN:NOT |title=Communication from the Commission – Strengthening aviation relations with Chile |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===

Before 1991, [[Lufthansa]] was prohibited from flying to [[West Berlin]], so [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[British Airways]], and [[Air France]] operated the routes between [[West Germany]] and West Berlin. For a short time in the late 1980s, [[Trans World Airlines]] also flew between then-West Germany and West Berlin. During this time, Pan&amp;nbsp;Am flew to Tegel, in Berlin, from [[Munich-Riem Airport]] (now closed) and Frankfurt. Air France flew from [[Düsseldorf]]. British Airways flew from [[Münster]]-[[Osnabrück]], [[Hannover]], and some other cities.

In 2003&amp;ndash;2004, the [[United States Department of Transportation]] authorized [[Polynesian Airlines]] to provide temporary cabotage service in [[American Samoa]] after the existing US flag carrier ceased operations, one of very few instances where the US has granted cabotage rights in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabotage definition and standards for emergency exemption|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/igia/2011/upload/20-AviationCabotageDOT.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October&amp;nbsp;2007, the [[United Kingdom]] granted [[Singapore]] carriers the right to fly domestic UK&amp;nbsp;routes as part of an [[open skies]] agreement, which also allows British carriers to fly to any city from Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/303608/1/.html |title=Channelnewsasia.com |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal cabotage rights exist by treaty between New Zealand and Brunei and between the People's Republic of China and Albania.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt;

==="Modified sixth freedom"===

The "modified [[freedoms of the air|sixth freedom]]" refers to the right to carry passengers between two points in country A through a hub in country B; for instance, a Boston-Toronto-Seattle itinerary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasigh|first1=Bijan|title=Introduction to Air Transport Economics: From Theory to Applications|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|pages=156–157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzPekWiS9I0C&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;ots=Abr6R5Ihxl&amp;dq=qantas%20new%20york%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such services are currently considered to constitute cabotage and are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Canada's new government delivers greater Air Travel choice through Open Skies agreement with the United States|publisher=[[Government of Canada]]|date=12 March 2007|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=283149|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the United States fined [[Asiana Airlines]] for selling tickets from the mainland US to [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]] via Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Compart|first1=Andrew|title=DOT fines Asiana for violating cabotage laws|url=http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/DOT-fines-Asiana-for-violating-cabotage-laws/|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=Travel Weekly|date=31 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tag rights===

Certain airlines operate services within a foreign country without the right to carry local traffic. For instance, [[Qantas]] operates service between New York and Los Angeles solely for use by international connecting passengers. Such services are not generally considered to be cabotage.

'''Chief information officer''' ('''CIO'''), '''chief digital information officer''' ('''CDIO''') or '''information technology''' ('''IT''') '''director''', is a job title commonly given to the most senior executive in an enterprise who works for the traditional [[information technology]] and computer systems that support enterprise goals.

Typically, the CIO reports directly to the [[chief executive officer]] but may also report to the [[chief operating officer]] or [[chief financial officer]].  In military organizations, they report to the [[commanding officer]]. The Chief Information Officer role was first defined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.williamgruber.com/strategic-information|title=williamgruber|website=williamgruber}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 by  William R. Synnott, former Senior Vice President of the Bank of Boston, and William H. Gruber, former professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;ref&gt;Synnott W.R. and Gruber W.H. (1981) Information Resource Management: Opportunities and Strategies for the 1980s. New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The need for CIOs==
CIOs or CDIOs form a key part of any business that utilizes technology and data. In recent times, it has been identified that an understanding of just business or just IT is not sufficient.&lt;ref name="Business Week"&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Simson|first1=Ernest|title=The new role of the CIO|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-22/the-new-role-of-the-cio|website=ww.businessweek.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs manage IT resources and plan "[[Information and communications technology|ICT]] including policy and practice development, planning, budgeting, resourcing and training”.&lt;ref name=Nottingham.ac.uk&gt;{{cite web|last1= University of Nottingham|title=The role of a Chief Information Officers (CIO) or equivalent Senior ICT Manager|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/gradschool/sict/toolkit/knowledge-base/ict-services/role-cio|website=www.nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, CIOs are becoming increasingly important in calculating how to increase profits via the use of ICT frameworks, as well as the vital role of reducing expenditure and limiting damage by setting up controls and planning for possible disasters. ''[[Computer Weekly]]'' magazine highlights that “53% of IT leaders report a shortage of people with high-level personal skills” in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Computer Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manwani|first1=Sharm|last2=Flint|first2=David|title=From manager to chief information officer|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/From-manager-to-chief-information-officer|website=www.computerweekly.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most organisations can't expect to fill demand for skilled resources and 57% of CIOs don't have the right learning and support mechanisms in place to enable current staff to meet the skill shortage.&lt;ref name="CIO WaterCooler"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIOWaterCooler - The Changing Shape of IT|url=https://ciowatercooler.co.uk/cio-survey-the-changing-shape-of-it|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs are needed to decrease the gulf between roles carried out by both IT professionals and non-IT professionals in businesses in order to set up effective and working relationships.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The Chief Information Officer of an organization is responsible for a number of roles. First and most importantly, the CIO must fulfill the role of business leader.&lt;ref name="Business Leader Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peppard|first1=Joe|title=Unlocking the Performance of the Chief Information Officer (CIO)|journal=California Management Review|date=August 2010|volume=52|issue=4|page=5|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/52640613/unlocking-performance-chief-information-officer-cio|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a CIO must make executive decisions regarding things such as the purchase of IT equipment from suppliers or the creation of new systems, they are therefore responsible for leading and directing the workforce of their specific organization. In addition, the CIO is ‘required to have strong organizational skills’.&lt;ref name="Roles and Responsibilities Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawry|first1=Rachel|last2=Waddell|first2=Dianne|last3=Singh|first3=Mohini|title=Roles, Responsibilities and Futures of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) in the Public Sector|date=2007|page=3|url=http://www.hadjarian.com/esterategic/tarjomeh/arzi1.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly relevant for a Chief Information Officer of an organization who must balance roles in order to gain a competitive advantage and keep the best interests of the organization's employees. CIOs also have the responsibility of recruiting, so it is important that they take on the best employees to complete the jobs the company needs fulfilling.

In addition, CIOs are directly required to map out both the ICT strategy and ICT policy of an organization. The ICT strategy covers future proofing, procurement, and the external and internal standards laid out by an organization. Similarly, the CIO must write up the ICT policy, detailing how ICT is utilized and applied. Both are needed for the protection of the organization in the short and long term and the process of strategizing for the future. Paul Burfitt, former CIO of [[AstraZeneca]], also outlines the CIO's role of IT governance, which he refers to as the “clarifying” of “accountability and the role of committees”.&lt;ref name="Roles and Responsibility Computer Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Computer Weekly|title=What exactly does a chief information officer do?|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240061366/What-exactly-does-a-chief-information-officer-do|website=www.computerweekly.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the CIO and their close cousin has become more closely involved in customer facing products. With the rising awareness in organisations that their customers are expecting digital services as part of their relationship with an organisation, CIOs have been tasked with product oriented responsibilities. Clear examples of this are seen at facilities management company MITIE where former CIO of energy firm Centrica Davi Cooper is the CTIO and has an agenda to create online services for their customers.&lt;ref name="CIO Interview: David Cooper, CTIO of Mitie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=CIO Interview: David Cooper, CTIO of Mitie|url=https://horizoncio.network/cio-interview-david-cooper-ctio-of-mitie|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks involved==
As the CIO has a large number of responsibilities such as provision of finance, recruitment of professionals and development of policy and strategy, the risks are consequently vast. The CIO of U.S company [[Target Corporation|Target]] was forced into resignation in 2014 after the theft of 40 million credit card details and 70 million customer details by hackers.&lt;ref name="CIO Resigntion Article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaas|first1=Lisa|title=Target CIO Beth Jacob resigns in breach aftermath|url=http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/03/06/target-cio-beth-jacob-resigns-in-breach-aftermath/|website=www.nakedsecurity.sophos.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs carry out a large number of roles and therefore the chance of failure is very high. In this way, any CIO must be knowledgeable about the industry so they can adapt and reduce the chance of error.

With the introduction of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) CIOs have now become increasingly focused on how their role is regulated and can lead to financial and reputation damage to a business.  However, regulations such as GDPR have also been advantageous to CIOs enabling them to have the budget and authority in the organisation to make significant changes to the way information is managed.  Sabah Khan-Carter of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp described GDPR as "a really big opportunity for most organisations".&lt;ref name="CIO Podcast: GDPR is a business opportunity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=CIO Podcast: GDPR is a business opportunity|url=https://horizoncio.network/cio-podcast-gdpr-is-a-business-opportunity|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information technology==
Information technology and its systems have become so important that the CIO has come to be viewed in many organizations as a key contributor in formulating [[strategic]] goals for an organization.  The prominence of the CIO position has greatly risen as information, and the information technology that drives it, has become an increasingly important part of the modern organization.  Many CIOs are adding additional [[c-level]] titles to reflect the growing importance of technology in successfully running companies; this trend is referred to as the [[CIO-plus]].  The CIO may be a member of the executive committee of an organization, and/or may often be required to engage at board level depending on the nature of the organization and its operating structure and governance environment.  No specific qualifications are intrinsic to the CIO position, though the typical candidate may have expertise in a number of technological fields - [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], or [[information systems]]. However, in healthcare there is a rising demand for CIOs to be qualified. The benefit of this is that they will then be seen as peers to their clinical peers and able to command greater respect and opportunity in the organisation.&lt;ref name="Healthcare CIOs chime agreement for professional recognition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=UK's leading NHS CIOs discuss the need for professional qualification|url=https://horizoncio.network/healthcare-cios-chime-agreement-for-professional-recognition/|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 Many candidates have [[Master of Business Administration]] or [[Master of Science in Management]] degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meridith Levinson |url=http://www.cio.com/article/122507/Should_You_Get_an_MBA_ |title=Should You Get an MBA? - CIO.com - Business Technology Leadership |publisher=CIO.com |date=2007-07-05 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, CIOs' leadership capabilities, business acumen and strategic perspectives have taken precedence over technical skills. It is now quite common for CIOs to be appointed from the business side of the organization, especially if they have [[project management]] skills.

Despite the strategic nature of the role, a 2017 survey, conducted by [[Logicalis]], of 890 CIOs across 23 countries found that 62% of CIOs spend 60% or more of their time on day to day IT activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicalis-thinkhub.com/|title=Logicalis CIO Survey 2017-2018 {{!}} Think Hub {{!}}|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=www.logicalis-thinkhub.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Gartner]] Executive Programs conducted a global CIO survey and received responses from 2,053 CIOs from 41 countries and 36 industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2304615|title=Gartner Executive Program Survey of More Than 2,000 CIOs Shows Digital Technologies Are Top Priorities in 2013 |publisher=Gartner |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gartner reported that survey results indicated that the top ten technology priorities for CIOs for 2013 were [[analytics]] and [[business intelligence]],  [[mobile technologies]], [[cloud computing]], [[Collaborative software|collaboration technologies]], [[Software modernization|legacy modernization]], [[IT management]], [[customer relationship management]], [[virtualization]], [[security]], and [[enterprise resource planning]].

''CIO'' magazine's "State of the CIO 2008" survey asked 558 IT leaders whom they report to.  The results were: [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] (41%), [[chief financial officer|CFO]] (23%), [[Chief operating officer|COO]] (16%), Corporate CIO (7%) and Other (13%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/147950/_State_of_the_CIO_2008_Data_Shows_CIO_Salaries_Influence_Rising |title=State of the CIO 2008 Data Shows CIO Salaries, Influence Rising |publisher=CIO |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a CIO is involved with driving the analysis and re-engineering of existing business processes, identifying and developing the capability to use new tools, reshaping the enterprise's physical infrastructure and network access, and with identifying and exploiting the enterprise's knowledge resources.  Many CIOs head the enterprise's efforts to integrate the Internet into both its long-term strategy and its immediate business plans. CIOs are often tasked with either driving or heading up crucial IT projects that are essential to the strategic and operational objectives of an organization.  A good example of this would be the implementation of an [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) system, which typically has wide-ranging implications for most organizations.

Another way that the CIO role is changing is an increased focus on service management.&lt;ref name="servMgmt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/558564/Recession_Shifts_IT_Service_Management_Into_Fast_Lane |title=CIO Magazine: Recession Shifts IT Service Management into Fast Lane |publisher=Cio.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[SaaS]], [[IaaS]], [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]] and other more flexible value delivery techniques are brought into organizations the CIO usually functions as a 3rd party manager for the organization.  In essence, a CIO in the modern organization is required to possess business skills and the ability to relate to the organization as a whole, as opposed to being a technological expert with limited functional business expertise.  The CIO position is as much about anticipating trends in the market place with regard to technology as it is about ensuring that the business navigates these trends through expert guidance and proper strategic IT planning that is aligned to the corporate strategy of the organization.

==Distinction between CIO, CDO and CTO==
The roles of Chief Information Officer, [[Chief Digital Officer]] and [[Chief Technology Officer]] are commonly blurred. Tom Silver, the North American senior vice president for Dice, states that CTOs are concerned with technology itself, often customer-facing, whereas CIOs are much more concerned with its applications in the business and how this can be managed.&lt;ref name="Oracle CTO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zetlin|first1=Minda|title=CIO or CTO- What's in a Title?|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/features/050110-ciocto-143658.html|website=www.oracle.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, CIOs manage a business's IT systems and functions, creates and delivers strategies and policies, and places great emphasis on internal customers. In contrast to this, CTOs place emphasis on the external customers to the organization and focus on how different technology can make the company more profitable.&lt;ref name="Tech Republic CTO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiner|first1=Jason|title=Sanity check: What's the difference between CIO and CTO?|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-sanity-check/sanity-check-whats-the-difference-between-cio-and-cto/|website=www.techrepublic.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional definition of CTOs focused on using technology as an external competitive advantage now includes CDOs who use the power of modern technologies, online design and [[big data]] to digitalise a business.

==Awards and recognition==

It is not uncommon for CIOs to be recognised and awarded annually, particularly in the technology space. These awards are commonly dictated by the significance of their contribution to the industry and generally occur in local markets only. Awards are generally judged by industry peers, or senior qualified executives such as the [[chief executive officer]], [[chief operating officer]] or [[chief financial officer]]. Generally awards recognise substantial impact to the local technology market.

In [[Australia]], the top 50 CIOs are recognised annually under the [[CIO50]] banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cio.com.au/cio50/|title=Home- CIO 50- CIO|website=CIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States|United States of America]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[New Zealand]] CIOs are recognised under the [[CIO100]] banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/category/cio100/|title=CIO 100 Symposium and Awards|website=CIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.co.uk/cio100/archive/|title=CIO 100 Archive - CIO UK|website=www.cio.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cio.co.nz/cio100nz/|title=CIO 100- CIO New Zealand|website=CIO New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognos ReportNet (CRN)''' is a web-based [[software]] product for creating and managing [[ad hoc]] and custom-made reports. ReportNet is developed by the [[Ottawa]]-based  company [[Cognos]] (formerly Cognos Incorporated), an [[IBM]] company. The web-based reporting tool was launched in September 2003. Since IBM's acquisition of Cognos, ReportNet has been renamed ''IBM Cognos ReportNet'' like all other Cognos products.

ReportNet uses web services standards such as [[XML]] and [[Simple Object Access Protocol]] and also supports dynamic [[HTML]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312025955/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2123232/bear-sterns-chooses-cognos-reportnet Cognos ReportNet in news]&lt;/ref&gt; ReportNet is compatible with multiple databases including [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Teradata]], [[Microsoft SQL server]], [[IBM DB2|DB2]] and [[Sybase]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/solutions/data/ibm/advantages.html Data sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024195555/http://www.cognos.com/solutions/data/ibm/advantages.html |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.cognos.com/en/support/products/crn101_software_environments.html CRN Environment details]&lt;/ref&gt; The product provides interface in over 10 languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/products/business_intelligence/reporting/features.html CRN Features] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330050308/http://www.cognos.com/products/business_intelligence/reporting/features.html |date=2008-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has Web Services architecture to meet the needs of multi-national, diversified enterprises and helps reduce total cost of ownership. Multiple versions of Cognos ReportNet have since been released by the company. Cognos ReportNet was awarded the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) 2005 [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]]s for the "Best Business Intelligence or Knowledge Management Solution" category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mywire.com/pubs/PRNewswire/2005/06/08/885642?extID=10051 Cognos ReportNet wins award]&lt;/ref&gt; CRN's capabilities have been further used in [[IBM Cognos 8 Business Intelligence|IBM Cognos 8 BI (2005)]], the latest reporting tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/products/cognos8businessintelligence Cognos 8 BI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415200240/http://www.cognos.com/products/cognos8businessintelligence/ |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CRN comes with its own [[software development kit]] (SDK).

==Launch==
Early adopters of Cognos ReportNet for their corporate reporting needs included [[Bear Stearns]], [[BMW]] and [[Alfred Publishing]]. Around this same time of launch, Cognos competitor [[Business Objects]] released version 6.1 of its enterprise reporting tool. Cognos ReportNet has been successful since its launch, raising revenues in 2004 from licensing fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131525446.html Cognos ReportNet delivers $30 Million in License Revenue in one Quarter]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other major corporations like [[McDonald's]] adopted Cognos ReportNet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebizq.net/news/5538.html ReportNet and fries]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Cognos rival [[Business Objects (company)|Business Objects]] announced in 2005 that BusinessObjects XI significantly outperformed Cognos ReportNet in benchmark tests conducted by VeriTest, an independent software testing firm. The tests performed showed Cognos ReportNet performed poorly when processing styled reports, complex business reports and combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crm2day.com/news/crm/114773.php BO XI Vs Cognos ReportNet]&lt;/ref&gt; The tests reported a massive 21 times higher report throughput for BusinessObjects XI than Cognos ReportNet at capacity loads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-4404821_ITM BO XI outperforms Cognos ReportNet]&lt;/ref&gt; Cognos soon dismissed the claims by stating Business Objects dictated the environment and testing criteria and Cognos did not provide the software to participate in benchmark test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/news/releases/2005/0624_3.html Cognos dismisses the Test results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405194220/http://www.cognos.com/news/releases/2005/0624_3.html |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognos later performed their own test to demonstrate Cognos ReportNet capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognos.com/pdfs/whitepapers/wp_cognos_reportnet_scalability_benchmakrs_ms_windows.pdf Cognos scalability results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707044816/http://www.cognos.com/pdfs/whitepapers/wp_cognos_reportnet_scalability_benchmakrs_ms_windows.pdf |date=2008-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="502">A '''Collateral Billing number''' (CBN) is a number that sometimes can be given in place of a [[purchase order]] or a [[credit card number]] to ensure a products return. For example, you receive a defective product and call the manufacturer, they in turn send you a replacement unit after collecting a purchase order, credit card or collateral billing number from you to charge the cost of the unit to in the event that you do not return the original unit.

'''CommunicAsia''' is an [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) exhibition and conference held in [[Singapore]].  The annual event has taken place since 1979 and is usually held in June.  The show customarily runs concurrently with the [[BroadcastAsia]] and [[EnterpriseIT]] exhibitions and conferences, all of which are operated by [[Singapore Exhibition Services]].

== Overview ==
The CommunicAsia Exhibition is amongst the largest platforms organised for the ICT industry in the Asia-Pacific region.  It draws global industry brands to showcase key and emerging technologies.  Past exhibitors include LG, Yahoo!,  Huawei, Skype, Research in Motion (Blackberry) and Samsung.  Attendance is restricted to trade professionals but admission is free.

The CommunicAsia Summit features roundtable discussions, forums and presentations on a broad range of industry specific subjects.  The summit draws participation from top experts and managers from the telecommunications, service provider and satellite sectors as well as senior government functionaries and regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attendee Profile|work=Communicasia.com|publisher=Singapore Exhibition Services|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">'''Completed staff work''' is a principle of [[management]] which states that subordinates are responsible for submitting written recommendations to superiors in such a manner that the superior need do nothing further in the process than review the submitted document and indicate approval or disapproval.

In Completed Staff Work, the subordinate is responsible for identifying the problem or issue requiring decision by some higher authority. In written form such as a memorandum, the subordinate documents the research done, the facts gathered, and analysis made of alternative courses of action. The memo concludes with a specific recommendation for action by the superior.

The earliest description of the concept of Completed Staff Work appears in [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] publications,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army (January 1953) ''Army Information Digest''&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources indicate its origin to be a decade earlier from the [[Canadian Army]]. Since its early military origin, it has subsequently found favor in police management texts in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal police administration by Institute for Training in Municipal Administration, 1961, Institute for Training in Municipal Administration, p.80-83&lt;/ref&gt;

James Webb, Director of the Bureau of the Budget (1946-1949), attributes the Doctrine of Completed Staff Work to President Harry S. Truman.&lt;ref name=Truman&gt;

However, a memo written and circulated by Briagadier General George A. Rehm, executive officer for the G-3, Operations section, attributes the policy to [[General MacArthur]]'s headquarters in the [[Douglas MacArthur in World War II|Southwest Pacific Areas]] during [[World War 2]].&lt;ref name=Rehm_memo20080928&gt;

In [[international law]], '''consularization''' is the act of [[authentication|authenticating]] any legal document by the [[consul (representative)|consul]] office, by the consul signing and affixing a red ribbon to the document. International trade shipments often require consular invoices and other documents that may need to be consularized include travel documents (such as a parental consent letter for persons under 18 traveling without a parent), [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]], and [[Power of attorney|powers of attorney]].

==Consular invoices==
A consular invoice is  a document, often in triplicate, submitted to the consul or embassy of a country to which goods are to be exported before the goods are sent abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelman, Edward G. (2006) ''Dictionary of international trade''. 7th edn. Petaluma, Calif. World Trade Press, p. 41. {{ISBN|1885073739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed documents then travel with the goods and enable the customs officials in the destination country to verify the quantity, value and nature of the goods on arrival. A fee may be charged by the consulate for the checking and approval of the documents.

At the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] round in 1952, it was proposed that consularization of commercial invoices be abolished. In 2005, the United States and Uganda submitted a proposal to the [[World Trade Organization]] to abolish consularization.

Alternative terms include ''konsularfaktura'' (German), ''facture consulaire'' (French), ''factura consular'' (Spanish), ''fattura consolare'' (Italian) and ''fatura consular'' (Portuguese Br.).&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelman, pp. 676-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contractor management''' is the managing of [[Outsourcing|outsourced work]] performed for an individual company. Contractor management implements a system that manages contractors' health and safety information, insurance information, training programs and specific documents that pertain to the contractor and the owner client. Most modern contracts require the effective use of [[contract management software]] to aid administration between multiple parties.

==Risk and control==
Risk increases with the loss of control from [[Outsourcing|outsourcing work]]. Keeping work in-house gives an Owner Client complete control over the production or services provided including quality, durability, and consistency. Outsourcing the work reduces the amount of control held over these aspects. While contracts and agreements can be set in place to control the end product, the Owner Client cannot have complete assurance that their requirements are being met.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/439.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With the continuing outsourcing of production, companies struggle to standardize their contractor management processes. Requirements and regulations from the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and other governing bodies are constantly changing. Companies need to have full visibility into the quality of work their hired contractors have performed in the past and are performing now, and this often proves difficult.

There are tools which may measure the contractor's level of performance. For example, many large refineries have integrated their gate access control system to a contractor management software.  This provides real-time access to the performance of the contractor workforce within the refinery.

==Components==
Effective contractor management relies first on a standardized prequalification form (PQF). {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} A quality prequalification form will also allow for customized functionality, as needed. The prequalification form ensures that the necessary steps are in place for a contractor to work safely and sustainably, prior to establishing an agreement, or allowing a [[vendor]] to come on-site.  

A pre-qualification form (or an explanation of the requirements) is provided before bidding or quoting to assure and include the requirements in workplans and budgets.

Specifically, the prequalification form will allow the organization to track the most importance aspect of contractor management –
[[Contractor ratings|contractor prequalification]] across these essential dynamics:
* Financial stability
* Regulatory citation history
* Safety and Health statistics and programs
* Environmental protection programs
* Background checks and Security programs
* Sustainability/ Social Responsibility background and programs, including Human Rights.
* Site-specific requirements (as needed)
* Major projects performed, including references
* The length of time the contractor has been in business
* Services performed, and a risk ranking based on the contractor’s trade
* Insurance coverage and limits, [[additional insured]], and waiver of subrogation

A thorough prequalification form with each of these components is used to verify incidence rates and ensures that the contractor’s insurance certification is in line with company requirements.

The prequalification form is then reviewed for OSHA logs &lt;ref&gt;“Occupational Safety and Health Administration” OSHA.org. Retrieved 11, April, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and Experience Modification Ratings (EMR) to unearth any inconsistencies and to verify the contractor license status. Finally, references are contacted to provide actual work history and experience to further certify that the contractor is prequalified for performing work at that location.

==Auditing==
Once the prequalification form has been filled out, the contractor must be monitored for compliance, this is a significant part of contractor management. An audit is conducted based on the services that are performed by the contractor and the risk associated with that service.

For contractors involved in a higher risk trade (e.g. electricians,&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Outlook Handbook” BLS.gov. Retrieved 11, April, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[lockout-tagout]] &lt;ref&gt;Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout)” OSHA.org. Retrieved 11, April, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and [[confined space]] workers &lt;ref&gt;Anatomy of Confined Spaces in Construction” OSHA.org. Retrieved 11, April, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;) the audit is an essential part of reviewing the contractor’s safety program. Many of these high risk workers are involved in potentially life-threatening situations and must demonstrate their ability to protect employees and their clients from harmful situations.

In order to determine that the contractor possesses an adequate understanding of both the work to be performed and the safety standards that must be followed, the following questions are asked:

# Is the Safety Program that is currently in place adequate?
# Has the written program Safety Program been implemented?
# Is the inspection of critical pieces of equipment being done?
# Does the program allow for customization in the program based on risk?
# Is the Safety Program specific to the contractor and the services provided?
# Are the essential programs addressed, based on the services that will be performed?
# Is there a method to ensure the training based on written programs is being conducted?
# Are Job Hazard Analyses (JHAs),&lt;ref&gt;Job Hazards Analysis FAQ” LBL.gov. Retrieved 11, April, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; job-site inspections and other hazard identification / mitigation techniques being used and documented?

These questions are then used as indicators to determine the contractor’s level of performance. The audit ensures that the contractor has prepared for, and is enforcing, safety guidelines in their everyday practices. Essentially, the audit provides a third-party confirmation that the information supplied in the prequalification form is both accurate and up-to-date.

==Database==
A database can be used to record and access the vendor data within a contractor management program. The database needs to be updated regularly, to ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed of any changes, particularly if the contractor management program is being used to eliminate subpar performers. The use of an online contractor management database facilitates the sharing of contractor data in a secure format with all necessary users, using 24-7/365 availability.

==Benefits==
The purpose of a contractor management program is to better centralize, qualify and monitor a contingent workforce. As a result of implementing a contractor management program, an organization can expect to experience some, or all, of the following advantages:

# Cost savings
# Better supplier/client relationships
# Higher quality contractors and suppliers
# Less paperwork for both owners and contractors.  Some contractor management programs are cloud based software platforms that allow contractors to manage their own permits, licenses, inductions, training records and other issues that facilitate organisational and regulatory compliance.
# Instant information sharing &amp; evergreen qualification
# Reduced risk – continuous improvement in loss control
# Moving towards using leading indicators vs. lagging indicators
# Contractor awareness with regulatory and best practices such as VPP &lt;ref&gt;Voluntary Protraction Programs” OSHA.org. Retrieved 11, April, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and PSM &lt;ref&gt;Process Safety Management” OSHA.org. Retrieved 11, April, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

These advantages are both immediate and long-standing.  A comprehensive web-based contractor management program from a reputable firm can provide a reliable basis for prequalifying contractors, vendors and other suppliers of goods and services.

==Mitigating risk==
There are two major considerations when managing contractors. First is deciding on the criteria for evaluation and second is developing an effective management process to evaluate these criteria. There are a number of criteria on which a contractor’s safety can be evaluated, such as historical and future trend information.

{{Financial risk types}}
'''Country risk''' refers to the risk of investing or lending in a country, arising from possible changes in the business environment that may adversely affect operating profits or the value of assets in the country. For example, financial factors such as currency controls, devaluation or regulatory changes, or stability factors such as mass riots, civil war and other potential events contribute to companies' operational risks. This term is also sometimes referred to as [[political risk]]; however, country risk is a more general term that generally refers only to risks affecting all companies operating within or involved with a particular country. 

Political risk analysis providers and credit rating agencies use different methodologies to assess and rate countries' comparative [[Peren-Clement Index|risk exposure]]. Credit rating agencies tend to use quantitative econometric models and focus on financial analysis, whereas political risk providers tend to use qualitative methods, focusing on political analysis. However, there is no consensus on methodology in assessing credit and political risks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">The term '''course of dealing''' is defined in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-303 UCC § 1-303(b)]. "Course of dealing," as defined in subsection (b), is restricted, literally, to a sequence of conduct between the parties previous to the agreement. A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a "[[course of performance]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cmt. 2, UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though, according to the [[parol evidence rule]], words and terms in a writing intended to be the final expression of the agreement of the parties may not be contradicted by extrinsic evidence of a prior or contemporaneous agreement, extrinsic evidence in the form of course of dealing nonetheless may be used to explain or supplement the writing. An [[integration clause]] in a contract, stating that the parties intend the writing to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement does not suffice to negate the importance of course of dealing, "because these are such an integral part of the contract that they are not normally disclaimed by general language in the [[merger clause]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Allapattah Servs. v. Exxon Corp.'', 61 F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1314 (S.D. Fla. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the common law, extrinsic evidence such as course of dealing could be considered only the written contract was ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;See, e,g, ''Pepcol Mfg. v. Denver Union Corp.'', 687 P.2d 1310, 1314 (Colo. 1984) ("It is only where the terms of an agreement are ambiguous or used in some special or technical sense not apparent from the contractual document itself that the court may look beyond the four corners of the agreement in order to determine the meaning intended by the parties.").&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, "Under the UCC, the lack of facial ambiguity in the contract language is basically irrelevant to whether extrinsic evidence ought to be considered by the court as an initial matter."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Amoco Prod. Co. v. W. Slope Gas Co.'', 754 F.2d 303, 307-08 (10th Cir. 1985). See also Cmt. 1(c), UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303: "This section definitely rejects the requirement that a condition precedent to the admissibility of the type of evidence specified in paragraph (a) is an original determination by the court that the language used is ambiguous.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of course of dealing will be disallowed, however, if it is "carefully negated" in the parties' contract by "specific and unequivocal" language.&lt;ref&gt;''Precision Fitness Equip., Inc. v. Nautilus, Inc.'', Civil Action No. 08-cv-01228-CMA-KLM, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13576, at *25 (D. Colo. Feb. 2, 2011) (collecting cases). In that case the parties carefully negated course of dealing by including the following sentence in the Agreement: "Past practice and terms of dealing between [Nautilus] and [Precision], or in the industry generally, shall not be used to .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. interpret the terms of this Agreement."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term is usually used in US contract law, where the parties' course of dealing helps the court to understand the intention of the contracting parties, it is also used elsewhere in the law. In US patent law the term is used to help interpret the meaning of words used in patent claims by examining the prosecution history of a patent to determine what meaning the applicant and patent examiner understood claim words to have. It has been observed in the [[Federal Circuit]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The prosecution history often proves useful in determining a patent's scope, for it reveals the course of dealing with the Patent Office, which may show a particular meaning attached to the terms, or a position taken by the applicant to ensure that the patent would issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 52 F.3d 967, 991 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (concurring opinion of Mayer, J).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''creative director''' is a position often found within the [[graphic design]], [[film]], [[music]], [[video game industry|video game]], [[fashion]], [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], or [[Show business|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well.

A creative director is a vital role in all of the arts and entertainment industries. In another sense, they can be seen as another element in any product development process. The creative director may also assume the roles of an art director, copywriter, or lead designer. The responsibilities of a creative director include leading the communication design, interactive design, and concept forward in any work assigned. For example, this responsibility is often seen in industries related to advertisement. The creative director is known to guide a team of employees with skills and experience related to graphic design, fine arts, motion graphics, and other creative industry fields. Some example works can include visual layout, brainstorming, and copywriting. To assume the role of a creative director, one must already have an existing set of skills and expertise in many areas. Often, these types of artists start up from the very beginning in fields that can relate to motion graphics, advertisement in television, and/or book (or magazine) publishing.

==Communication design==

===Advertising===
In the advertising industry, a creative director is determined to develop various marketing schemes and strategies for a company or client that he or she is hired by. Assuming one is hired by a company that is fairly well known and established, there would be some type of creative department or management that the director would work with. The creative director would also serve as the project manager that works directly with employers, and in most circumstances, they would be responsible for designing concepts for advertisements and other promotional needs for their client(s). Some examples of their duties involve [[copywriting]] and laying out chronological advertisement plans which explain the ongoing process of a project. It is important for an advertisement creative director to meet their goals at specific deadline with maximum efficiency as possible. To do so, they must be able to guide the creative department effectively from start to finish. Educational requirements of this position involve a blending of skills in business and journalism. To even be considered as a creative director, one would need to have a couple of years of experience in advertising (as little as five to as many as ten years).&lt;ref&gt;"Advertising Creative Director Job Description, Salary, and Training Information." 300+ Job Descriptions: Find Your Dream Job in 2011. N.p., n.d. Web. 1 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.jobdescriptions.net/business/advertising-creative-director/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copy writing or art directing positions. Familiarity with film-making techniques is also common. Creative directors rise to become executive creative directors or chief creative officers, a position with executive responsibility for the entire creative department, and some progress to chairman of a firm.

Creative directors usually possess a [[communication design]] or [[fine art]]s &amp; animation degree. Copywriters may have degrees in [[journalism]], [[language arts]], or media innovation, or may develop more emphasis on advertising copy writing while pursuing a communication design degree.

==Video games==
{{main|Video game producer}}
With the increased team sizes and more specialised disciplines in the games industry, certain game designers are titled as 'creative director', 'executive designer', or 'game director'. A creative director in a video game company is usually responsible for product development across a number of titles and is generally regarded as the prime design authority across the company's product range. Some examples are [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Sam Lake]], [[Neil Druckmann]], or [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] whose influence extends across more than one project.

The creative director has an important responsibility in this industry. The director must devise ideas to lead a video game project forward and many responsibilities involve working with various individuals or teams spread out within the entire project/video game production. This can include cross-functional collaboration with the various disciplines involved in games development. Academically speaking, a creative director is usually degree educated but there are some circumstances where a high school education strongly focusing on aspects such as art, graphics, [[computer science]], and math can be acceptable and provide some valuable insight to students who hope to aspire in this field of work. Some skills that a creative director working in the video game industry may have include proficiency in [[computer programming]] and graphic development (illustrations, fine art) and have excellent interpersonal and writing skills (since they deal with many other clients and management leaders). The exact skills a game director possesses will depend on their background in the industry. Creative director, or game director, is not usually an entry level position, but in a smaller studio it can be. This is more common in start up companies for instance though normally one would have to earn that role by showing their skills and development over a period of years. The entertainment industry is not always a meritocracy, however, and sometimes people just luck into or inherit such positions. Creative directors have often done their share of lower level startup positions such as internships or assisting other directors in art related work fields. It is all about advancing through the career chain, and once one has earned the position a creative director, they may be eligible to work for larger and more popular game developing companies depending on how successful they have been with past collaborative projects.&lt;ref&gt;Careers in focus:computer and video game design. 2nd ed. New York: Ferguson, 2009. p.17-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

{{Main|Production designer}}

The creative director in the film industry is referred to as the [[production designer]]. A production designer carries a large responsibility of designing the look of a movie. The job is similar to a creative director's role in the video game industry in that he or she manages a team of employees and has to consistently develop new ideas and methods of working. It is vital that designers in this field are able to produce expressive/creative ideas and translate them into something cinematic. Usually a certain sum of funds is distributed among different departments in the production of a film (in this case, the art department). Creative directors must decide on how to distribute and use the funds in the most efficient and effective way to ensure maximum quality in the films art department. An example can include the structuring of scenes and sets once a film begins to undergo the shooting process. During this process, it is important for creative directors to understand what props and effects should be used and how they should be used among various sets and scenes of the film. Some important qualifications that one should have include being able to manage teams, having expertise in design (specifically in theatre, interior sets and art design), being open minded to new ideas and methods in regards to organizing film sets, and having an understanding of coordinating among different departments in order to move a project towards success. A creative director in the film industry usually starts out in lower ranks of the chain, such as an assistant to other art directors and/or as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Department – Skillset." Welcome to Skillset – Skillset. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.skillset.org/film/jobs/productiondesign&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music director}}
Creative directors in the field of music can be broken down into various key roles that make up the whole (it may be said that one can be known as a 'music director'). It is in this artistic field where the individual, the director, must master tasks that are relatable to one another. An orchestral conductor is a prime example (but not exclusive) of this role and how one would direct music and harmonize symphonies as well as guide/direct other musician’s in an ensemble. The three roles in this sense can consist of: the active [[musician]], the musical art director, and the instructor that teaches and informs music for society. The main requirements one would need to have is an extensive background and knowledge of music (being able to master one or more instrument), understanding the principles and theories behind music composition, developing an understanding and connection with musicians that the director would be working with to communicate music in a harmonic and creative sense, and most importantly being able to develop leadership skills among other musicians.&lt;ref&gt;"Traits and Skills of a Music Director – League of American Orchestras."

==Fashion==
Creative director is the highest creative position in a [[Fashion design|fashion house]]. The creative director does not design clothes, but instead formulates and impresses upon the designers an overarching concept or concepts for a certain collection and the label as a whole. 
A fashion creative director's main role is to establish what designs should be created, what will appeal to the target market, and how the concepts will be applied and distributed in collaboration with fashion designers who are responsible for creating the clothing and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Director: Inside Jobs."

They may variously also be referred to as the [[cultural industry|cultural industries]] (especially in Europe {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=14}} or the creative economy {{harv|Howkins|2001}}, and most recently they have been denominated as the Orange Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean ([http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896 Buitrago &amp; Duque 2013]).

Howkins' creative economy comprises [[advertising]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[crafts]], [[design]], [[fashion]], [[film industry|film]], [[music industry|music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]], [[research and development|R&amp;D]], [[software]], [[toy]]s and [[game]]s, [[Television|TV]] and [[radio]], and [[video game]]s {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. Some scholars consider that education industry, including public and private services, is forming a part of creative industry.&lt;ref&gt;Kultur &amp; Kommunikation for Nordic Innovation Centre (2007), [http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf "Creative Industries Education in the Nordic Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518105107/http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}; Mœglin, Pierre (2001), Les Industries éducatives, Paris, Puf&lt;/ref&gt; There remain, therefore, different definitions of the sector {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv| DCMS| 2006}}.

The creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that "[[human creativity]] is the ultimate economic resource" {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002|p=xiii}}, and that "the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation" {{Harv|Landry|Bianchini|1995|p=4}}.

==Definitions==
Various commentators have provided varying suggestions on what activities to include in the concept of "creative industries" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}{{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|pp=11–12}}, and the name itself has become a contested issue – with significant differences and overlap between the terms "creative industries", "cultural industries" and "creative economy" {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=11–14}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=12}}.

Lash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an "irreducible core" concerned with "the exchange of finance for rights in [[intellectual property]]", {{harv|Lash|Urry|1994|p=117}}. This echoes the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:

:"those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}

{{As of | 2015}} the DCMS definition recognizes nine ''creative sectors'', namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|title=Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport – Creative Industries Economic Estimates January 2015|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=13 January 2015|website=gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=16 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210124534/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Advertising]] and [[marketing]]
# [[Architecture]] &lt;!--and [[landscaping]] (e.g. [https://www.salford.gov.uk/d/Development_Prospectus.pdf Development prospectus])--&gt;
# [[Crafts]]
# [[Design]]: [[product design|product]], [[graphic design|graphic]] and [[fashion design]]&lt;!--(see also [[communication design]])--&gt;
# [[film]], [[Television|TV]], [[Videography|video]], [[radio]] and [[photography]]
# [[Information technology|IT]], [[software engineering|software]] and [[computer services]]
# [[Publishing]]
# [[Museum]]s, [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[libraries]]
# [[Music industry|Music]], [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts]]

To this list [[John Howkins]] would add [[toys]] and games, also including the much broader area of [[research and development]] in science and technology {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. It has also been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that [[gastronomy]] belongs in such a list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|title=Does cuisine have a place in the Creative Economy and what role does Creative Leadership play in its production?|author=|date=18 May 2011|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503134414/https://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fields of [[engineering]] do not appear on this list, that emerged from the DCMS reports. This was due, probably, to the fact that engineers occupy relevant positions in "non-cultural" corporations, performing activities of project, management, operation, maintenance, risk analysis and supervision, among others. However, historically and presently, several tasks of engineers can be regarded as highly creative, inventive and innovative. The contribution of engineering is represented by new products, processes and services.

Hesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms "the core cultural industries" of [[advertising]] and marketing, [[broadcasting]], [[Film industry|film]], internet and [[Music industry|music]] industries, [[publishing|print]] and [[electronic publishing]], and [[computer games|video and computer games]]. His definition only includes those industries that create "texts"' or "cultural artefacts" and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=12–14}}.

The DCMS list has proven influential, and many other nations{{which|date=June 2013}} have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that the division into sectors obscures a divide between [[lifestyle business]], non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade often comes into question, since it does not generally involve production (except of reproductions and fakes). The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned {{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=13}}.

Some areas, such as [[Hong Kong]], have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the [[value chain]]. They adopt the [[WIPO]]'s classifications, which divide up the creative industries according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production and distribution of creative content.

The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) has denominated them for Latin America and the Caribbean as the Orange Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|title=The Orange Economy: An Infinite Opportunity|first1=Buitrago Restrepo, Pedro|last1=Felipe|first2=Duque Márquez,|last2=Iván|date=1 October 2013|website=iadb.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110092916/http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as the "group of linked activities through which ideas are transformed into cultural goods and services whose value is determined by intellectual property."

Others{{who|date=June 2013}} have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment ([[visual arts]]; [[performing arts]]; cultural heritage).

==How creative workers are counted==
The DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music [[industrial sector]], and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a [[musician]].

The primary purpose of this is to quantify – for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.

It leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.

The total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:

* All workers employed in creative industries, whether or not creatively occupied (e.g. all musicians, security guards, cleaners, accountants, managers, etc. working for a record company)
* All workers that are creatively occupied, and are not employed in creative industries (for example, a piano teacher in a school). This includes people whose second job is creative, for example somebody who does weekend [[Gig (musical performance)|gigs]], writes books, or produces artwork in their spare time

==Properties or characteristics==
[[File:Township Cat.JPG|thumb|200px|A toy cat produced in a South-African township, made from used plastic bags and old wire]]

According to Caves (2000), creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:

#''Nobody knows principle'': Demand uncertainty exists because the consumers' reaction to a product are neither known beforehand, nor easily understood afterward.
#''Art for art's sake'': Workers care about originality, technical professional skill, harmony, etc. of creative goods and are willing to settle for lower wages than offered by 'humdrum' jobs.
#''Motley crew principle'': For relatively complex creative products (e.g., films), the production requires diversely skilled inputs. Each skilled input must be present and perform at some minimum level to produce a valuable outcome.
#''Infinite variety'': Products are differentiated by quality and uniqueness; each product is a distinct combination of inputs leading to infinite variety options (e.g., works of creative writing, whether poetry, novel, screenplays or otherwise).
#''A list/B list'': Skills are vertically differentiated. Artists are ranked on their skills, originality, and proficiency in creative processes and/or products. Small differences in skills and talent may yield huge differences in (financial) success.
#''Time flies'': When coordinating complex projects with diversely skilled inputs, time is of the essence.
#''Ars longa'': Some creative products have durability aspects that invoke [[copyright]] protection, allowing a creator or performer to collect rents.

The properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by 'art for art's sake'. The 'ars longa' property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The 'time flies' property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.

==Difference from the 'cultural industries'==
There is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of '''[[Cultural industry|cultural industries]]'''. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on [[cultural tourism]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]], [[sports]] and [[outdoor activities]], and a variety of 'way of life' activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of [[Hobbies|hobbyist]] concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also [[Cultural Institutions Studies|cultural institutions studies]].)

==The creative class==
Some authors, such as the American [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]], argue for a wider focus on the products of [[knowledge workers]], and judge the '[[creative class]]' (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services.

===The creative class and diversity===
Florida's focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative [[workforce]]. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the '[[creative class]]' provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[multiculturalism]] in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance. {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002}}

==Economic contribution==
Globally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific [[research and development]] are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world's economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific [[Research and Development]] suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.

Taking the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than [[hospitality]] or [[utilities]] and deliver four times the output due to [[agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK's [[working population]], though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

Within the creative industries sector and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are [[design]], [[publishing]], and [[television]] and [[radio]]. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.

The complex [[supply chains]] in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the [[gross value added]] by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as [[advertising]], whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as [[crafts]]. Not surprisingly, perhaps, competition in product-focused areas tends to be more intense with a tendency to drive the production end of the supply chain to become a [[commodity business]].

There may be a tendency for publicly funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person's profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs.  Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.

The creative industries in Europe make a significant contribution to the EU economy, creating about 3% of EU GDP – corresponding to an annual market value of €500 billion – and employing about 6 million people. In addition, the sector plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, in particular for devices and networks. The EU records the second highest TV viewing figures globally, producing more films than any other region in the world. In that respect, the newly proposed [[Creative Europe|'Creative Europe' programme]] (July 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|title=Creative Europe - European Commission|author=|date=|website=Creative Europe|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430180132/http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|archivedate=30 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will help preserve cultural heritage while increasing the circulation of creative works inside and outside the EU. The programme will play a consequential role in stimulating cross border co-operation, promoting peer learning and making these sectors more professional. The Commission will then propose a financial instrument run by the European Investment Bank to provide debt and equity finance for cultural and creative industries. The role of the non-state actors within the governance regarding Medias will not be neglected anymore. Therefore, building a new approach extolling the crucial importance of a European level playing field industry may boost the adoption of policies aimed at developing a conducive environment, enabling European companies as well as citizens to use their imagination and creativity – both sources of innovation -, and therefore of competitiveness and sustainability. It supposes to tailor the regulatory and institutional frameworks in supporting private-public collaboration, in particular in the Medias sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }} with Violaine Hacker&lt;/ref&gt; The EU therefore plans to develop clusters, financing instruments as well as foresight activities to support this sector. The European Commission wishes to assist European creators and audiovisual enterprises to develop new markets through the use of digital technology, and asks how policy-making can best help achieve this. A more entrepreneurial culture will have to take hold with a more positive attitude towards risk-taking, and a capacity to innovate anticipating future trends. Creativity plays an important role in human resource management as artists and creative professionals can [[Lateral thinking|think laterally]]. Moreover, new jobs requiring new skills created in the post-crisis economy should be supported by labour mobility to ensure that people are employed wherever their skills are needed.

===In the US===
In the introduction to a 2013 special issue of ''Work and Occupations'' on artists in the US workforce, the guest editors argue that by examining the work lives of artists, one can identify characteristics and actions that help both individual workers and policy makers adapt to changing economic conditions.  Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper cite multiple sources to suggest artists' skill sets allow them to "work beyond existing markets and create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }}, in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Lingo and Tepper suggest artistic workers are "catalysts of change and innovation" because they "face special challenges managing ambiguity, developing and sustaining a relative identity, and forming community in the context of an individually based enterprise economy" (2013). Because of these adaptive skills, the suggestion is that "studying how artists cope with uncertainty and the factors that influence their success should be relevant for understanding these broader social and economic trends facing today's (and tomorrow's) workforce."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }} in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of artist-as-change-agent changes the questions researchers ask of creative economies. Old research questions would focus on topics like "skills, work practices, contracts, wage differentials, employment incentives, formal credentials, employment pipelines, and labor flows of differentiated occupational categories". Examples of new questions include:
# How do artists both create changes in the labor market itself and the way cultural work is done?
# What is their process of innovation and enterprise?
# What is the nature of their work and the resources they draw upon?
# How do different network structures produce different opportunity spaces?
# How do artistic workers create and manage planned serendipity—the spaces and exchanges that produce unexpected collaborations and opportunities? 
# How do creative workers broker and synthesize across occupational, genre, geographic, and industry boundaries to create new possibilities? (Tepper &amp; Lingo, 2013)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Wider role==
As some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as [[manufacturing]], many now see the creative industry as a key component in a new [[knowledge economy]], capable perhaps of delivering [[urban regeneration]], often through initiatives linked to exploitation of [[cultural heritage]] that leads to increased [[tourism]]. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the [[United Kingdom]] will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer [[creative entrepreneurship]] as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK's creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in £112.5 billion to the UK economy (DCMS ''Creative Industries Mapping Document'' 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.

In recent years, creative industries have become 'increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world'.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stuart, Ryan, Mark David, Keane, Michael &amp; Ordonez, Diego (2008), ‘Financing Creative Industries in Developing Countries’, in Diana Barrowclough and Zeljka Kozul-Wright eds, [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf "Creative Industries and Developing Countries: Voice, Choice and Economic Growth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050038/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, Routledge, London and New York, pp. 65-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham ''et al.'' (2009) put it, 'the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy'. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises. Reflecting the growing interest in the potential of creative industries in developing countries, in October 2011 a Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy was created within the Indonesian government with well-known economist [[Mari Pangestu|Dr Mari Pangestu]] appointed as the first minister to hold the position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2226">'''Critical process parameters''' (CPP) in pharmaceutical manufacturing are key variables affecting the production process. CPPs are attributes that are monitored to detect deviations in standardized production operations and product output quality or changes in [[Critical Quality Attributes]]. Those attributes with a higher impact on CQAs should be prioritized and held in a stricter state of control. The manufacturer should conduct test to set acceptable range limits of the determined CPPs and define acceptable process variable variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Determining Criticality-Process Parameters and Quality Attributes Part I: Criticality as a Continuum|url=http://www.biopharminternational.com/biopharm/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=830461&amp;pageID=1|publisher=biopharminternational|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operational conditions within this range are considered acceptable operational standards. Any deviation from the acceptable range will be indicative of issues within the process and the subsequent production of substandard products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Process Parameters and Critical Quality Attributes: Why Does the Selection Process Take so Long?|url=http://www.propharmagroup.com/blog/critical-process-parameters-and-critical-quality-attributes-why-does-selection-process-take-so|publisher=ProPharma Group|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data relating to CPP should be recorded, stored, and analyzed by the manufacturer. CPP variables and ranges should be reevaluated after careful analysis of historical CPP data. Identifying CPPs is done in stage one of [[Process Validation]]: [[Process design]] are an essential part of a manufacturing control strategy.

One method of defining CPPs is to look at the effect of certain production processes on critical quality attributes. Those production parameters which have a measurable effect on those quality attributes that have been identified as critical can be considered CPPs and must always be in a state of control.

In 2014 the value of the ''daigou'' business just in luxury goods increased from [[Renminbi|CN¥]]55 billion to CN¥75 billion [[RMB|yuan]] (USD $8.8 billion to $12 billion).&lt;ref name="Chitrakorn2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chitrakorn |first1=Kati |title=Can China End the Illicit ‘Daigou’ Trade? |url= http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/global-currents/can-china-put-an-end-to-the-illicit-daigou-trade |website=businessoffashion.com |accessdate=October 28, 2016 |date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Daigou'' purchases are often from luxury brand boutiques in major fashion cities like [[Paris]], [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Seoul]].

Asian-American sales associates at   [[Macy's Herald Square]]  sued [[Macy's]] for [[racial discrimination]] in September 2017, alleging that store managers instructed sales associates not to sell more than one unit to any single  Asian customer, and that they were fired when they  spoke up about the alleged discrimination.&lt;ref&gt; Kimberly Yam, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/macys-profiling-asian-shoppers-lawsuit_us_59c12e73e4b0186c2205dc2a Former Macy’s Employees Sue Company For Allegedly Racially Profiling Asian Shoppers] [[huffingtonpost.com]] 09/19/2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9655">'''Decision-making software''' ('''DM software''') is a term for computer applications that help individuals and organisations make choices and take decisions, typically by ranking, prioritizing or choosing from a number of options.

An early example of DM software was described in 1973.&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;Dyer, JS (1973), "A time-sharing computer program for the solution of the multiple criteria problem", ''Management Science'', 19: 1379-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal"&gt;Wallenius, J, Dyer, JS, Fishburn, PC, Steuer, RE, Zionts, S and Deb, K (1992), "Multiple criteria decision making, multiattribute utility theory: The next ten years", ''Management Science'', 38: 645-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], most DM software was spreadsheet-based,&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal" /&gt; with the first web-based DM software appearing in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Koksalanetal"&gt;Koksalan, M, Wallenius, J, and Zionts, S, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Making: From Early History to the 21st Century'', World Scientific Publishing: Singapore, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, many DM software products (mostly web-based) are available&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal"&gt;Weistroffer, HR, and Li, Y, "Multiple criteria decision analysis software", Ch 29 in: Greco, S, Ehrgott, M and Figueira, J, eds, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys Series'', Springer: New York, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orms"&gt;Oleson, S (2016), [http://www.orms-today.org/surveys/das/das.html "Decision analysis software survey"], ''OR/MS Today'' 43(5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishizaka"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1002/9781118644898| title = Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis| year = 2013| last1 = Ishizaka | first1 = A. | last2 = Nemery | first2 = P. | isbn = 9781118644898}}&lt;/ref&gt; – e.g. see the comparison table below.

Most DM software focuses on ranking, prioritizing or choosing from among alternatives characterized on multiple criteria or attributes.&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; Thus most DM software is based on [[decision analysis]], usually [[multi-criteria decision-making]], and so is often referred to as "decision analysis"&lt;ref name="orms" /&gt; or "multi-criteria decision-making"&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; software – commonly shortened to "decision-making software". Some [[decision support systems]] include a DM software component.

==Purpose==
DM software can assist decision-makers “at various stages of the decision-making process, including problem exploration and formulation, identification of decision alternatives and solution constraints, structuring of preferences, and tradeoff judgements.”&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt;

The purpose of DM software is to support the analysis involved at these various stages of the decision-making process, not to replace it. DM software "should be used to support the process, not as the driving or dominating force."&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart"&gt;Belton, V, and Stewart, TJ, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: An Integrated Approach'', Kluwer: Boston, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

DM software frees users "from the technical implementation details [of the decision-making method employed], allowing them to focus on the fundamental value judgements".&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt; Nonetheless, DM software should not be employed blindly. "Before using a software, it is necessary to have a sound knowledge of the adopted methodology and of the decision problem at hand."&lt;ref name="Figueiraetal"&gt;Figueira, J, Greco, S and Ehrgott, M, "Introduction", Ch 1 in: Figueira, J, Greco, S and Ehrgott, M, eds, ''Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys Series'', Springer: New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and features==

===Decision-making methods===
As mentioned earlier, most DM software is based on [[multi-criteria decision making]] (MCDM). MCDM involves evaluating and combining alternatives' characteristics on two or more criteria or attributes in order to rank, prioritize or choose from among the alternatives.&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal2008"&gt;Wallenius, J, Dyer, JS, Fishburn, PC, Steuer, RE, Zionts, S and Deb, K (2008), "Multiple criteria decision making, multiattribute utility theory: Recent accomplishments and what lies ahead", ''Management Science'' 54: 1336-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

DM software employs a variety of MCDM methods;&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt; popular examples include:
* [[Aggregated Indices Randomization Method]] (AIRM)
* [[Analytic Hierarchy Process]] (AHP)
* [[Analytic network process]] (ANP, an extension of AHP)
* [[ELECTRE|Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality]] (ELECTRE)
* [[Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH)]]
* [[Multi-attribute global inference of quality]] (MAGIQ)
* [[Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives]] (PAPRIKA)
* [[Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation]] (PROMETHEE)
* [[Evidential reasoning approach]] for MCDM under hybrid uncertainty

There are significant differences between these methods&lt;ref name="BeltonandStewart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walleniusetal2008" /&gt; and, accordingly, the DM software implementing them. Such differences include:
:# The extent to which the decision problem is broken into a [[hierarchy]] of sub-problems;
:# Whether or not [[pairwise comparisons]] of alternatives and/or criteria are used to elicit decision-makers' preferences;
:# The use of [[interval scale]] or [[ratio scale]] measurements of decision-makers' preferences;
:# The number of criteria included;
:# The number of alternatives evaluated, ranging from a few (finite) to infinite;
:# The extent to which numerical scores are used to value and/or rank alternatives;
:# The extent to which incomplete rankings (relative to complete rankings) of alternatives are produced;
:# The extent to which uncertainty is modeled and analyzed.

===Software features===
In the process of helping decision-makers to rank, prioritize or choose from among alternatives, DM software products often include a variety of features and tools;&lt;ref name="Koksalanetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weistrofferetal" /&gt; common examples include:
*[[Pairwise comparison]]
*[[Sensitivity analysis]]
*Group evaluation (teamwork)
*Web-based implementation

===Comparison of decision-making software===
DM software includes the following notable examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9870">'''Departmentalization''' (or '''departmentalisation''') refers to the process of grouping activities into departments. [[Division of labour]] creates [[Expert|specialist]]s who need [[:wikt:coordination|coordination]]. This coordination is facilitated by grouping specialists together in departments.

==Popular types of departmentalization==
* '''Functional departmentalization''' - Grouping activities by functions performed. Activities can be grouped according to function (work being done) to pursue economies of scale by placing employees with shared skills and knowledge into departments for example human resources, IT, accounting, manufacturing, logistics, and engineering.  Functional departmentalization can be used in all types of organizations. Group activities in accordance with the function of an enterprise
* '''[[Product (business)|Product]] departmentalization''' - Grouping activities by product line. c  cs can also be grouped according to a specific product or service, thus placing all activities related to the product or the service under one manager. Each major product area in the corporation is under the authority of a senior manager who is specialist in, and is responsible for, everything related to the product line.  LA Gear is an example of company that uses product departmentalization.  Its structure is based on its varied product lines which include women’s footwear etc.
* '''[[Customer]] departmentalization''' - Grouping activities on the basis of common customers or types of customers. Jobs may be grouped according to the type of customer served by the organization. The assumption i c s that customers in each department have a common set of problems and needs that can best be met by specialists.  The sales  activities in an office supply firm can be broken down into three department c cs that serve retail, wholesale and government accounts.
* '''[[Geographic]] departmentalization''' - Grouping activities on the basis of territory. If an organization's customers are geographically dispersed, it can group jobs based on geography.  For example, the organization structure of Coca-Cola has reflected the company’s operation in two broad geographic areas – the North American sector and the international sector, which includes the Pacific Rim, tc cc he European Community, Northeast Europe, Africa and Latin America groups.
* '''[[Business process|Process]] departmentalization''' - Grouping activities on the basis of product or service or customer flow. Because each process requires different skills, process departmentalization allows homogeneous activities to be grouc c cped together.  For example, the applicants might need to go through several departments namely validation, licensing and treasury, before r c c ceceiving the driver’s license.
* '''[[Division (business)|Divisional]] departmentalization''' - When the firm develops independent lines of business that operate as separate companies, all contributing to the corporation profitability, the design is called divisional departmentalization or (M-FORM). For example, the Limited. Inc., has these divisions: Th Limited, Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Mast Industries.

Owing to the complexity of tasks and the competitive environment in which organisations operate, they often use a combination of the above-mentioned methods in departmentalization.

==Some philosophical considerations==
As March and Simon (1958) noted when tracing a first approach to departmentalization back to Aristotle (Politics, Book IV, Chap. 15), the problem of distributing work, authority and responsibility throughout an organization is hardly new. In modern times, Gulick and Urwick (1937) were the first to introduce a theory of different departmentalization strategies, which were referred to as ''departmentalization by purpose'' and ''departmentalization by process''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”First [organization by major process] ... by bringing together in a single office a large amount of each kind of work (technologically measured), makes it possible in the most effective divisions of work and specialization. Second, it makes possible also the economies of the maximum use of labor saving machinery and mass production.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... there is danger that an organization erected on the basis of purpose will fail to make use of the most up-to-date technical devices and specialists because ... there may not be enough work of a given technical sort to permit efficient subdivision.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Is there any advantage in placing specialized services like private secretaries or filing in [process departments]? In a very small organization, yes; in a large organization, no. In a small organization, where there is not a full-time job on some days for a secretary, it is better to have a central secretarial pool than to have a private secretary for each man. In a large organization, the reverse is true.” (Gulick &amp; Urwick, 1937)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Studying the above characterizations of the two forms of departmentalization we note that purpose decentralization is concerned with building work around specific products, customers, or geographic locations, while process departmentalization encompasses the efficiency of ”production”. March and Simon (1958) described the basic difference between the two ways of departmentalization as following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”Process departmentalization generally takes greater advantage of the potentialities for economy of specialization than does purpose departmentalization: purpose departmentalization leads to greater self-containment and lower coordination costs than process departmentalization.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

| '''Author's note:''' Please keep in mind that the content of the term "process" as it is used today in concepts such as Business Process Management or Business Process Reengineering differs significantly from its use by Gulick and Urwick. While G. and U. refer to functional decomposition when using the term "departmentalization by process", process orientation in today's meaning is more comparable to what G. and U. refer to as "purpose departmentalization".
|}

When taking a closer look at the three ways of departmentalization by purpose–product, customer, and location–we note that there are some specific advantages related to it.

First, self-containment tends to improve the ability for internal coordination within the unit. At the same time, the need for developing and maintaining extensive external coordination mechanisms is reduced.

Second, a clearer focus on the purpose itself–serving a specific customer or market–is enabled. On the other hand, the sense of independence may result in a drift-off from the achievement of the overall objectives of the organization. Therefore, several authors have emphasized the need for establishing control systems that serve the purpose of allowing decentralized decisions, while still aligning all sub-units to the overall goals of the organization (Drucker 1954, Koontz &amp; O’Donnell, 1964).

Departmentalization by process, on the other hand, seeks to benefit from the advantages that are found in high specialization, and tends to be very efficient in some instances. A high degree of specialization leads to the development of proficiency and professional competence, as well as it enables, and implies, the development of centralized control functions.

On the other hand, the problem of aligning individual and organizational goals remains. In addition, in this case, we would also need to consider departmental goals. Also, the high level of specialization is a barrier for the flexible reallocation of resources within the organization, i.e. people can not perform other tasks than those they are working with in their functional occupation. The most common way of process departmentalization is the division of the firm into business functions, such as purchasing, manufacturing, sales, accounting, etc.

Looking at the circumstances encompassing the use of either of the departmentalization strategies, we find that departmentalization by process generally is advantageous in cases of stable environments, while departmentalization by purpose, featuring self-containment and certain amounts of independence, appears to be the appropriate strategy for handling changing or unpredictable circumstances. [[Alfred D.. Chandler|Alfred Chandler]] (in: March and Simon, 1958) identified a correlation between the application of purpose departmentalization and the use of a diversification strategy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
”The dominant centralized structure had one basic weakness. A very few men were still entrusted with a great number of complex decisions. ... As long as an enterprise belonged in an industry whose market, sources of raw materials, and production processes remained relatively unchanged, few entrepreneurial decisions have to be reached. In that situation, such a weakness was not critical, but where technology, market, and sources of supplies were changed rapidly, the defect of such a structure became more obvious.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recent trends in departmentalization==
* The customer departmentalization has become increasingly emphasized.
* Rigid departmentalization is being complemented by the use of teams that cross over traditional departmental lines ("silos").

The '''diagnostic enterprise method''' is a [[management theory]] whose methods were created based on [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s principles to develop new ways in which companies can change their internal structure without outside help. Some of the techniques bring the managers the advantage to find opportunity areas in the company to correct them without affecting the enterprise development. This methods can be applied without big costs in money, time and training. This method can be applied to almost any [[Business|enterprise]].

== Frederick Taylor==
[[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] is considered the father of [[scientific management]]. Taylor evolved from a simple [[Shop floor|floor worker]] to be the boss in a former company. He considered that the management techniques would determine the best way to divide the tasks inside an enterprise. The methods developed by Taylor began with experiments counting the time it takes for a machine to produce an object. He thought that this method could be applied to every worker in the enterprise. This method came when the economy and the efficiency of the enterprise was below the standards.&lt;ref name="One Best Way: Frederick Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kanigel |first1=Robert |title=One Best Way: Frederick Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency |url=http://0-search.ebscohost.com.millenium.itesm.mx/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=buh&amp;AN=20458974&amp;site=bsi-live |accessdate= November 3, 2010 |volume= 48 |date=April 2006|publisher= |isbn= |pages=295–297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taylor's steps of management===
Taylor established four principles to increase efficiency at the workplace. Although these principles were established a long time ago they are still used to resolve [[efficiency]] problems. The First principle is to analyze the way in which every worker does the task given. With all the information united, build a new improved plan of activities. This principle is based in the study of time-[[cost]] and time of delivery. The second principle consists in making a new method and give it as a written rule to be a [[technical standard|standard]] for working. If the method is written down and given to the workers they can learn it and apply it in their work area. The third principle is that according to needs, chose the best workers that have the abilities and that can be trained to follow the standard rules. When a worker has the knowledge he can do his tasks better and achieve the goals asked. Fourth principle is to create a common goal between the workers and make a [[Reward system|pay system]] to reward the ones above the common goal. With this principle the employees would work with more efficiency and do it with auto satisfaction. From these principles we deduce that every place in the enterprise costs money, so it is necessary to complete the labor analysis technique.
&lt;ref name="Introducción a la Administración"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hernandez y Rodriguez |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |title=Introducción a la Administración |trans-title=Management Introduction |url= |accessdate= |volume=1 |date=September 1994|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=México |language= Spanish |isbn= |pages= 67–70 |trans-chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Frederick Taylor's original technique is still used, other methods' variations have been developed from it. These methods are also effective.  Each one has a different process, but the main goal is to get the [[Goal|objective]]s. By knowing the different types of methods, people can use it as a strategic plan that will give an extra value against the competition.

==Derivatives of Taylor's original method==

===Labor Analysis===
The labor analysis came from the prior techniques of Frederick Taylor.The main difference is that this technique is focus on how a [[Job description|job position]] is developed in order to work with precise instructions. This diagnostic implies the actions to direct and correct the enterprise that is guided. As [[Management|managers]], they should identify and understand their workers to improve their abilities inside the enterprise. For a better knowledge of the problem the worker should know the main reason of his position and how to develop it in the company. The manager should establish each role of the company. In this way the relationship between the workers is promoted. The elements of the labor analysis are: First is the definition of position. In this step is named the actual position where is [[Hierarchical organization|located in the enterprise]]. Who are the immediate bosses? Is another boss in the area? Are there any external people working? Second step is the general description that consists in five words describe the work done in the position. Third step is specific description. In this part the obligations and their daily activities are described. Sometimes the eventual and periodical activities need to be specified. The fourth step are objectives. The main objectives need to be quantified. An objective should follow the next conditions: An [[infinitive verb]] plus a percentage of main goals, with a specific date and the operations costs.&lt;ref name="Las Arte de la Alta Dirección"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mendez|first1=Juan Nieto|editor1-first=  |editor1-last= |title= Las Artes de la Alta Dirección|trans-title=The art of High Management |url= |volume=1 |date=March 1974 |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=México |language=Spanish |isbn= |pages= 94–105|trans-chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard Method and the Harvard Case Method===
This method was developed by the [[Harvard Business School]] were is used in the Management Business Academy course based on the Frederick Taylor principles. The case presented is longer than the [[MIT]] method, but also presents the important facts of the problem like the Short Facts Method that is more simple. It is considered a classic method because it is the most used by enterprises. The enterprises use this method by creating their own case with the information of their company so every employee can understand the problems that the company has so everyone can help to find the solutions. That is why enterprises need to create the conditions needed for automotivation in order to have better results from their employees. The Harvard Business School students use this case in order to understand the problems that they can find outside the school in their real job, so they read and analyze different cases to be prepared in the business world. Each student need to take the initiative to search for more information that can be helpful to do the analysis. It has been proven that this method help the students to learn with auto[[motivation]].&lt;ref name="The HBS Case Method in Action"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academics/casemethod.html|title= The HBS Case in Action|author=Eagan L. |month= |year=1997 |publisher= |location= |trans-title=|accessdate=October 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harvard Case Method consist in four steps in which is apply the information the case present. The first step is fact analysis where the employees and managers that are analyzing the case writes the facts presented on the case without [[opinion]]s. The second step is problem [[Diagnosis|diagostic]] in which is described the problems that are presented on the case starting with the most important to solve. The third step is analysis of possible solutions where the possibility of each solution is seen as the way that can if it really can help to solve the problem. Finally, the fourth step consists in choosing one of the options presented on the step three that best solves the case. This method promote the search of answers inside the person not on the external facts. The main reason is that there is no solution or correct answers so there is an opportunity to learn from others.With the exposure of possible solutions in group you can learn with and from all the group, that is why it is effective, because the [[Observational learning|social learning]] effect.
&lt;ref name="El Método del Caso en el Estudio de Negocios:La Realidad Sin Salir del aula"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gestiopolis.com/canales2/rrhh/1/metcasos.html |title=El Metodo del Caso en el Estudio de Negocios |author= Stake, R.E. |month= |year=2008 |publisher=Gestiopolis |location= |language=Spanish |trans-title=The case method applied in the business studies  |accessdate=October 15, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short Facts Method===
This method is mostly applied by managers and [[supervisor]]s based on Frederick Taylor method. The short facts method begins with a case no longer than four [[paragraph]]s in which a simple problem is described. Later on, the case is analyzed by the group of employees and managers of the enterprise. Then after finding the main facts, the group starts a discussion to find the possible solutions. At the end with a brainstorm they choose the best solution that can be apply to their own company. The main reason to use this method is because with the case based on the company all the employees and managers can have more ideas to find a solution to the problem that is reflected on the case and the employees can learn more about how to change their own company.&lt;ref name="Administración Contemporanea"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1= Gareth|editor1-first= |editor1-last= |title=Administración Contemporanea |trans-title=Contemporary Management |accessdate=  |volume=6 |year=2010 |month= |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=México |language=Spanish |isbn= |pages= 236–240 |chapter=[Taking decisions learning, creativity, and entrepreneur spirit]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MIT Method===
The [[MIT]] method is influenced by the [[Harvard]] Method but improved for the engineers to apply it in the enterprise is also another option for [[engineer]]s to diagnose their enterprise without needing a [[Financial advisor|business advisor]]. The engineers who might be on the group need an individual reading and research about the case given after the group session. Also for the session, they need to already do an analysis and a possible solution to compare it with the group. On each session the engineers will be guided by an instructor. All the engineers ask questions to the instructor to have more information about the case solution. At the end before the session is over the instructor tell the group what solution was near the correct answer and finally he gives the correct solution. In some cases the group decides what is the best solution according to all the proposals given in the session. Even though this method need more preparation, it is a good opportunity to improve the engineers' individual abilities.&lt;ref name="Administración Contemporanea"/&gt;

===System Analysis Method===
The [[strategic]] analysis method is based on the elements or subsystems. This technique is based on prior methods of Frederick Taylor. These [[subsystem]]s are related to the entire enterprise plan, so if one is changed in modification all the enterprise. This method is divided in four steps.&lt;ref name="Estrategia Empresarial"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joseacontreras.net/admon/Administracion/Estrategia_Empresarial.html |title=Estrategia Empresarial |author= Contreras J. |month= |year=2010 |publisher= |location= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Enterprise Strategy |accessdate=October 15, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; First step is the [[Mission statement|mission]] determination in which the managers decide what they want as an enterprise, to be accomplished, what is the main purpose of the company. In this step is also include the principles that will guide the enterprise. The second step is environmental assessment. It is divided in external, determining threats and opportunities, and internal, determining strengths and weaknesses. The third step is objective setting where you create specific goals to the enterprise that can be measurable, achievable, time specific and documented. Finally the fourth step is strategy setting is when the managers create a strategy plan based on the steps before that creates the balance in the company.&lt;ref name= "“Management concepts, practices,and skills"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mondy |first1= Wayne |editor1-first=Jack |editor1-last= Peters |title= Management concepts, practices, and skills|trans-title=Administracion conceptos, practicas y habilidades |volume=5 |date=March 1991 |publisher= Allyn and Bacon |location= Massachusetts |pages=134–195 |chapter= [The Planning Process] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International implementations==
The above methods are primarily used in the United States. However, these methods are also applied in other countries such as Mexico and India. These countries were chosen because they are good examples of [[developed countries]] with high expectations in the future. In the case of México, there can be found more influences of the United States because they use the Harvard Case Method. What it is really interesting is that even though they applied the same method the improving impact is bigger in [[México]] than in the [[United States]]. While in [[India]] being the youngest country in the world brings a good opportunity to understand their business and how to enter from other parts of the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Mexico===
For [[Mexico]], the method used to diagnostic an enterprise is the case method. This method allows each person in the group to give ideas and possible solutions to the problem established. In Mexico people tend to be afraid of business and they need everyone’s opinion before they feel secure and close a business. But each participant gives his conclusions according to the knowledge he has and the experiences. In this method [[teamwork]] is very important. Everyone should collaborate in the conclusion and bring new ideas, even if they are out of this world. For PYMES, the government has created a web page in which the owners can search for useful information about small businesses.&lt;ref name="Herramientas de Gestión: Diagnostico Empresarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inta.gov.ar/altovalle/info/biblo/rompecabezas/pdfs/fyd52_col-ec.pdf|title=Herramientas de Gestión: Diagnostico Empresarial|author=Sergio Romagnioli|month=|year=2007|publisher=Fruticultura &amp; Diversión|location=|language=Spanish|trans-title=Gestion Tools: Enterprise Diagnostic|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India is a [[developing country]] has been growing in the business part. India exports increased from $13,586 million [[US dollars]] in August 2009, to $16,644 million US dollars in August 2010. [[Small and medium enterprises]] (SME) had become one of the strongest points in the economy.  The SME is an alternative for the entrepreneur people that have the management abilities and an entrepreneur vision. People following these ideas are creating small enterprises that satisfy a necessity between the [[consumer]]s and that they are capable of filling. When this enterprises have problems they could use the same method showed here to diagnose the problem and solve it.&lt;ref name="Department of Commerce Government of India"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commerce.nic.in/tradestats/indiatrade_press.asp|title=Press Release on India's Foreign Trade: August - 2010|author=|date=August 2010|publisher=Department of Commerce Government of India|trans-title=Press Release on India's foreign Trade|accessdate=October 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922090944/http://commerce.nic.in/tradestats/indiatrade_press.asp#|archive-date=2010-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using cases and using the management skills we could develop more skills for helping enterprises. For example, in India, two [[graduate student]]s began their SME with an [[Information technology|IT]] program in 1998. They started as consultants and then developed their IT enterprise as a [[Dot-com company|web product company]]. Their strategy was to build a global internet business that could allow people to buy services rather than physical products.  By this time the internet was not as common as it is right not. It was [[monopoly|monopolized]] by BSNL, but they were not stopped by the government because soon after it broke down. Without any assessment or business diagnostic enterprise method they would not continue in the market.&lt;ref name="Flying High"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entrepreneurindia.in/flying-high/3856 |title=Flying High |author=Shonali Advani |date=May 2010 |publisher=Entrepreneur Magazine |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101095901/http://entrepreneurindia.in/flying-high/3856# |archive-date=2010-11-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic analysis typically focuses on two views of organization: the industry-view and the [[resource-based view]] (RBV). These views analyse the organisation without taking into consideration relationship between the organizations strategic choice (i.e. [[Porter generic strategies]]) and institutional frameworks.'' The National Diamond''' is a tool for analyzing the organization's task environment. The National Diamond highlights that strategic choices should not only be a function of industry structure and a firm's resources, it should also be a function of the constraints of the institutional framework. Institutional analysis (such as the National Diamond) becomes increasingly important as firms enter new operating environments and operate within new institutional frameworks.

'''[[Michael Porter]]'s National Diamond''' framework resulted from a study of patterns of [[comparative advantage]] among industrialized nations. It works to integrate much of Porter's previous work in his competitive [[five forces]] theory, his [[value chain]] framework as well as his theory of [[competitive advantage]] into a consolidated framework that looks at the sources of competitive advantage sourcable from the national context. It can be used both to analyze a firm's ability to function in a national market, as well as analyse a national market's ability to compete in an international market.

It recognizes four pillars of research (factor conditions, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, firm structure, strategy and rivalry) that one must undertake in analysing the viability of a nation competing in a particular international market, but it also can be used as a comparative analysis tool in recognising which country a particular firm is suited to expanding into.

Two of the aforementioned pillars focus on the (national) [[macroeconomics]] environment to determine if the demand is present along with the factors needed for production (i.e. both extreme ends of the [[value chain]]). Another pillar focuses on the specific relationships supporting industries have with the particular firm/nation/industry being studied. The last pillar it looks at the firm's strategic response ([[microeconomics]]) i.e. its strategy, taking into account the industry structure and rivalry (see [[five forces]]). In this way it tries to highlight areas of competitive advantage as well as competitive weakness, by looking at a companies/nations suitability to the particular conditions of a particular market.

[[Image:TE-Systems-Porter's Diamond.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A graphical representation of Porter's National Diamond]]

==Components==

The six different components of the framework are:
* Factor endowment
* Related and supporting industries
* Demand conditions
* Strategy, structure, and rivalry
* Government
* Chance
===Factor conditions (endowments)===
Factor endowment can be categorized into two forms:
* "Home-grown" resources/highly specialized resources
* Natural endowments

For example, in analyzing Hollywood's preeminence in film production, Porter has pointed out the local concentration of skilled labor, including the different schools of film ([[UCLA]] &amp; [[University of Southern California|USC]]) in the area. Also, resource constraints may encourage development of substitute capabilities; Japan's relative lack of raw materials has spurred miniaturization and [[Zero Defects|zero-defect]] manufacturing.

===Related and supporting industries===
For many firms, the presence of related and supporting industries is of critical importance to the growth of that particular industry. A critical concept here is that national competitive strengths tend to be associated with "clusters" of industries. For example, [[Silicon Valley]] in the USA and [[Silicon Glen]] in the UK are [[techno cluster]]s of high-technology industries which includes individual computer software and semi-conductor firms. In Germany, a similar cluster exists around chemicals, synthetic dyes, textiles and textile machinery.

===Demand conditions===
Demand conditions in the [[domestic market]] provide the primary driver of growth, innovation and quality improvement. The premise is that a strong domestic market stimulates the firm from being a startup to a slightly expanded and bigger organization. As an illustration, we can take the case of Germany which has some of the world's premier automobile companies like [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[BMW]], [[Porsche]]. German auto companies have dominated the world when it comes to the high-performance segment of the world automobile industry. However, their position in the market of cheaper, mass-produced autos is much weaker. This can be linked to a domestic market which has traditionally demanded a high level of engineering performance. Also, the transport infrastructure of Germany, with its [[Autobahns]] does tend to favor high-performance automobiles.

===Strategy, structure and rivalry===
National performance in particular sectors is inevitably related to the strategies and the structure of the firms in that sector. Competition plays a big role in driving innovation and the subsequent upgradation of [[competitive advantage]]. Since domestic competition is more direct and impacts earlier than steps taken by foreign competitors, the stimulus provided by them is higher in terms of innovation and efficiency. As an example, the [[Japanese automobile industry]] with 8 major competitors ([[Honda]], [[Toyota]], [[Suzuki]], [[Isuzu]], [[Nissan]], [[Mazda]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Subaru]]) provide intense competition in the domestic market, as well as the foreign markets in which they compete.

===The role of government===
The role of government in Porter's Diamond Model is "acting as a catalyst and challenger; it is to encourage - or even push - companies to raise their aspirations and move to higher levels of competitive performance …" . They must encourage companies to raise their performance, stimulate early demand for advanced products, focus on specialized factor creation and to stimulate local rivalry by limiting direct cooperation and enforcing anti-trust regulations.

===Chance===
The role of chance basically denotes the idea that it may occur that many times a product or an enterprise may get an opportunity to maximize its benefits out of sheer luck. Thus chance if received plays a key role in determining the fate of the product as well.

==Criticism==
Criticism on Porter's national diamond model revolve around a number of assumptions that underlie it. As described by Davies and Ellis: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; "sustained prosperity may be achieved without a nation becoming 'innovation-driven', strong 'diamonds' are not in place in the home bases of many internationally successful industries and inward foreign direct investment does not indicate a lack of 'competitiveness' or low national productivity". &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Porter generalized from the North American, European and Japanese experiences; for countries developing in the presence of these now developed regions of the world, the model may need to be re-examined.

A '''director''' is a person from a group of managers who leads or supervises a particular area of a company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/director.html|title=What is director? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[corporation|Companies]] that use this term often have many directors spread throughout different business functions or roles (e.g. director of [[human resources]]).&lt;ref name="about.com Human Resources"&gt;{{cite web |author=Heathfield, Susan M |url=http://humanresources.about.com/od/jobdescriptions/a/HR_Director.htm |title=Sample Human Resources Director Job Description |publisher=about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director usually reports directly to a [[vice president]] or to the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] directly in order to let them know the progress of the organization. Large organizations also sometimes have assistant directors or deputy directors. ''Director'' commonly refers to the lowest level of executive in an organization, but many large companies use the title of ''associate director'' more frequently. Some companies also have regional directors and area directors. Regional directors are present in companies that are organized by location and have their departments under that. They are responsible for the operations for their particular country. Though directors are the first stage in the executive team, area directors are seen as higher up, based on their area of control.

==Corporate titles==
{{Main|Corporate title}}
Corporate titles (commonly known as business titles) are titles given to individuals within a business depending on the role they have and which also portray the duties and responsibilities within that specific role. The larger the business, the more titles that are present, such as CEO, COO and executive directors.

Those that have higher roles within a company such as the elite positions are often referred to as "chief" and those that have lower roles within the company are employees that simply carry out day-to-day tasks. There are many titles within a company such as executive director, managing director, company director and chairman.

The corporate structure consists of four key areas:
* Board of directors- oversees a department and maintains full operational responsibilities area is next to the C-level executives in the corporate jobs hierarchy. They oversee daily tasks of the business or the company.
* Employees- This role is ranked at the bottom of the structure. Employees work on daily tasks and objectives either in a group or individually aiming for that common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hierarchystructure.com/corporate-jobs-hierarchy/|title = Corporate titles|date = 2014-10-22| accessdate = 2014-10-22|website = Corporate jobs hierarchy|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structuring a board of directors ==
Depending upon the size of an organization or a company, the number of directors can vary. Start-up companies can have a single director, which is the minimum for a private limited company according to the law. However, as organizations and businesses expand, the number of directors can increase because more tasks and responsibilities become present. For example, if the company expands and has more than one department, such as finance, sales, marketing, production and IT, then the business may form a board of directors, with each director overseeing a department and maintaining full responsibility within that department.

A board of directors ensures that a clearly outlined structure is in place which will help the business to work much more efficiently.

Larger businesses and organizations will form a clear board structure as the following:

'''Chairman''' - This particular role within the company is often a non executive role that also has the task of overseeing the entire business or organization.

'''Managing Director''' - A managing director is employed by the business, often by the chairman. Other roles include running the business and producing salaries. The managing director manages the board of directors and oversees the performance of the business, thus reporting back to the chairman.

'''Executive Directors''' -  A group of executive directors who each play a significant role within the company. They maintain full responsibility over their respective departments such as Finance, Marketing and Sales. Each director manages their department ensuring that tasks and objectives are being met. Executive directors also sit on the board.

'''Non-executive directors''' -  These advise the business by proposing different forms of strategy and also decide remuneration of the executive directors.

Having a clear structure within the business has a positive impact on the employees and it also helps to organize the business. By having a team of executive directors, employees can report to their executive directors if a problem or an issue occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/structuring-board-directors|title = Structuring a board of directors|date = 2014-10-22|accessdate = 2014-10-22|website = https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/structuring-board-directors|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disagree and commit''' is a management principle which states that individuals are allowed to disagree while a decision is being made, but that once a decision has been made, everybody must commit to it. The principle can also be understood as a statement about ''when'' it is useful to have conflict and disagreement, with the principle saying disagreement is useful in early states of [[decision-making]] while harmful after a decision has been made.&lt;ref name="Origbo"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://seekingmastery.wordpress.com/2017/05/29/make-disagree-and-commit-work-for-you/ | title = Make "Disagree and Commit" Work for You | website = Seeking Mastery | publisher = WordPress.com | first = Efesa | last = Origbo | date = May 29, 2017 | accessdate = July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagree and commit is a method of avoiding the consensus trap, in which the lack of consensus leads to inaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://encyclopedia.uia.org/en/problem/140262 | title = Consensus trap {{!}} World Problems &amp; Global Issues | publisher = ''[[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential|The Encyclopedia of World Problems]]'' | accessdate = July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cj9s1QihGPIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business | first = Patrick | last = Lencioni | date = March 14, 2012 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | quote = Great teams avoid the consensus trap by embracing a concept that Intel, the legendary microchip manufacturer, calls "disagree and commit." Basically they believe that even when people can't come to an agreement around an issue, they must still leave the room umambiguously committed to a common course of action.| isbn = 9781118266106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Scott McNealy]] used the phrase as early as sometime between 1983 and 1991, as part of the line "Agree and commit, disagree and commit, or get out of the way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rQl4169IA4kC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=disagree%20and%20commit%20scott%20mcnealy&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=disagree%20and%20commit%20scott%20mcnealy&amp;f=false | title = High Noon: The Inside Story of Scott McNealy and the Rise of Sun Microsystems | first = Karen | last = Southwick | year = 1999 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.| isbn = 9780471297130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="Origbo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ecorner.stanford.edu/1642.ect | title = Agree and Commit, Disagree and Commit | first = Greg | last = Ballard | date = November 15, 2006 | publisher = Stanford eCorner | quote = This is a phrase, agree and commit, disagree and commit, that actually comes from Scott McNealy. At least that's where I was told it was from.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been attributed to [[Andrew Grove]] at [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.inc.com/magazine/201412/patrick-lencioni/innovation-wont-get-you-very-far.html | title = Why Great Leadership Fuels Innovation | date = November 20, 2014 | publisher = Inc.com | first = Patrick | last = Lencioni | accessdate = July 2, 2017 | quote = At Intel, Grove demanded not only that his people argue well, but also that they leave those argument-rich meetings fully committed to the decisions that had been made. His famous axiom "disagree and commit" captures an essential truth: Failure to capitalize on a new idea often has far less to do with the quality of the idea than with the indecision and waffling that accompany it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AdqIP5GN4GQC&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;vq=disagree%20and%20commit&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Absolute Honesty: Building a Corporate Culture that values Straight Talk and Rewards Integrity |first1=Larry |last1=Johnson |first2=Bob |last2=Phillips | year = 2003 | publisher = AMACOM| isbn = 9780814407813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/monika-szamko/what-the-paranoid-got-rig_b_9612326.html | title = What the Paranoid Got Right – The Unlikely Legacy of Andy Grove's Intel | publisher = [[The Huffington Post]] | first = Monika | last = Szamko | date = April 5, 2016 | accessdate = July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] added "Have a Backbone; Disagree and Commit" as one of its leadership principles sometime in 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011 | title = Amazon.com: Amazon Values | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522092317/http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011 | archivedate = 2011-05-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon CEO [[Jeff Bezos]] mentioned the term in his "2016 Letter to Shareholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z6o9g6sysxur57t | title = About Amazon - 2016 Letter to Shareholders | accessdate = July 2, 2017 | date = April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Noted difficulties of applying "disagree and commit" are:&lt;ref name="Origbo" /&gt;

* It can be difficult to disagree with more powerful or senior individuals
* There can be [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonance]] in committing to something while being unconvinced of it

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2363">A '''distribution deal''' (aka '''distribution contract''' or '''distribution agreement''') is a legal agreement between one party and another, to handle [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of a product.

There are various forms of distribution deals.  There are exclusive and non-exclusive distribution agreements.  In an exclusive distribution agreement, there is only one distributor or distribution agent.  The distributor is excluded from having any other distributors.  Thus the product supplier is limited to the performance of that distributor.  If the distributor does not sell product, then no project will be sold.  Thus the law implies some degree of effort into these distribution agreements.  Thus regardless what the distribution agreement says, the law will find it is breached if the distributor does not actually try to distribute the products.  Likewise distribution agreements should have explicit terms on point.  This problem arises when distributors distribute several products and/or have other businesses.  

In a non-exclusive distribution agreement, the supplier may use other distributors, mitigating the above concern.  However, at the other end of the spectrum, the supplier may have several distributors, and this may amount to a glut of them in the market, such that distributors have difficulty due to fierce competition on price and terms.

Distribution agreements are frequently broken up in terms of countries, such that a set of supply companies in one market/country, possibly supply companies in related fields like sports equipment, share a distribution agent in another market/country.  This keeps costs down, allowing the distributor to use economies of scale.

Another issue that arises is when either the quality of the supplier or distributor substantially deteriorate.  If the counterpart supplier/distributor is excessively tied to them, they may suffer as the supplier/distributor's quality/service deteriorates.  All of this should be considered when entering distribution deals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">A '''duvet day''' is a formal allowance of time off given by some employers, most commonly in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/1099138.stm |title=E-CYCLOPEDIA &amp;#124; Duvet days: A snooze button for life |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-01-03 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordspy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul McFedries |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/duvetday.asp |title=duvet day |publisher=Word Spy |date=2001-06-25 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from holiday allowance in that no prior notice is needed. Employees receive an allocation of days where if they do not want to go to work for any reason they can use a duvet day. The name is a reference to [[duvet|the item of bedding]].

Duvet days were originally given to employees by UK company August One Communications in 1997,&lt;ref name="wordspy"/&gt; and the idea has grown in popularity as some companies aim to address the changing work-life climate where people work longer hours. It can be stipulated formally in a [[contract of employment]] and is considered part of the remunerations package along with [[holiday]] allowance. The term has also since become used by people to reference taking a day off work for no normally accepted reason (such as mild sickness, grievance or holiday) even if they have no official duvet day entitlement with their employer.

In the Indian subcontinent, this is historically called a '''casual leave'''.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Employees usually are sanctioned a fixed number of days off (usually 12 per year for government and 8-12 for private employees). These days can be taken with or without planning. Since these leave days could not be accumulated or carried over into the next year, they would expire at the year end. This created a tendency to utilize all the left over casual leave in November and December. The Indian casual leave has been around for more than 50 years.

==Definition: emotional labor versus emotion work==
[[File:Waitress2k7.jpg|thumb|A [[waitress]] at a restaurant is expected to do emotional labor, such as smiling and expressing positive emotion towards customers]]

The [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]] provides the first definition of emotional labor, which is a form of emotion regulation that creates a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; The related term [[emotion work]] (also called "emotion management") refers to "these same acts done in a private context", such as within the private sphere of one's home or interactions with [[family]] and [[friendship|friends]]. Hochschild identified three emotion regulation strategies: [[cognitive]], bodily, and expressive.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title=Emotion work, feeling rules, and social structure |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=551–575 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |jstor=2778583 |date=November 1979 |ref=harv |doi=10.1086/227049}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within cognitive emotion work, one attempts to change images, ideas, or thoughts in hopes of changing the feelings associated with them.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may associate a family picture with feeling happy and think about said picture whenever attempting to feel happy. Within bodily emotion work, one attempts to change physical symptoms in order to create a desired [[emotion]].&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt deep breathing in order to reduce anger. Within expressive emotion work, one attempts to change expressive gestures to change inner feelings.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt to smile when trying to feel happy. One becomes aware of emotion work most often when one's feelings do not fit the situation. For instance, when one does not feel sad at a funeral, one becomes acutely aware of the feelings appropriate for that situation.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt;

While emotion work happens within the private sphere, emotional labor is emotion management within the workplace according to employer expectations. According to Hochschild (1983), the emotion management by employers creates a situation in which this emotion management can be exchanged in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; According to Hochschild (1983), [[Job (role)|jobs]] involving emotional labor are defined as those that:

# require face-to-face or voice-to-voice contact with the public.
# require the worker to produce an emotional state in another person.
# allow the employer, through training and supervision, to exercise a degree of control over the emotional activities of employees.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

Hochschild (1983) argues that within this [[commodification]] process, service workers are estranged from their own feelings in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

==Determinants==
# Societal, occupational, and organizational [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. For example, [[empirical]] evidence indicates that in typically "busy" stores there is more legitimacy to express negative emotions, than there is in typically "slow" stores, in which employees are expected to behave accordingly to the display rules;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rafaeli |first1=A. |last2=Sutton |first2=R.

# Supervisory regulation of display rules; That is, supervisors are likely to be important definers of display rules at the job level, given their direct influence on worker's beliefs about high-performance expectations. Moreover, supervisors' impressions of the need to suppress negative emotions on the job influence the employees' impressions of that display rule.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"/&gt;

== Surface and deep acting ==
Original description of this emotion management process, researchers have focused on surface acting and deep acting as the primary strategies that employees use to regulate their emotions. Surface acting involves a "faking" process through which outward expressions are altered, yet internal feelings are left intact (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=The managed heart: The commercialization of feeling |last=Hochschild |first=A.R. |date=1983 |journal=University of California Press |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, deep acting is an effortful process through which employees change their internal feelings to align with organizational expectations, producing more natural and genuine emotional displays (Grandey et al., 2013)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse Perspectives on Emotion Regulation at Work |last=Grandy |first=A. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn= |location= |pages=3–17 |last2=Diefendorff |first2=J.M. |last3=Rupp |first3=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3). Although the underlying regulatory processes involved in each approach differ, the objective of both, is typically to show positive emotions, which are presumed to impact the feelings of customers and bottom-line outcomes (e.g., sales, positive recommendations, and repeat business; Pugh, 2001; Tsai, 2001).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, S.

==Careers==
[[File:Altenpflegerin D1824.jpg|thumb|A [[nurse]] working in a hospital, is expected to express positive emotions towards patients, such as warmth and compassion.]]

In the past, emotional labor demands and display rules were viewed as a characteristic of particular [[wikt:occupation|occupations]], such as [[waiting staff|restaurant workers]], [[cashier]]s, [[hospital]] workers, bill collectors, [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselors]], [[secretary|secretaries]], and nurses. However, display rules have been conceptualized not only as [[role]] requirements of particular occupational groups, but also as [[interpersonal]] job demands, which are shared by many kinds of occupations.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diefendorff |first1=J. M. |last2=Richard |first2=E. M. |year=2003 |title=Antecedents and consequences of emotional display rule perceptions |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.284 |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=284–294 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.284 |pmid=12731712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bill collectors ===
In 1991, Sutton did an in-depth [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] study into bill collectors at a [[collection agency]].&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert I. |last=Sutton |year=1991 |title=Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors |journal=[[Administrative Science Quarterly]] |issue=2 |volume=36 |pages=245–268 |jstor=2393355 |doi=10.2307/2393355 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2393355}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that unlike the other jobs described here where employees need to act cheerful and concerned, bill collectors are selected and [[socialized]] to show irritation to most [[debtor]]s.  Specifically, the collection agency hired agents who seemed to be easily aroused. The newly hired agents were then trained on when and how to show varying emotions to different types of debtors.  As they worked at the collection agency, they were closely monitored by their supervisors to make sure that they frequently conveyed urgency to debtors.

Bill collectors' emotional labor consists of not letting angry and hostile debtors make them angry and to not feel guilty about pressuring friendly debtors for money.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They coped with angry debtors by publicly showing their anger or making jokes when they got off the phone.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They minimized the guilt they felt by staying emotionally detached from the debtors.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt;

=== Food-industry workers ===

====Wait staff====
[[File:Waitress taking an order.jpg|thumb|A waitress taking an order in an American restaurant]]

In her 1991 study of [[waitresses]] in [[Philadelphia]], Paules examines how these workers assert control and protect their [[self identity]] during interactions with [[customers]]. In [[restaurant]] work, Paules argues, workers' subordination to customers is reinforced through "[[cultural]] symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about [[service sector|service work]]." Because the waitresses were not strictly regulated by their [[employers]], waitresses' interactions with customers were controlled by the waitresses themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the [[stereotypes]] and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, the waitresses studied were not negatively affected by their interactions with customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill that could be used to gain control over customers. Thus, the Philadelphia waitresses took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paules|first=G.F.|title=Dishing it out: power and resistance among waitresses in a New Jersey restaurant|year=1991|publisher=Temple University|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780877228875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Paules highlights the positive consequences of emotional labor for a specific population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of [[participant observation]] research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that [[casino]] waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bayard De Volo |first=L |title=Service and surveillance: infrapolitics at work among casino cocktail waitresses |journal=[[Social Politics|Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State &amp; Society]] |year=2003 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=346–376 |doi=10.1093/sp/jxg019 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sp/jxg019 }} [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/social_politics/v010/10.3de_volo.html Article at Project MUSE.]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping system]], both casino owners and customers control waitresses' [[behavior]] and [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management makes it difficult to change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress" /&gt;

====Fast-food employees====
By using participant observation and [[interview]]s, Leidner (1993) examines how employers in fast food restaurants regulate workers' interactions with customers.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leidner|first=Robin|title=Fast food, fast talk: service work and the routinization of everyday life|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520085008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leidner (1993), employers attempt to regulate workers' interactions with customers only under certain conditions. Specifically, when employers attempt to regulate worker-customer interactions, employers believe that "the quality of the interaction is important to the success of the enterprise", that workers are "unable or unwilling to conduct the interactions appropriately on their own", and that the "tasks themselves are not too complex or context-dependent."&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), regulating employee interactions with customers involves standardizing workers' personal interactions with customers. At the [[McDonald's]] fast food restaurants in Leidner's (1993) study, these interactions are strictly scripted, and workers' compliance with the scripts and regulations are closely monitored.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

Along with examining employers' attempts to regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' respond to these regulations.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage in some form of emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a [[smile]] and friendly attitude independent of their own [[mood (psychology)|mood]] or [[temperament]] at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used [[humor]] or [[exaggeration]] to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

===Physicians===
According to Larson and Yao (2005), [[empathy]] should characterize physicians' interactions with their patients because, despite advancement in medical [[technology]], the interpersonal relationship between [[physicians]] and [[patients]] remains essential to quality [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name=Physicians&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larson |first1=E.B. |last2=Yao |first2=X. |title=Clinical empathy as emotional labor in the patient-physician relationship |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|The Journal of the American Medical Association]] |year=2005 |volume=293 |issue=9 |pages=1100–1106 |pmid=15741532 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.9.1100 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.293.9.1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians consider empathy a form of emotional labor. Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in emotional labor through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional [[contentment|satisfaction]] when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.&lt;ref name=Physicians /&gt;

===Police work===
According to Martin (1999), [[police]] work involves substantial amounts of emotional labor by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion in the presence of other [[officers]] and [[citizens]].&lt;ref name="Police Officers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=S.E. |title=Police force or police service? Gender and emotional labor |journal=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science#The Annals|The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |year=1999 |volume=561 |issue=1 |jstor=1049285 |doi=10.1177/000271629956100108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically [[masculine]] work that focuses on fighting [[crime]], policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much [[anger]], [[sympathy]], or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work, due to the [[sexist]] views of many police officers.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt; While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt;

===Public administration ===
Many scholars argue that the amount of emotional work required between all levels of government is greatest on the local level. It is at the level of cities and counties that the responsibility lies for day to day emergency preparedness, firefighters, law enforcement, public education, public health, and family and children's services. Citizens in a community expect the same level of satisfaction from their government, as they receive in a [[customer service]]-oriented job. This takes a considerate amount of work for both employees and employers in the field of public administration. There are two comparisons that represent emotional labor within public administration, "Rational Work versus Emotion Work", and "Emotional Labor versus Emotional Intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=6–7 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance====

When public administrators perform emotional labor, many scholars argue administrators are dealing with significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The reason for this is because they are on the front lines of the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emotional Labor and Crisis Response, Working on a Razor's Edge|last=Mastracci|first=Sharron H.|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2012|isbn=|location=Armonk, New York|pages=20–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: rational work vs. emotion work ====
According to Mary Guy, Public administration does not only focus on the business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=63 |last2=Newman |last3=Mastracci |first2=Meredith |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: vs. emotional intelligence ====
Knowing how to suppress and manage one's own feelings is known as [[emotional intelligence]], the ability to control one's emotions and to be able to do this at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=64–65 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) use the term "emotional proletariat" to describe [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service jobs]] in which "workers exercise emotional labor wherein they are required to display friendliness and [[deference]] to customers."&lt;ref name="Gender Book"&gt;{{citation |last1=Macdonald |first1=Cameron L. |last2=Sirianni |first2=Carmen |contribution=The service society and the changing experience of work |editor1-last=Macdonald |editor1-first=Cameron L. |editor2-last=Sirianni |editor2-first=Carmen |title=In working in the service society |year=1996 |pages=1–28 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-480-2 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of deference, these occupations tend to be stereotyped as female jobs, independent of the actual number of women working the job. According to Macdonald and Sirianni (1996), because deference is a characteristic demanded of all those in [[disadvantaged]] structural positions, especially women, when deference is made a job requirement, women are likely to be overrepresented in these jobs. Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) claim that "[i]n no other area of wage labor are the personal characteristics of the workers so strongly associated with the nature of the work."&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt; Thus, according to Macdonald and Sirianna (1996), although all workers employed within the service economy may have a difficult time maintaining their [[dignity]] and self-identity due to the demands of emotional labor, such an issue may be especially problematic for women workers.&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt;

Emotional labor also affects women by perpetuating [[occupational segregation]] and the [[gender wage gap]].&lt;ref name="Gender Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guy|first1=Mary Ellen|last2=Newman|first2=Meredith A.|date=|year=2004|title=Women's jobs, men's jobs: sex segregation and emotional labor|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|journal=[[Public Administration Review]]|volume=64|issue=3|pages=289–298|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job segregation, which is the systematic tendency for men and women to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap can at least be partially attributed to emotional labor. Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and [[empathy|empathizing]] are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations: "Excluded from job descriptions and performance evaluations, the work is invisible and uncompensated. Public service relies heavily on such skills, yet civil service systems, which are designed on the assumptions of a bygone era, fail to acknowledge and compensate emotional labor." According to Guy and Newman (2004), women working in positions that require emotion labour in addition to regular work are not compensated for this additional labour because of the sexist notion that the additional labour is to be expected of them by the fact of being a woman. This suggests that Guy and Newman believe a man conducting emotional labour would be compensated more than a woman would, however, if women are inproportionately hired for positions requiring emotional work, that does not immediately explain a wage gap comparable to men.

Positive affective display in service interactions, such as [[smiling]] and conveying friendliness, are positively associated with customer positive feelings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pugh |first1=S.D. |year=2001 |title=Service with a smile: emotional contagion in the service encounter |jstor=3069445 |journal=[[Academy of Management Journal]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1018–1027 |doi=10.2307/3069445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and important outcomes, such as intention to return, intention to recommend a store to others, and perception of overall service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parasuraman |first1=A. |last2=Zeithaml |first2=V.A. |last3=Berry |first3=L.L. |date=Spring 1988 |title=SERVQUAL: a multiple-item scale for measuring customer perceptions of service quality |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00224359/70 |journal=Journal of Retailing |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=12–40 }} [http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063550/http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that emotional labor may lead to employees' [[emotional exhaustion]] and [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]] over time, and may also reduce employees' [[job satisfaction]]. That is, higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related to higher levels of employees' emotional exhaustion,&lt;ref name="grandey_2005"/&gt; and lower levels of employees' job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brotheridge |first1=C. M. |last2=Grandey |first2=A. A. |year=2002 |title=Emotional labor and burnout: Comparing two perspectives of people work |work=Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume=60|publisher=Aop.psy.unibe.ch |url=http://www.aop.psy.unibe.ch/lehre/proseminar_burnout/9_23.05.07%20Brotheridge%20Grandey%202002.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1006/jvbe.2001.1815 |pages=17–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is empirical evidence that higher levels of emotional labor demands are not uniformly rewarded with higher wages. Rather, the reward is dependent on the level of general cognitive demands required by the job. That is, occupations with high cognitive demands evidence wage returns with increasing emotional labor demands; whereas occupations low in cognitive demands evidence a wage "penalty" with increasing emotional labor demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glomb |first1=T.M. |last2=Kammeyer-Mueller |first2=J. |last3=Rotundo |first3=M. |year=2004 |title=Emotional labor demands and compensating wage differentials |work=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=89 |pages=700–714 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |pmid=15327355 }} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220022147/http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping skills===
[[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] occurs in response to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use to adjust to the changes that occur in your life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/dual-diagnosis-program/News_and_Resources/How_Do_You_Cope |title=How Do You Cope |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2015 |website=ucla.edu |publisher=UCLA |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform to the best of their ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diefendorff|first=J|last2=Gosserand|first2=R|date=2003|title=Understanding the emotional labor process: A control theory perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=24|pages=945–959|doi=10.1002/job.230|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=November 20, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Parliament of Enterprises''' (EPE) is an event for European corporations, organized by [[Eurochambres]], the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry, once every two years. The first edition of the event was launched on 14 October 2008 on the occasion of Eurochambres' fiftieth anniversary.

==Concept==
The concept of the European Parliament of Enterprises originated from the consideration, that there is a democratic gap between the [[European institutions]] and the main actors of economic growth, entrepreneurs and that, consequently, European legislators do not sufficiently take into account entrepreneurs' concerns. 
On the other hand, businesses are largely unfamiliar with the role and functioning of the [[European Union]] and the significance that the institutions’ decisions can have on their activities and results.

==Participants==
751 entrepreneurs, or Members of the European Parliament of Enterprises (MEPEs), gather in the symbolic location of the [[Espace Léopold|Hemicycle]] of the [[European Parliament]]. The composition of the EPE reflects the number of Members of the European Parliament per member state.

==Aims and objectives==
The EPE aims to bring businesses and institutions face-to-face for one day so as to enhance mutual understanding. The EPE represents a unique opportunity for businesses to have a direct debate with high European representatives and to provide them with a direct bottom-up feedback on EU policy related issues.

==Votes==
During the EPE, Members of the European Parliament of Enterprises exercise their voting rights on major EU business-related issues.
The results of the votes are presented by Eurochambres to the relevant political interlocutors from all of the EU institutions as "the voice of European businesses”.
The "European Parliament of Enterprises” is organised with the active cooperation of Eurochambres' members, the national associations of [[Chamber of commerce|Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry]].

A '''facilitating payment''' is a certain type of payment to foreign officials that is not considered to be [[bribery]] according to [[legislation]]s of some states as well as in the international anti-bribery conventions, e.g., coming from the [[OECD]].

==Dangers==
For legal purposes, it is distinguished from [[bribery]], however the distinction is often blurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/business/opinion/is-facilitating-payment-a-bribe-or-not-758043 "Is 'facilitating payment' a bribe or not?"], ''Business Report'', September 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Determining whether a payment is a facilitating one may be difficult and depend on the circumstances. The value of the payment is not immediately relevant, however the greater the value, the higher are chances that it will be a [[red flag (signal)|red flag]] for law enforcement. Small unofficial payments are customary and even legal in some countries, nevertheless they may present a risk of liability according to the laws of the host country. There also exists a [[slippery slope]] danger of evolving into dubious payments.&lt;ref name=deming/&gt;

==Business ethics==
While being legal, facilitating payments are still considered to be questionable from the point of view of [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Argandoña|first1=Antonio|title=Corruption and Companies: The Use of Facilitating Payments|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=September 2005|volume=60|issue=3|pages=251–264|doi=10.1007/s10551-005-0133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailes, Robert (2006). Facilitation Payments: Culturally Acceptable or Unacceptable Corrupt? ''[[Business Ethics: A European Review]]'', 15(3), 293-298.&lt;/ref&gt; The following arguments have been made:
*[[Unfair competition]]: smaller business have fewer opportunities and less financial possibilities to "grease" foreign officials.
*sustaining questionable business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rdoger|first1=Raliigh|title=Ways to improve international business payment solutions|url=http://www.transferguru.com/blog/9-ways-improve-your-international-business-payment-solutions/|website=www.transferguru.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*dependence on irregular payments creates additional risk and hence discourages investment&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

Many companies therefore restrict or severely limit making facilitating payments in their policies, however this practice is not yet widespread. For example, {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, in [[Australia]], among the [[S&amp;P ASX 100]] only 24 companies control facilitating payments and only 15 are reported to prohibit them.&lt;ref name=walters&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/management-companies-enterprises/1188858-1.html "Just how is business done? A review of Australian business's approach to bribery and corruption"], by Julie Walters, ''Keeping Good Companies'',  July 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development==
[[OECD]] defines a payment to be a facilitating one if it is paid to government employees to speed up an administrative process where the outcome is already pre-determined.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

==By country==
===Australia===
{{As of|2006}}, the [[Australia]]n law has discrepancies as to the definition of the facilitating payment.

The Criminal Code defines a facilitating payment to be a payment which is &lt;ref name=walters/&gt;
* of a nominal value (the term is not defined in the Code)
* paid to a foreign official for the sole or predominant purpose of expediting a minor routine action, and
* documented as soon as possible.

The  [[Income Tax Assessment Act]] as amended in 1999 permit companies claim facilitation payments as deductions (before 1999 bribes were also valid deductions), but its definition does not refer to the size of the payment.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

Many Australian states override the federal legislation and define facilitating payments as illegal.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia this phrase (in English) means payment to a bureaucrat when he does off-job extra work for a private entity by helping deal with his ministry. It is generally unclear whether it has a part of corruption in it. It was generally considered legal, until economy minister [[Ulyukaev]] received 8 years jail for it. After this case, Russian bureaucrats are reported to heavily refrain from this practice.

===United Kingdom===
{{As of|2010}}, subsequent to the Bribery Act, the [[United Kingdom]] does not recognize the legality of facilitating payments and does not draw any distinction from bribes. However the OECD notes that the UK is unlikely to prosecute for minor facilitating payments in the areas where it is a common practice. The Ministry of Justice guidance, however, confirms that prosecutors will exercise discretion in determining whether to prosecute. In addition, informal guidance received from the SFO indicate that where it is considering action, it will be guided by the following six principles:
* Whether the company has a clear and issued policy.
* Whether the company has written guidance available to employees as to the procedures they must follow where a facilitation payment is requested or expected.
* Whether such procedures are really being followed (monitoring).
* Evidence that gifts are being recorded at the company.
* Proper action, collective or otherwise, to inform the appropriate authorities in countries when a breach of the policy occurs.
* The company is taking what practical steps it can to curtail such payments.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===United States===
Within the [[United States federal legislation]], a '''facilitating payment''' or '''"grease payment"''', as defined by the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) of 1977 and clarified in its 1988 amendments, is a payment to a foreign official, political party or party official for "routine governmental action", such as processing papers, issuing permits, and other actions of an official, in order to expedite performance of duties of non-discretionary nature, i.e., which they are already bound to perform. The payment is not intended to influence the outcome of the official's action, only its timing.&lt;ref name=deming&gt;Stuart H. Deming (2005)  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act And the New International Norms",   American Bar Association, {{ISBN|1-59031-326-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITG208fCRvcC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22facilitating+payment%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=aAgWUfUiD4&amp;sig=2zCEc0NNJwgL-GSgPosF0xCxJTU p.15]&lt;/ref&gt; Facilitation payments are one of the few exceptions from anti-[[bribery]] prohibitions of the law.

==Evolution of the notion==
Prior to the 1988 amendments, the exclusion of "grease payments" was via the definition of the "foreign official", which did not include persons without discretionary (decision-making) duties, e.g., ones with clerical functions. The major drawback of this approach is that often it is difficult to properly identify the scope of duties of a foreign official. The 1988 amendment eliminated this drawback by placing the emphasis on the purpose of the payment rather than on the duties of the recipient. At the same time the scope of the "routine governmental actions" in question was made sufficiently narrow and supplied with detailed examples.&lt;ref&gt;Don Zarin (1995) "Doing Business Under The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act",  Practising Law Institute {{ISBN|0-87224-087-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bv8jACUiP74C&amp;pg=PT4&amp;vq=facilitating&amp;dq=%22facilitating+payment%22&amp;sig=WLtZd_725SOmPExCTH8MP-fRvMs#PPT114,M1  $5.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9511">'''Foreign ownership''' or control of a [[business]] or [[natural resource]] in a [[country]] by individuals who are not citizens of that country or by [[company (law)|companies]] whose headquarters outside that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cambridge Business English Dictionary|date=28 Nov 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521122504|ref=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Oct 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, foreign ownership occurs when [[multinational corporation]]s, which do business in more than one country, inject long-term investments in a foreign country, usually in the form of [[foreign direct investment]] or [[procurement|acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chau|first1=Esther|last2=Wu|first2=Jayce|title=Economics HL/SL - Study Guide for the IB Diploma|date=2013|publisher=CANA Academy Limited|isbn=978-9881686824|page=166}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Oct 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

If a multinational corporation acquires at least half of a company, the multinational corporation becomes a [[holding company]], and the company receiving the foreign investment becomes a [[subsidiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/subsidiary?view=uk |title=Definition of subsidiary - Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English) |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |date= |accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, foreign ownership can occur when a domestic property is acquired by a foreign individual. An example is an Indian businessman buying a house in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Royse|first1=Roger|title=Foreign Ownership of U.S. Real Estate|url=http://www.rroyselaw.com/featured_articles_foreignownership-roger_article.html|website=rroyselaw.com|publisher=Royse Law Firm|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
According to the [[US Department of Defense]], the following factors relating to a company, the foreign interest, and the government of the foreign interest are reviewed in the aggregate in determining whether a company is under foreign ownership, control, or Influence:
*The record of economic and government espionage against US targets
*The record of enforcement and/or engagement in unauthorized technology transfer
*Type and sensitivity of the information that is accessed,
*The source, nature, and extent of the foreign ownership
*The record of compliance with pertinent US laws, regulations and contracts
*The nature of any bilateral and multilateral security and information exchange agreements that may be pertinent
*The ownership or control, in whole or in part, by a foreign government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence|url=http://www.dss.mil/isp/foci/foci_info.html|website=Defense Security Service|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
*The transfer of technology and organisational knowledge can lead to higher productivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of Technological Change on Productivity|website=Boundless|publisher=Boundless|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company in the host country can learn from multinational corporations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimsley|first1=Shawn|title=What Is Foreign Direct Investment? - Definition, Advantages &amp; Disadvantages|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/what-is-foreign-direct-investment-definition-advantages-disadvantages.html|website=Education Portal|publisher=Education Portal|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It increases employment and wages. Inward foreign direct investment has an overall positive effect in employment, as companies have more capital to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign ownership and consequences for British business|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Evidence%20briefing%20-%20foreign%20ownership_tcm8-13313.pdf|website=Economic &amp; Social Research Council|publisher=Economic &amp; Social Research Council|accessdate=2014-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213045656/http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Evidence%20briefing%20-%20foreign%20ownership_tcm8-13313.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It lowers prices and improves the quality of products. That is a result of higher productivity, which is beneficial for consumers and the company's competitiveness for exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blink|first1=Jocelyn|last2=Dorton|first2=Ian|title=IB Economics Course Book 2nd edition: Oxford IB Diploma Programme (International Baccalaureate)|date=2012-09-06|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0198390008}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-10-23--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
*Foreign ownership can increase the demand of products, leading to price increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heakal|first1=Reem|title=Economics Basics: Supply and Demand|url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp|website=Investopedia|publisher=Investopedia US|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The increase in productivity in the firms in foreign ownership can cause other domestic companies to become relatively less competitive, which reduces profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chau|first1=Esther|last2=Wu|first2=Jayce|title=Economics HL/SL - Study Guide for the IB Diploma|date=2013|publisher=CANA Academy Limited|isbn=978-9881686824|page=167}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Oct 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Multinational corporations may use their power to influence government policies, especially in underdeveloped countries. That may have an adverse impact on [[economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Impact of Direct Foreign Investment on Wages and Working Conditions|url= https://www.oecd.org/investment/mne/40848277.pdf|website=OECD|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A lowering of employment because of operational optimization or an increase by a planned expansion can occur. Wages can be reduced for new employees by new corporate policies, and an optimized employee benefits package can reduce benefits for all. 
*The demise of local economies can be caused by siphoning money from communities to global elites.

==Policies ==
===Indonesia===
The House of Representatives of [[Indonesia]] passed the plantation bill to set stricter rules on foreign ownership in the plantation sector to prioritise smaller local plantation firms. There is no specific percentage value on the limit on foreign ownership, but a 30% foreign ownership ceiling had been demanded by the House's Commission IV.

Plantation business groups as well as the Ministry of Agriculture had previously voiced criticism of the bill, expressing concern that it would negatively impact plantation firms and growers, as foreign investment might be reduced.

Even though the bill was passed to limit foreign ownership, the law encourages cooperation research and development between domestic and foreign businesses, universities and individuals.

A reduction in foreign ownership limit may reduce foreign investment, but it can help boost revenue for domestic firms and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Jarkata Post|title=New plantation law limits foreign ownership|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/09/30/new-plantation-law-limits-foreign-ownership.html|accessdate=2014-10-25|work=The Jakarta Post|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
As part of financial reforms, Qatar's emir has issued a law, allowing foreign investors to obtain up to 49% of listed Qatari companies for expansion in the stock market and to stimulate development in the financial industry.

Prior to the law, ceilings on listed Qatari firms restricted foreign ownership to 25%.

The reform aims to help attract more foreign investment in the long run. However, according to a wealth manager in the Gulf, "It's a step in the right direction, but it will have to be backed up by good performance from companies in order to attract foreign investment. Also, there should be limited impact from the law in the short term due to liquidity issues and limited numbers of shares available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bakr|first1=Amena|last2=Torchia|first2=Andrew|title=UPDATE 1-Qatar emir issues law raising foreign ownership limits for stocks|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/06/qatar-stocks-ownership-idUSL6N0QC2DO20140806|accessdate=2014-10-24|work=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|date=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
The Russian Duma has passed a law, reducing the foreign ownership ceiling for print publications and radio and television outlets from 50% to 20%; it was passed by with a vote of 430-2. The legislation forbids foreign governments, organisations, companies and individuals from founding or holding more than a 20% stake in Russian media businesses.

According to Vadim Dengin, one of the bill's authors, " the tighter limit on foreign ownership would help protect Russia from western influence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luhn|first1=Alec|title=Russia tightens limit on foreign ownership of media|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/russia-limit-foreign-ownership-media|accessdate=2014-10-25|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, publishers and editors of independent media companies in Russia argued that the new law would further reduce diversity of opinion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4065">'''GLAM''' is an [[acronym]] for "[[art museum|galleries]], [[library|libraries]], [[archive]]s, and [[museum]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Australian Society of Archivists, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030801224434/http://www.archivists.org.au/events/conf2003/ Australian Society of Archivists Annual Conference - GLAM], 17–20 September 2003, Hilton, Adelaide.[https://books.google.com/books/about/Glam.html?id=fRwMRAAACAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC Wiki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/GLAM|title=GLAM - CC Wiki|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[cultural institutions]] that have access to knowledge as their mission.

Various versions of the acronym exist, such as '''LAM''', which leaves out galleries, which may be seen as a subset of museums, and may be confused with commercial galleries where art is bought and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BibSI |url=http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |title=On the LAM: Library, Archive, and Museum Collections in the Creation and Maintenance of Knowledge Communities &amp;#124; BibSI |publisher=Bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305191920/http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |archivedate=2014-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lam.alaska.gov/ |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090501071432/http%3A//lam%2Ealaska%2Egov/ |archivedate= May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LAM DNA August 4, 2005 by Jim |url=http://hangingtogether.org/?p=15 |title=Blog Archive » LAM DNA |publisher=hangingtogether.org |date=2005-08-04 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLAMR is another variant which includes Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Conference - Australian Society of Archivists|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/2017-conference|website=www.archivists.org.au|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, GLAMs are institutions in the public interest, collecting [[cultural heritage]] materials.

The term LAM has been in use at least since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_saAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=LAM+libraries+archives+museums&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=E-LAM|title=Information Retrieval &amp; Library Automation|date=1997|publisher=Lomond Systems.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as these institutions saw their missions overlapping, creating the need for a wider industry sector grouping. This became apparent as they placed their collections online—artworks, books, documents, and artifacts all effectively becoming "information resources."

Proponents of greater collaboration argue that the present convergence is actually a return to traditional unity. These institutions share epistemological links dating from the [[Library of Alexandria|“Museum” of Alexandria]] and continuing through the [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] gathered in early modern Europe. Over time as collections expanded, they became more specialized and their housing was separated according to the form of information and kinds of users. Furthermore, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries distinct professional societies and educational programs developed for each kind of institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Archives, Libraries, Museums: Coming Back Together?|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/libraries_and_culture/v049/49.1.marcum.html|journal = Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 2166-3033|pages = 74-89|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/lac.2014.0001|first = Deanna|last = Marcum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As collecting institutions, GLAMs preserve and make accessible primary sources valuable for researchers.

{{Labour|sp=Oxford|expanded=academic}}
'''Industrial relations''' or '''employment relations''' is the multidisciplinary academic field that studies the employment relationship;{{sfnm |1a1=Ackers |1y=2002 |2a1=Kaufman |2y=2004 |2p=94}} that is, the complex interrelations between [[employer]]s and [[employee]]s, [[labor union|labor/trade union]]s, [[employer organization]]s and [[the state]]. 

The newer name, "employment relations" is increasingly taking precedence because "industrial relations" is often seen to have relatively narrow connotations.{{sfn|Lewis|Thornhill|Saunders|2003|p=3}} Nevertheless, industrial relations has frequently been concerned with employment relationships in the broadest sense, including "non-industrial" employment relationships. This is sometimes seen as paralleling a trend in the separate but related  disciple of [[human resource management]].{{sfn|Banfield|Kay|2008|p=114}}

While some scholars regard or treat industrial/employment relations as synonymous with '''employee relations''' and [[labour relations]], this is controversial, because of the narrower focus of employee/labour relations, i.e. on employees or labour, from the perspective of employers, managers and/or officials. In addition, employee relations is often perceived as dealing only with non-unionized workers, whereas labour relations is seen as dealing with [[Portal:Organized_Labour|organized labour]], i.e unionized workers.&lt;ref name="OgilvieCooper2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ogilvie |first=John R. |year=2006 |title=CLEP Principles of Management |location=Piscataway, New Jersey |publisher=Research &amp; Education Association |isbn=978-0-7386-0125-0 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=July 2018}} Some academics, universities and other institutions regard human resource management as synonymous with one or more of the above disciplines,{{sfn|Rose|2008}} although this too is controversial.

== Overview ==
Industrial relations examines various employment situations, not just ones with a unionized workforce. However, according to Bruce E. Kaufman, "To a large degree, most scholars regard [[trade union|trade unionism]], [[collective bargaining]] and labour–[[management]] relations, and the national labour policy and [[labour law]] within which they are embedded, as the core subjects of the field."{{sfn|Kaufman|2008|p=31}}

Initiated in the United States at end of the 19th century, it took off as a field in conjunction with the [[New Deal]]. However, it is generally regarded as a separate field of study only in English-speaking countries, having no direct equivalent in continental Europe.{{sfn|Ackers|2002}} In recent times, industrial relations has been in decline as a field, in correlation with the decline in importance of trade unions{{sfn|Kaufman|2008|p=31}} and also with the increasing preference of [[business school]]s for the human resource management paradigm.{{sfn|Taras|2008|p=124}}

Industrial relations has three faces: science building, problem solving, and ethical.{{sfn|Kaufman|2004|p=94}} In the science building phase, industrial relations is part of the [[social science]]s, and it seeks to understand the [[employment]] relationship and its institutions through high-quality, rigorous research. In this vein, industrial relations scholarship intersects with scholarship in [[labour economics]], [[industrial sociology]], [[labour history (discipline)|labour]] and [[social history]], [[human resource management]], [[political science]], [[law]], and other areas.

Industrial relations scholarship assumes that labour markets are not perfectly competitive and thus, in contrast to mainstream [[economic theory]], employers typically have greater bargaining power than employees. Industrial relations scholarship also assumes that there are at least some inherent conflicts of interest between employers and employees (for example, higher wages versus higher profits) and thus, in contrast to scholarship in human resource management and [[organizational behaviour]], conflict is seen as a natural part of the employment relationship. Industrial relations scholars therefore frequently study the diverse institutional arrangements that characterize and shape the employment relationship—from norms and power structures on the shop floor, to employee voice mechanisms in the workplace, to [[collective bargaining]] arrangements at company, regional, or national level, to various levels of public policy and [[labour law]] regimes,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} to varieties of [[capitalism]]{{sfn|Hamann|Kelly|2008|p=129}} (such as [[corporatism]], [[social democracy]], and [[neoliberalism]]).

When labour markets are seen as imperfect, and when the employment relationship includes conflicts of interest, then one cannot rely on markets or [[manager]]s to always serve workers' interests, and in extreme cases to prevent worker exploitation. Industrial relations scholars and practitioners, therefore, support institutional interventions to improve the workings of the employment relationship and to protect workers' rights. The nature of these institutional interventions, however, differ between two camps within industrial relations.{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008}} The pluralist camp sees the employment relationship as a mixture of shared interests and conflicts of interests{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|p=104}} that are largely limited to the employment relationship. In the workplace, pluralists, therefore, champion [[grievance (labour)|grievance]] procedures, [[employee voice]] mechanisms such as [[works council]]s and [[trade union]]s, collective bargaining, and labour–management partnerships. In the policy arena, pluralists advocate for [[minimum wage]] laws, [[occupational health and safety]] standards, [[international labour standards]], and other employment and labour laws and public policies.{{sfn|Befort|Budd|2009}} These institutional interventions are all seen as methods for balancing the employment relationship to generate not only economic efficiency but also employee equity and  voice.{{sfn|Budd|2004}} In contrast, the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-inspired critical camp sees employer–employee conflicts of interest as sharply antagonistic and deeply embedded in the socio-political-economic system. From this perspective, the pursuit of a balanced employment relationship gives too much weight to employers' interests, and instead deep-seated structural reforms are needed to change the sharply antagonistic employment relationship that is inherent within capitalism. Militant trade unions are thus frequently supported.

== History ==
Industrial relations has its roots in the [[industrial revolution]] which created the modern employment relationship by spawning free labour markets and large-scale industrial organizations with thousands of wage workers.{{sfn|Kaufman|2004|pp=15–16}} As society wrestled with these massive economic and social changes, labour problems arose. Low wages, long working hours, monotonous and dangerous work, and abusive supervisory practices led to high employee turnover, violent [[strike action|strikes]], and the threat of social instability. Intellectually, industrial relations was formed at the end of the 19th century as a middle ground between classical economics and [[Marxian economics|Marxism]],{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} with [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]'s ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (1897) being a key intellectual work.{{sfn|Farnham|2008}} Industrial relations thus rejected the classical econ.

Institutionally, industrial relations was founded by [[John R. Commons]] when he created the first academic industrial relations program at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1920.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Another scholarly pioneer in industrial relations and labour research was [[Robert F. Hoxie]].{{sfn|Kuhn|Lewin|McNulty|1983|p=157}} Early financial support for the field came from [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] who supported progressive labour–management relations in the aftermath of the [[Ludlow Massacre|bloody strike at a Rockefeller-owned coal mine in Colorado]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In Britain, another progressive industrialist, [[Montague Burton]], endowed chairs in industrial relations at the universities of [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1929–1930.{{sfn|Sigsworth|1990|p=124}}

Beginning in the early 1930s there was a rapid increase in membership of [[labor unions in the United States|trade unions in the United States]], and with that came frequent and sometimes violent labour–management conflict.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=61–62}} During the [[Second World War]] these were suppressed by the arbitration powers of the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|National War Labor Board]].{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=62}}

However, as the Second World War drew to a close and in anticipation of a renewal of labour–management conflict after the war, there was a wave of creations of new academic institutes and degree programs that sought to analyse such conflicts and the role of collective bargaining.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=61–67, 80–81}} The most known of these was the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]], founded in 1945.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=63}}&lt;ref name="nyt-1947"/&gt;  But counting various forms, there were over seventy-five others.&lt;ref name="nyt-1947"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fine |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Fine |date=9 February 1947 |title=Growth and Variety of University Programs in Labor Studies Shown in a Survey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/02/09/archives/growth-and-variety-of-university-programs-in-labor-studies-shown-in.html |url-access=subscription |newspaper=The New York Times |page=E9 |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the [[Yale Labor and Management Center]], directed by [[E. Wight Bakke]], which began in 1945.&lt;ref name="nyt-1946"&gt;{{cite news |last=Porter |first=Russell |date=15 July 1946 |title=Behavior Studied for Labor Peace |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/07/15/archives/behavior-studied-for-labor-peace-research-by-new-unit-at-yale-seeks.html |url-access=subscription |newspaper=The New York Times |page=23 |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influential industrial relations scholar in the 1940s and 1950s was [[Neil W. Chamberlain]] at [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] universities.{{sfn|Kuhn|Lewin|McNulty|1983}} 

In the 1950s, industrial relations was formalized as a distinct academic discipline with the emergence in the UK of the so-called "Oxford school", including {{ill|Allan Flanders|de}}, [[Hugh Clegg (industrial relations)|Hugh Clegg]],{{sfn|Ackers|Wilkinson|2005|p=446}} and [[Alan Fox (sociologist)|Alan Fox]], Lord [[William McCarthy, Baron McCarthy|William McCarthy]], Sir [[George Bain (academic)|George Bain]] (all of whom taught at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]]), as well as [[Otto Kahn-Freund]] ([[Brasenose College, Oxford]]).

Industrial relations was formed with a strong problem-solving orientation{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=187}} that rejected both the classical economists' ''[[laissez-faire]]'' solutions to labour problems and the Marxist solution of [[class revolution]]. It is this approach that underlies the [[New Deal]] legislation in the United States, such as the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]].

By the early 21st century, the academic field of industrial relations was often described as being in crisis.{{sfnm |1a1=Ackers |1y=2002 |2a1=Kaufman |2y=2004 |3a1=Whalen |3y=2008}} In academia, its traditional positions are threatened on one side by the dominance of mainstream economics and organizational behaviour, and on the other by [[postmodernism]]. 

In policy-making circles, the industrial relations emphasis on institutional intervention is trumped by a neoliberal emphasis on the ''laissez-faire'' promotion of [[free market]]s. In practice, trade unions are declining and fewer companies have industrial relations functions.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The number of academic programs in industrial relations is therefore shrinking, while fields such as human resource management and organizational behaviour grow.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=189, 192}} The importance of this work, however, is stronger than ever, and the lessons of industrial relations remain vital. The challenge for industrial relations is to re-establish these connections with the broader academic, policy, and business worlds.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
Industrial relations scholars such as Alan Fox have described three major theoretical perspectives or frameworks, that contrast in their understanding and analysis of workplace relations. The three views are generally known as unitarism, pluralism, and the radical or critical school. Each offers a particular perception of workplace relations and will, therefore, interpret such events as workplace conflict, the role of unions and job regulation differently. The perspective of the critical school is sometimes referred to as the ''[[conflict theories|conflict]] model'', although this is somewhat ambiguous, as pluralism also tends to see conflict as inherent in workplaces. Radical theories are strongly identified with [[Marxist theory|Marxist theories]], although they are not limited to these.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Pluralist perspective ===
In pluralism, the organization is perceived as being made up of {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=powerful and}} divergent sub-groups, each with its own legitimate interests{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} and loyalties and with their own set of objectives and leaders. In particular, the two predominant sub-groups in the pluralist perspective are the management and trade unions. The pluralist perspective also supports that conflict is inherent in dealing with industrial relations since different sub-groups have different opinions in the day-to-day operations.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Consequently, the role of management would lean less towards enforcing and controlling and more toward persuasion and coordination.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Trade unions are deemed as legitimate representatives of employees,{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} conflict is dealt by collective bargaining and is viewed not necessarily as a bad thing and, if managed, could, in fact, be channeled towards evolution and positive change. It is the opposite of the unitary approach, there are different the group within the environment. Hence, the interest of employers and employee are divergent.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The employers want to maximize profit {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=at the expenses of employees}} and employees want to enjoy social benefits in the form of increased wages,{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} conducive environment. Therefore, conflict is inevitable and the need for the trade union to protect the interest of both parties. Also, there is dual authority/loyalty in this approach. Therefore, employees are loyal to the management as well as their labour leaders.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Unitarist perspective ===
In unitarism, the organization is perceived as an integrated and harmonious whole with the idea of "one happy family" in which management and other members of the staff all share a common purpose by emphasizing mutual co-operation.{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}}&lt;!-- NOTE: This sentence appears to have been lifted by Zhang from Wikipedia rather than the other way around. --&gt; Furthermore, unitarism has a paternalistic approach: it demands loyalty of all employees{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}} and is managerial in its emphasis and application.{{sfn|Barchiesi|2014|p=243}} Consequently, trade unions are deemed as unnecessary{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|pp=92–93, 103}} since the loyalty between employees and organizations are considered mutually exclusive, and there cannot be two sides of industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Conflict is perceived as {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=destructive and}} the result of poor management.{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|p=103}}

=== Radical or critical perspective ===
This view of industrial relations looks at the nature of the capitalist society, where there is a fundamental division of interest between capital and labour, and sees workplace relations against this background. This perspective sees inequalities of power and economic wealth as having their roots in the nature of the capitalist economic system.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Conflict is therefore seen as a natural outcome of capitalism, thus it is inevitable and trade unions are a natural response of workers{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}} to their exploitation by capital. Whilst there may be periods of acquiescence, the Marxist view would be that institutions of joint regulation would enhance rather than limit management's position as they presume the continuation of capitalism rather than challenge it.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is "an authorization to use licensed material".

In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability. The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations.

A licensor may grant a '''license''' under [[intellectual property]] laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a ([[patent]]ed) invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor.&lt;ref&gt;Intellectual Property Licensing:  Forms and Analysis, by [[Richard Raysman]], Edward A. Pisacreta and Kenneth A. Adler. Law Journal Press, 1999-2008. {{ISBN|978-1-58852-086-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a '''term''', '''territory''', '''renewal''' provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor.

'''Term:''' many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement.

'''Territory:''' a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to "North America" (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan.

A shorthand definition of license is "a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee". That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Licensing Intellectual Property: Law &amp; Management, by [[Raman Mittal]]. Satyam Law International, New Delhi, India, 2011. {{ISBN|978-81-902883-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing form sub-branches of law born out of the interplay of general laws of contract and specific principles and statutory laws relating to these respective assets.

== Mass licensing of software ==

{{Main|Software license agreement}}

Mass distributed software is used by individuals on personal computers under license from the developer of that software. Such license is typically included in a more extensive end-user license agreement (EULA){{Clarify|date=January 2018|reason=Difference between license and EULA is unclear.}} entered into upon the installation of that software on a computer.
Typically, a license is associated with a unique code, that when approved grants the end user access to the software in question.

Under a typical end-user license agreement, the user may install the software on a limited number of computers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The enforceability of end-user license agreements is sometimes [[Software license agreement#Enforceability of EULAs in the United States|questioned]].

== Patent licensing ==
A licensor may grant permission to a licensee to conduct activities which would otherwise be within the licensor's [[patent]]ed exclusive rights.  Under U.S. patent law, those activities are to make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import a patented product, or to perform a patented process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/html/USCODE-2011-title35-partIII-chap28-sec271.htm|title=U.S.C. Title 35 - PATENTS|author=|date=|website=www.gpo.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term of a [[patent]] license may be a "fixed" (i.e., specified) term, such as 5 years, or may be for the life of the [[patent]] (i.e., until the [[patent]] expires).  A patent is by its nature limited in territorial scope; it only covers activity within the borders of the country issuing the patent.  Accordingly, a [[patent]] license does not require a territory provision.

The consideration provided by the licensee in return for the patent license grant is called a [[patent]] [[royalty payment]].  In a "paid-up" license, the "lump sum" royalty payment is a specified monetary amount, typically due shortly after the effective date of the patent (e.g., within 15 business days of the effective date), and no further payments are required.  Otherwise, the royalty payment is a "running royalty," typically payable on an annual basis.  The annual royalty may be a specified amount (e.g., one million dollars each year), or an amount proportional to the volume of licensed activity conducted by the licensee (e.g., one dollar per unit of licensed product sold by the licensee that year, or one percent of the net sales amount of the licensed products sold by the licensee that year).

A '''Licensing agreement''' is an arrangement whereby a licensor grants the right to intangible property to another entity for a specified period, and in return, the licensor receives a royalty fee from the licensee. Intangible property includes patents, inventions, formulas, processes, designs, copyrights, and trademarks.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W.L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2015|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811277-5|pages=455–456|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advantages of a Licensing Agreement:''' 
* A primary advantage of a licensing agreement, the firm does not have to bear the development and risks associated with opening a foreign market. It is very attractive for firms lacking the capital to develop operations overseas. Licensing can be attractive when a firm is unwilling to commit substantial financial resources to an unfamiliar or politically volatile foreign market.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt; Licensing is primarily used with a firm wants to participate in a foreign market but is prohibited because of barriers to investment.

'''Disadvantages of a Licensing Agreement'''
* First, it does not give a firm the tight control over manufacturing, marketing, and strategy that is required for realizing experience curve and location economies.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;
* Second, competing in a global market may require a firm to coordinate strategic moves across countries by using profits earned in one country to support competitive attacks in another. Licensing limits a firms ability to do this.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;
* Lastly, a third problem with licensing is the relationship of the economic theory of FDI. This is associated with licensing technological know-how foreign companies. Technological know-how constitutes the basis of many multi-national firms' competitive advantages. Most firms wish to control how their know-how is used, because they can lose control easily. Many firms make the mistake of thinking they could maintain control over their know-how within the licensing agreement.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;

== Trademark and brand licensing ==

A licensor may grant permission to a licensee to distribute products under a [[trademark]]. With such a license, the licensee may use the trademark without fear of a claim of trademark infringement by the licensor.
The assignment of a license often depends on specific [[contractual terms]]. The most common terms are, that a license is only applicable for a particular geographic region, just for a certain period of time or merely for a stage in the [[value chain]].
Moreover, there are different types of fees within the trademark and brand licensing. The first form demands a fee independent of [[sales]] and [[profit (accounting)|profits]], the second type of license fee is dependent on the productivity of the licensee.

When a licensor grants permission to a licensee to not only distribute, but manufacture a patented product, it is known as [[licensed production]].

==Artwork and character licensing==

A licensor may grant a permission to a licensee to copy and distribute [[copyright]]ed works such as "art" (e.g., [[Thomas Kinkade]]'s painting "Dawn in Los Gatos") and characters (e.g., [[Mickey Mouse]]). With such license, a licensee need not fear a claim of copyright infringement brought by the copyright owner.

[[Artistic license]] is, however, not related to the aforementioned license. It is a [[euphemism]] that denotes freedom of expression, the ability to make the subject appear more engaging or attractive, by [[fiction]]alising part of the subject.

==Academia== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ecclesiastical court]] --&gt;
:''National examples of the licentiate are listed at [[licentiate (degree)]]''

A [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] is an [[academic degree]] that traditionally conferred the license to teach at a university or to practice a particular profession. The term survived despite the fact that nowadays a [[doctorate]] is typically needed in order to teach at a university. The term is also used for a person who holds a licentiate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/licentiate?region=uk&amp;q=Licentiate Oxford Living Dictionaries] Accessed September 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/licentiate|title=Definition of LICENTIATE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English, the degree has never been called a license. In French-speaking countries, the bachelor's degree is called a ''licence''.

In [[Education in Sweden|Sweden]], [[Education in Finland|Finland]], and in some other European university systems, a 'licentiate' is a postgraduate degree between the master's degree and the doctorate.  The licentiate is a popular choice in those countries where a full [[doctorate|doctoral degree]] would take five or more years to achieve.

==Vehicle licensing==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
{{see also|Driver's license}}
A license to driving certain vehicles has been applied to many countries around the world. Being allowed to drive a certain vehicle requires a specific driving license, the type of license depending on the type of vehicle.

==Criminal law==
{{Main|Parole#United Kingdom|Temporary licence}}
In the United Kingdom prisoners may be released prior to the completion of their full sentence "on licence".  Basically, the licence is the prisoner's agreement to maintain certain conditions, such as periodic reporting in to a probation officer and maintaining fixed address, in exchange for his freedom.&lt;ref name="NOMS"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Licence conditions, licences and licence and supervision notices |date=23 March 2015 |publisher=National Offender Management Service |url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/psipso/psi-2015/psi-12-2015-licences-conditions-supervision.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70FRY3UOT?url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/psipso/psi-2015/psi-12-2015-licences-conditions-supervision.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Gianquitto |first1=Lisa |last2=Rule |first2=Philip |date=1 February 2012 |title=Licences and Licence conditions |newspaper=InsideTime |url=https://insidetime.org/licences-and-licence-conditions/ |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70FSHvnGT?url=https://insidetime.org/licences-and-licence-conditions/ |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parole]] and [[release on licence]] are the same procedure by another name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Parole and release on licence |publisher=The  Scottish Government |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/parole-release-on-licence |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617223119/http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/parole-release-on-licence |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The provision of licenses and the agencies that mandate them are often criticised by libertarians, like [[Milton Friedman]], for creating an anticompetitive environment for occupations, which creates a [[barrier to entry]] for more qualified and skilled individuals who may not have the resources to obtain the necessary licences. According to Friedman, licenses and permits have become so burdensome due to legislation that favors the current  establishment of wealthy occupants that they decrease the supply of such occupations, which raises prices for the average consumer. Libertarians and the anti-authoritarian left ([[anarcho-communists]]) view competing guilds and other voluntary communes as being more beneficial for disseminating the skills and education required to perform a specified career.

{{Business administration}}

A '''business entity''' is an entity that is formed and administered as per [[corporate law]] in order to engage in [[business]] activities, charitable work, or other activities allowable. Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many types of [[business entities]] defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include [[corporation]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[partnership]]s, [[sole trader]]s, [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]] and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:

:≈ [[Ltd.]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[public limited company]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[limited partnership]]
:≈ unlimited partnership
:≈ [[chartered company]]
:≈ [[Statutory corporation|statutory company]]
:≈ [[holding company]]
:≈ [[Subsidiary|subsidiary company]]
:≈ one man company ([[sole proprietorship]])
:≈ [[charitable incorporated organisation]] (UK)
:≈ [[non-governmental organization]]

However, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choose a legal structure for a new business |url=https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures |publisher=[[GOV.UK]] |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173536/https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures# |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. [[Unlimited liability corporation]]s can be formed in Alberta "AULC" and Nova Scotia "NSULC".

The word or expression "Limited", ''Limitée'', "Incorporated", ''Incorporée'', "Corporation" or ''Société par actions de régime fédéral'' or the corresponding abbreviation "Ltd.", ''Ltée'', "Inc.", "Corp." or ''S.A.R.F.'' forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)

As an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated ''Société commerciale canadienne'' or by the abbreviation ''S.C.C.''

Under the [[Canada Cooperatives Act]] (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word "cooperative", "co-operative", "coop", "co-op", ''coopérative'', "united" or "pool", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.

Unlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx|title=NS vs. Alberta ULCs|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723021544/http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx#|archive-date=2014-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:
*SP (Sole Proprietorship): No formal business structure is established
*GP (General Partnership): Either a formal structure with a partnership agreement, or an informal structure, in which case the Partnerships Act for the province will apply
*LP (Limited Partnership): An investment structure, limiting both the liability and the participation of the investor. An investor who takes an active role will be deemed a general partner, and become exposed to unlimited liability.
*Corporation
*Joint Venture: A business activity shared by two or more business entities. The joint venture's activities must be finite in terms of either time or scope.

There are three main forms of business:

(a) Sole Proprietorship
(b) Partnership
(c) Company

*Sole Proprietorship

In a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.

*Partnership

A partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.

Partnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.

For taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:

(i) Registered Firms
(ii) Unregistered Firms

The income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.

For unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).

*Company

A company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.

A company having share capital may be formed as:

(i) A company limited by shares.
(ii) A company limited by guarantee.
(iii) An unlimited company.

*Company Limited by Shares

The liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.

*Public Limited Companies can be formed by at least seven persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. The word 'Limited' is used as the last word of its name.
*Private Limited Companies may be formed by at least two persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. A private limited company, by its Articles of Association:

(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;
(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;
(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.

A private limited company is required to use the words "(Private) Limited" as the last words of its name.

*Company Limited By Guarantee

Means a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited" as the last words of their n
Unlimited Company

Means a company having unlimited liability of its members

==United States==
In the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.

=== Tax classifications ===
For federal tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has separate [[entity classification]] rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a [[corporation]], a [[partnership]], a [[Cooperative]] or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a [[C corporation]] or elect to be treated as a [[Subchapter S corporation]]. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified [[real estate investment trust]] subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity.&lt;ref name="Presti and Naegele Newsletter"&gt;[http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity Presti and Naegele Newsletter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173503/http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity# |date=2013-01-15 }}, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To be recognized as a [[Cooperative]] for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="IRS Sub Chapter T"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184|title=IRS Sub Chapter T|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904163915/http://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184#d0e184|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federally incorporated===
The key word for a bank is "national". A bank chartered by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) must have the word "national" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have "national" in its name.

For a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is "federal", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word "federal" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have "federal" in its name.

*FSB ([[Federal savings bank|Federal Savings Bank]]), formerly called federal savings and loan association
*NA ([[National bank#United States|National Association]]), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
*NT&amp;SA ([[National Trust and Savings Association]]), a less common designation used by national banks
*[[Credit union#United States|Federal Credit Union]], chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA)

Many federal governmental units are specially formed [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]]s, while some private organizations have received a [[Congressional charter|charter from Congress]].

===State, territory or commonwealth incorporated===
{{See also|United States corporate law}}

The following are the main business designations and types:
*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''': a business consisting of a single owner (which may in turn be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form.
*'''[[Trust (business)|Trust]]'''

====Partnerships====
*'''[[General partnership]]''': a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals.
*[[Limited partnership|LP]], '''Limited partnership''': a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. 
*[[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], '''Limited Liability Partnership''': a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships).
*[[Limited liability limited partnership|LLLP]], '''Limited Liability Limited Partnership''': a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states.

====Limited Liability Companies====
*[[Limited liability company|LLC]], LC, Ltd. Co., '''Limited Liability Company''': a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a [[corporation]]. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states ''Ltd.'' by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. [[Texas]]), it may denote a corporation instead. See also [[Series LLC]]. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship.
*[[Limited liability company#Variations|PLLC]], '''Professional Limited Liability Company''': some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits.

====Corporations====
*[[Corporation|Corp.]], [[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]], '''Corporation, Incorporated''': used to denote [[corporation]]s ([[public company|public]] or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in [[Connecticut]]; see under [[#Italy|Italy]]). Some states that allow the use of "Company" prohibit the use of "and Company", "and Co.", "&amp; Company" or "&amp; Co.". In most states [[sole proprietorship]]s and partnerships may register a fictitious "[[doing business as]]" name with the word "Company" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. 
*'''[[Professional corporation]]''', PC or P.C.: those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors.
*'''[[Doing Business As]]''': denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requirements vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices.  See also [[Delaware corporation]], [[Delaware statutory trust]], [[Nevada corporation]], and [[Massachusetts business trust]].

In [[New Zealand]] [[economics]], '''onshore and offshore services''' are respectively [[service (economics)|services]] provided within New Zealand to foreigners and services provided outside New Zealand to New Zealanders.

==Onshore services==

The best example of an onshore service is tourism. For example, if an American resident were to travel to New Zealand, and play golf with his friends in [[Auckland]], the provision of golfing facilities would be classified as an onshore service as the Auckland (New Zealand) golf club is providing the American tourist with a service.

==Offshore services==

New Zealand is heavily reliant on overseas providers for insurance services and for transport for goods via sea. For instance, if a New Zealand tourist flies [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Airlines]] from Ireland to London, this tourist has used a service, not provided by his own country, to travel from one place to another.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to commercial law:

'''[[Commercial law]]''' &amp;ndash; body of [[law]] that governs [[business]] and [[commerce|commercial]] transactions. It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]]. It is also called '''business law'''.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is commercial law? ==

Commercial law can be described as all of the following:

* Branch of [[law]] &amp;ndash; law is a [[system]] of rules and guidelines which are enforced through [[social]] [[institution]]s to govern behavior, wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90; see "[[analytical jurisprudence]]" for extensive debate on what law is; in ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' Hart argued law is a "system of rules" (Campbell, ''The Contribution of Legal Studies'', 184); Austin said law was "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction" (Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]); Dworkin describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve [[justice]] (Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410); and Raz argues law is an "authority" to mediate people's interests (Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams''''' is a 1987 book on the social side of software development, specifically managing project teams.  It was written by software consultants [[Tom DeMarco]] and [[Tim Lister]], from their experience in the world of software development.  This book was revised in 2013.

==Overview==
''Peopleware'' is a popular book about software organization management. The first chapter of the book claims, "The major problems of our work are not so much ''technological'' as ''sociological'' in nature". The book approaches sociological or 'political' problems such as group chemistry and team jelling,  "[[Flow (psychology)|flow]] time" and quiet in the work environment, and the high cost of turnover.   Other topics include the conflicts between individual work perspective and corporate ideology, corporate entropy, "teamicide" and workspace theory.

The authors presented most subjects as principles backed up by some concrete story or other information. As an example, the chapter "Spaghetti Dinner" presents a fictional example of a manager inviting a new team over for dinner, then having them buy and prepare the meal as a group, in order to produce a first team success. Other chapters use real-life stories or cite various studies to illustrate the principles being presented.

==Editions==
*1st Edition: 1987
*2nd Edition: 1999
The second edition kept the original content with only a few changes or corrections. The bulk of the new content was in a new section at the end. The new section's chapters revisited some of the concepts of the original chapters with changes and added new ones.
The eBook PDF version published by DorsetHouse was not searchable as each page appeared to be an image.  The Kindle version is searchable.
*3rd Edition: 2013
The new content of the third edition is spread out through the book. There are new chapters, but the original content has also been updated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19179">A '''business proposal''' is a written offer from a seller to a prospective buyer.
Business proposals are often a key step in the [[complex sales]] process—i.e., whenever a buyer considers more than price in a purchase.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;Newman, Larry. Shipley Associates Proposal Guide, ([http://www.shipleywins.com/myaccount-products.php Proposal Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111033643/https://www.shipleywins.com/myaccount-products.php |date=2008-11-11 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal puts the buyer's requirements in a context that favors the seller's products and services, and educates the buyer about the capabilities of the seller in satisfying their needs.&lt;ref name=Ricci&gt;Ricci, Laura; (1996–2007), The Magic of Winning Proposals (publisher R³) {{ISBN|0-9657399-1-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of proposals==
There are three distinct categories of business proposals:
* Formally solicited 
* Informally solicited
* Unsolicited

Solicited proposals are written in response to published requirements, contained in a [[request for proposal]] (RFP), [[request for quotation]] (RFQ), [[invitation for bid]] (IFB), or a [[request for information]] (RFI).

'''Request for proposal (RFP)'''

RFPs provide detailed specifications of what the customer wants to buy and sometimes include directions for preparing the proposal, as well as evaluation criteria the customer will use to evaluate offers. Customers issue RFPs when their needs cannot be met with generally available products or services. RFIs are issued to qualify the vendors who are interested in providing service/products for specific requirements. Based on the response to RFI, detailed RFP is issued to qualified vendors who the organization believes can provide desired services. Proposals in response to RFPs are seldom less than 10 pages and sometimes reach 1,000's of pages, without cost data.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;
 
'''Request for quotation (RFQ)'''

Customers issue RFQs when they want to buy large amounts of a commodity and price is not the only issue—for example, when availability or delivering or service are considerations. RFQs can be very detailed, so proposals written to RFQs can be lengthy but are generally much shorter than an RFP-proposal.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; RFQ proposals consist primarily of cost data, with brief narratives addressing customer issues, such as quality control.
 
'''Invitation for bid (IFB)'''

Customers issue IFBs when they are buying some service, such as construction. The requirements are detailed, but the primary consideration is price. For example, a customer provides architectural blueprints for contractors to bid on. These proposals can be lengthy but most of the length comes from cost-estimating data and detailed schedules.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

'''Request for information (RFI)'''

Sometimes before a customer issues an RFP or RFQ or IFB, the customer will issue a [[Request for Information]] (RFI). The purpose of the RFI is to gain "marketing intelligence" about what products, services, and vendors are available. RFIs are used to shape final RFPs, RFQs, and IFBs, so potential vendors take great care in responding to these requests, hoping to shape the eventual formal solicitation toward their products or services.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

===Informally solicited proposal===
Informally solicited proposals are typically the result of conversations held between a vendor and a prospective customer. The customer is interested enough in a product or service to ask for a proposal. Typically, the customer does not ask for competing proposals from other vendors. This type of proposal is known as a sole-source proposal. There are no formal requirements to respond. But they choose good quality of product."

===Unsolicited proposal===
Unsolicited proposals are marketing brochures. They are always generic, with no direct connection between customer needs or specified requirements. Vendors use them to introduce a product or service to a prospective customer. They are often used as "leave-behinds" at the end of initial meetings with or customers or "give-aways" at trade shows or other public meetings. They are not designed to close a sale, just introduce the possibility of a sale.&lt;ref&gt;Khalsa,Mahan. Franklin Covey, [http://www.franklincovey.com/saletraininggroup.php-Let's Get Real]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

===Formally solicited proposals===
# Requirements Matrix, which matches customer requirements with the paragraph and page numbers of where those requirements are addressed in the proposal
# Executive Summary, which outlines the primary benefits of the vendors's solutions to the customer's requirements
# Technical Volume, which demonstrates how each requirement will be met
# Management Volume, which describes how the program will be managed
# Cost Volume, which provides all costing data, as well as implementation plans and schedules&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

=== Informally solicited business proposal ===
# A description of the seller's capabilities or products
# A discussion of key issues
# A description of the buyer's specifications and how they will be met
# The cost of the offering
# A schedule for delivery of the products or services
# Proof of prior experience i.e. Testimonials from previous customers, Descriptions of previous projects&lt;ref name=Ricci/&gt;

==Managing business proposals==

Managing proposals presents an enormous challenge for sales and marketing teams. Many established management methods are ill-suited to deal with the broader issues associated with the production and delivery of proposals. In these cases, organizations often rely on outsourcing by identifying a proposal manager to support their proposal development needs.  

===The process of proposal management===
Proposal management is an inherently collaborative process. It often consists of the following basic roles and responsibilities:
* '''Creator''' – responsible for creating and editing content.
* '''Editor''' – responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization.
* '''Publisher''' – responsible for releasing the content for use.
* '''Administrator''' – responsible for managing access permissions to documents and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles.
* '''Consumer''' or viewer – the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared.

Increasingly, the term proposal management is being used to suggest that engagement with the proposal process is important to more than just the sales team, and should also affect those working in marketing, legal, and sales.

There is also a trend towards using [[proposal software|proposal management software]] that allows users to quickly and easily create proposals, collaborate with team members, track and analyze [[customer engagement]].

==Proposal writing==

Writing a successful proposal can be made easier through the development of a proposal checklist that contains the necessary standardized information that is typically contained in 80% of all of your sales proposals. This makes it much easier for the proposal writer to build a shell and then research the roughly missing 20%. For example, the Company Name, Mission Statement, History, Qualifications should remain the same for most proposals leaving the Pricing section and specific Product and Service options specific to the customer to be customized for the current target customer. At times, the process can be tedious, but the steps are pretty basic. Besides solicited and unsolicited proposals, the others that exist include internal proposals and sole-source contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Hamper, Robert J,. and L. Sue Baugh. Handbook for Writing Proposals. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. eBook Collection/(EBSCOhost). Wed. 15 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal proposals===
Internal proposals are ideas or projects that are presented to whomever holds the position of top management in a company. These types of proposals can be written by a particular individual, group, department, or division of a particular company. One example of this is when the manager of a product line writes a proposal suggesting that the company should robotize the production process. Some advantages to this includes easier communication, knowing the client's needs and making fast decisions. Some advantages to this may include competition from other companies and the loss of management champions.&lt;ref&gt;Hamper, Robert J,. and L. Sue Baugh. Handbook for Writing Proposals. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. eBook Collection/(EBSCOhost). Web. 15 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sole-source contract===
These types of proposals are made when a private firm, government agency, or association negotiates to supply a service or product to a single company and when a company has excellent credibility and a track record of achievements. The standard format for this type of proposal consists of information about a specific product, including the price and delivery schedules. Some advantages to this include not having to have resources to win a contract and the firm or client knows what time the work will be coming.

===Format===
Proposals are based on research, making it important for the researcher of the proposal to know about their client. The researcher must know the background of the idea that is being presented and show that he or she is well prepared to deal with a problem or situation their client has. The research for a company, institute, firm, etc. is done in advance, thereby increasing the chances of a well done proposal and the reader of the proposal will have a good idea of the outcome from the research that has been done. A general format for proposals includes the title page, abstract, scholarly statement of the problem and the method to solve it, the budget, and biographical information.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” Journal of Business Communication. 5.1 (1967): 13-20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 Apr. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title===
As small as it may seem, it is important that the title page be curt and definite. It would be a good idea to use key words for the purpose of indexing as long as it written in a relevant pattern.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Abstract===
This part of the proposal should state the situation, method, goal, scope, and the expected outcome. It usually consists of 200 words. Carl B. Palmer, Chief of Sponsored Research, Grants and Research Contracts, Office Space Science, and NASA says that the summary of an abstract has to be “short, lean, and all muscle.” He also points out that managers usually take a short glance at the abstract and will only concentrate on the proposal itself if a message comes through.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Statement and method===
It is important to highlight the main idea that is being presented. First the writer of the proposal should state what the idea is and do something to make it unique. Next, the writer should explain what to do with the idea. Be sure to avoid phrases such as: “No one has thought of doing this before” or “This is entirely original.” Doing so, will make the writer seem dull and inattentive.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Budget===
The writer of the proposal includes the grant and the total amounts of money it is going to be paid by it. It is stressed that the pay scale must be compatible with the company's scale. The money of researchers is part of a single person's company salary and because of this, a business is required to take away some of the duties of a researcher. The writer includes the estimated costs of disposable materials, equipment, and supplies. This part of the proposal would also consist of travel, publication costs, and direct costs.&lt;ref&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” ''Journal of Business Communication''. 5.1 (1967): 13–20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biographical information===
This part of the proposal basically deals with proving to the client that the person writing and submitting the proposal is capable of doing the job. Everyone that contributed to the making of the proposal is mentioned, including their achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” ''Journal of Business Communication''. 5.1 (1967): 13-20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually, a proposal uses persuasion to get its audience to buy into their idea. One example is when a proposal tries to persuade one or more sponsors to invest in a project. Another example of using a proposal to persuade a client is when the company writing the proposal is asking for a grant.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. Proposal Planning &amp; Writing. 3rd edition. Connecticut. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; The categories that can involve grants include social services, health care, religions, philanthropy, economic development, government, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. ''Proposal Planning &amp; Writing''. 3rd edition. Connecticut. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Persuasion can only work when these components are involved; sponsor values, applicant credibility, proposal logics, and proposal psychologics. Another way to make proposals persuasive is to connect the ideas of a project to the sponsor's values or problems of interest.

===Sponsor values===
Sponsors or grantmakers main focuses include any specific dilemma, inequities or injustices. Their mission is to fill in the space between the categories of  “what is” and “what ought to be.” One example is an organization trying to prevent child abuse called The Prevent Abuse Foundation. Their activities include giving support to families and children and teaching about the abuse and how to eliminate it. In addition to this, the foundation serves grass roots, community-based groups with technical and professional assistance, sharing the best program practices and evaluation techniques.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. Models of Proposal Planning &amp;Writing. Connecticut. Praeger Publishers. 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applicant credibility===
An applicant's job is to authorize organizational, individual, and project credibility. When an organization is proposing an idea to be presented by a project director, it is important for them to have credibility. Being persuasive is also one of the keys to success. An organization would try to convince its target of how different and unique it is from any other company. One example is a biology department at a university asking for money to do research in genetics. The department may go on to say that it has had 30 years of medical studies in biology and that their research inspects both hormonal and genetic elements that causes gene regulation.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

===Proposal logics===
This basically deals with the making of proposal elements that illustrates an identified gap, an improved situation, and resulting benefits to the intended population. Benefits serve as the good things that will happen by completing the objectives that are presented. The components must reflect a relationship between the sponsor values and the project that is being proposed. An exact description of the problem or need is required along with the purpose of the organization, funds and how to complete the objections. It also includes a timeline and a summarization of  the intended audience.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

===Proposal psychologies===
Sponsors would usually provide money for both psychological and logical reasons. Proposal psychologics tend to the emotional needs of the sponsor. The components that can be found in a successful proposal include passion, ownership, energy, trust, and commitment. Sponsors use grants as investments. Sponsors need to feel that you are serious about helping them with their problems. One example can be a proposal to a federal agency and a private college that describes its long history of achievement by working with community partners, controlling national programs that helps the intended population, and institutionalizing project activities. The project partners have worked with grant related initiatives which includes a six-year joint teacher education program among the Midwestern Regional College and the College of Native Americans. The ideas the project director has for Native American middle school kids includes Achievement in Math, Math and Science Immersion and Kids Math Camp.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;
As long as a proposal expresses interest and concern for the values and ideal of the sponsor, there is a good chance for success.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15248">'''Reshoring''' (also known as '''onshoring''', '''inshoring''' and '''backshoring''') is the act of reintroducing domestic manufacturing to a country. It is the reverse process of [[offshoring]], where manufacturing is moved to another country where labor is cheaper. 

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; considers the potential for automation to drive companies to reshore production, reducing the role of labor in the proess, and offers suggestions as to how governments can respond.
 
== United States ==
For the last twenty years, American companies have been "[[offshoring]]" manufacturing to low cost countries such as [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]]. 
Even as recently as 2008 many companies were offshoring or [[nearshoring]] their manufacturing. In 2010, a group of manufacturers started the Reshoring Initiative, a movement focusing on bringing manufacturing jobs for American companies back to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manortool.com/blog/top-reasons-for-reshoring-in-manufacturing/|title=Top Reasons for Reshoring in Manufacturing - Manor Tool|date=2015-01-29|work=Manor Tool|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reshoring Initiative reports that 140,000 American jobs were lost in 2003 due to offshoring. Eleven years later in 2014, the United States recovered 10,000 of those offshored positions; this marked the highest net gain in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.industryweek.com/competitiveness/reshoring-numbers|title=Reshoring: By the Numbers|date=2017-03-20|work=IndustryWeek|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; America was deep into a recession and American citizens were pressuring companies to keep jobs in country. Reshoring efforts have become increasingly popular because of the positive impact on the domestic job market, as well as lowering the overall production cost for American manufacturing companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reshorenow.org/what-is-reshoring/|title=What is Reshoring? {{!}} Reshoring Initiative|last=Engineers|first=dgs Marketing|website=reshorenow.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voice of America says that bringing manufacturing and jobs back to America is the right thing to do.&lt;ref name="bsc4"&gt;{{Cite web

=== Government response ===
In response to the recession, President Obama launched the [[SelectUSA]] program in 2011,the first federal program to promote and facilitate U.S. investment in partnership with our states. This program and website helps companies connect with resources available on a Federal, State and local level. In January 2012, President Obama Issued a Call to Action to Invest in America at the White House "Insourcing American Jobs" Forum.&lt;ref name="whitehouse1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this forum, he met with representatives from companies such as [[Otis Elevator]], [[DuPont]], NOVO1, [[Master Lock]] and many more, all of which had recently brought jobs back or made significant investments in the United States. In 2013, during his State of the Union speech President Obama stated that he wanted America to be a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing. He asked that manufacturers like [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[Apple Inc.]] bring manufacturing back the U.S. He talked about the new Innovation Institutes that are working on innovation and technology such as 3D printing that will help companies with Lean Manufacturing. He talked about the innovation in renewable and clean energy and how our future is dependent on both. The cameras panned the crowd and focused on Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, and explained that Apple had made a commitment to bring some of its manufacturing back to Silicon Valley.&lt;ref name="whitehouse2"&gt;{{Cite web

=== Success stories ===
Companies such as ET Water Systems, GE Appliances and Caterpillar found that with the increase of labor costs in Japan and China, the cost of shipping and custom fees, it cost only about 10% more to manufacture in America.&lt;ref name="econ1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in technology such as Digital Manufacturing and Automation have made bringing manufacturing back to the United States both cost effective and possible. Especially advances in [[3D printing]] technologies bring manufacturers closer to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durach|first=Christian F.|last2=Kurpjuweit|first2=Stefan|last3=Wagner|first3=Stephan M.|date=2017-09-25|title=The impact of additive manufacturing on supply chains|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/IJPDLM-11-2016-0332|journal=International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management|volume=47|issue=10|pages=954–971|doi=10.1108/ijpdlm-11-2016-0332|issn=0960-0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adidas]], for example, plans producing highly customized shoes with 3D printers in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adidas-manufacturing/adidas-to-mass-produce-3d-printed-shoe-with-silicon-valley-start-up-idUSKBN1790F6|title=Adidas to mass-produce 3D-printed shoe with Silicon Valley start-up|date=7 April 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this advanced technology companies are creating new innovative products for the U.S. market.

Not all manufacturing should return to the U.S.&lt;ref name="bsc1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reshoringinstitute.org/reshoring-blog/china-its-in-the-cards/|title=China – It’s in the Cards|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Reshoring Institute Blog|accessdate=17 March 2014|author=Daisie Hobson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the middle class in China, India and other countries has created markets for the products made in those countries. As the U.S. has a "Made in U.S.A." program other countries support products made in their countries as well.  Localization, the process of manufacturing products for the local market, is an approach to keeping some manufacturing offshore and bringing some of it back. Besides the cost savings of manufacturing closer to the market, the lead time for adapting to changes in the market is faster.

There have been several very successful stories of companies that have reshored including most of the companies mentioned above. In most cases hundreds if not thousands of jobs were created or reinstated. In the case of  [[Starbucks]], in 2012 it saved American Mug and Stein Company in East Liverpool, Ohio from bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="strb1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially only twelve people were put back to work but it was just the beginning for Starbucks. CEO Howard Schultz was compelled to take action; he teamed up with Opportunity Finance Network to found Create Jobs for USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://createjobsforusa.org/ |title=Create Jobs for USA |website=Opportunity Finance Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seeded the foundation with an initial grant of $5 million.  Later that year Starbucks announced that they are building another manufacturing facility in Georgia that will employ 140 people.&lt;ref name="strb2"&gt;{{Cite web

=== Avoiding failure ===
There have been some cases of reshoring that weren't successful. Otis Elevators’ reshoring effort did not go well.&lt;ref name="bsc2"&gt;{{Cite web

 |author=Rosemary Coates
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otis says it failed to consider the consequences of the new location and tried to do too much at once, including a supply-chain software implementation. This is not an uncommon reshoring scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn’t so simple, and there are a lot of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of reshoring. Some companies pursue reshoring with their own internal staff.  But reshoring projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement.  In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community.  To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in Reshoring.&lt;ref name="bsc3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bluesilkconsulting.com/reshoring/|title=Are you ready to evaluate Reshoring?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Blue Silk Consulting Reshoring|author=Rosemary Coates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], companies have used the reintroduction of domestic [[call centres]] as a [[unique selling point]]. In 2014, the [[RSA Insurance Group]] completed a move of call centres back to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insurancetimes.co.uk/rsa-completes-move-to-uk-only-call-centres/1409402.article|title=http://www.insurancetimes.co.uk/rsa-completes-move-to-uk-only-call-centres/1409402.article|work=Insurance Times|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call centre industry in [[India]] has been hit by reshoring, as businesses including [[British Telecom]], [[Santander UK]] and [[Aviva]] all announced they would move operations back to Britain in order to boost the economy and regain customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-14/news/29773439_1_uk-bank-uk-bpo-uk-companies|title=India may no longer be outsourcing hub as UK companies such as Aviva, BT &amp; Santander move work to home country|work=The Economic Times|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Rushmore Reviews''' is a company based in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] that collects, analyzes and publishes [[Offset Well Data|offset well data]] for participating [[Company|Operators]] in the [[oil industry]]. The content of their extensive, global database is exclusively available to Review participants, who are then able to use the shared data to benchmark their own performance against others in the industry.

==History==
The Reviews began in 1993 when a group of oil operators, led by [[BP]], outsourced the production of the data collection and analysis project they had been conducting since 1988 to the Rushmore Reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epmag.com/EP-Magazine/archive/Benchmark-a-drilling-boost_2795| title=2003 Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a joint venture between two independent companies, Rushmore Associates Ltd (founded by Peter and Helen Rushmore) and the Sigma Consultancy (founded by Tim Stapenhurst and wife Pat). They shared offices and provided data to participants through a web-based portal. The Sigma Consultancy was purchased from the Stapenhursts on 30 April 2010, by Peter and Helen Rushmore, leaving the Rushmores the sole owners of the Rushmore Reviews.

Participants meet annually in Aberdeen Scotland to discuss and agree any changes to the data being shared and the rules under which it is shared. The 2013 annual meetings, hosted by both Helen and Peter Rushmore, marked 25 years of the Reviews, and 20 years since the outsourcing to Rushmore Reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rushmorereviews.com/np/issue26_np_web.html| title=Companies December 2013 newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth of the Reviews==
Initially in 1989 the Reviews consisted of twelve operators, who agreed a process for sharing [[Offset Well Data|offset drilling data]] for the first time. A standard set of metrics and definitions were employed by all twelve, and quality control was added to ensure the data was sufficiently reliable to be of real use to them. This became known as the Drilling Performance Review (DPR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rushmorereviews.com/liveMarketing/Reviews/Dpr| title=DPR History}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 1993 the DPR was managed by the Operators themselves. However this was not a core activity for them and it was agreed that the DPR would be outsourced to Rushmore Reviews, who worked to increase the scope of the Reviews, as requested by the existing participants. Eventually the DPR grew to hold data for more than 50,000 wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rushmorereviews.com/livemarketing/| title=Company website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants meet annually in [[Aberdeen]] to consider the Reviews and discuss/agree upon any revisions they require for the following year, ensuring that the Reviews continue to evolve and grow. 1994 saw the establishment of the Completions Performance Review (CPR), now containing information and schematics on the completion of over 12,000 offset wells in over 60 countries. Following an increasing number of well abandonments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spe.org/twa/print/archives/2013/2013v9n3/13_Tech101_FINAL.pdf| title=SPE archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; demand grew among participants for the Abandonment Performance Review (APR) which began in 2008. The APR contains data for over 300 permanently [[Oil well#Abandonment|abandoned wells]], mainly situated in Europe.

In 2011 the Interventions Performance Review (IPR) was initiated after new products and services available in the industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slb.com/services/well_intervention.aspx| title=Schumberger Intervention services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bakerhughes.com/products-and-services/completions/wellbore-intervention| title=Baker Hughes Well Interventions}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased the productivity of [[Well interventions|interventions]] for some participants of other Reviews, yet there was no performance benchmarking available in this area.

The Shale Performance Review (SPR), starting in 2012 contains information on the drilling, completion and frac'ing of offset multi-stage frac’ed wells. The SPR dataset includes multiple reservoir types, such as shale, sandstone, carbonate, siltstone, limestone and others. Over 7000 wells drilled since 2011 are included, covering Canada, USA, Argentina, Australia, China, Colombia, Jordan, Indonesia, Poland and Sweden.

In an increasingly competitive industry, [[benchmarking]] has grown popular amongst oil and gas Operators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/US_E_and_P_benchmark_study_-_June_2012/$FILE/US_EP_benchmark_study_2012.pdf| title=US E&amp;P benchmark study}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining why participation in the Rushmore Reviews has grown steadily. The dataset contains a large amount of [[Offset Well Data|offset well data]] encompassing drilling, completions, shale, interventions and abandonments. As of 2013, the Reviews contain data for over 50,000 wells, from conventional [[hydrocarbon]] to [[shale]] and [[coal seam gas]] wells. Over 100 countries feature in the Reviews, and the vast majority of Operating companies have made contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dmi-drillers.com/performance.html| title=DMI Drillers article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012, Rushmore Reviews now hold a second set of annual meetings in [[Houston]] [[Texas]] for participants in the Shale Performance Review which continues to grow rapidly, with the notable addition of [[Chesapeake Energy]] to the Review in 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rushmorereviews.com/liveMarketing/News/article5| title=News, Rushmorereviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second-largest natural gas producer in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chk.com/Pages/default.aspx| title=Chesapeake.com homepage| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315143547/http://www.chk.com/Pages/default.aspx| archivedate=15 March 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IHS Acquisition==
On 5 February 2015, Denver based [[IHS Inc.|IHS]] acquired Rushmore Reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://press.ihs.com/press-release/corporate-financial/ihs-acquires-rushmore-reviews-leading-service-provider-drilling-an| title=IHS Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participant Website Tools==
Participants of the Reviews are provided with secure website access in order to view [[Offset Well Data|offset well data]]. The data is searchable and can be filtered by the user. The data may also be downloaded in Excel format.  Additionally there are a range of analytical tools available to study the data. These include performance metrics (P10, P25, P50, P75, P90, Min, Mean, Max etc.) as well as the facility to draw a range of different chart types.

Amongst the collection of tools, the [[Rushmore Drilling Index|Rushmore Drilling Index (RDI)]] and [[Rushmore Drilling Index &amp; Estimated Drilling Days|Rushmore Estimated Drilling Data (REDD)]], both designed and owned by the company, are particularly noteworthy. Designed as objective tools for well planning, they index the difficulty and indicate the amount of time a planned well is likely to take to drill to target depth.

Small and Medium Enterprises in [[Afghanistan]] employ 10 to 500 employees, have sales up to US$1 million and [[paid-in capital]] of up to US$1 million. Lenders are banks, financing companies, some MFIs, local money exchange service providers ([[Hawala]] dealers), credit unions and societies. Most of these loans are disbursed against collateral of [[title deeds]], land deeds, property and automobile deeds. Some small loans are secured by neighbors, personal guarantees and character.

The SME loans that are disbursed by these lenders range from US$2,000-250,000.

The majority of SMEs operate in cities such as Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Jalalabad, Kunduz, Faizabad, Maimana, JawzJan and Taloqan.

[[Interest rate]]s are marked from 12% up to 24% depending on mutual deals, loan amounts and credit history. Most formal lenders charge 0.5% to 2.0% of the loan amount as an up-front processing fee.

A '''spokesman''', '''spokeswoman''' or '''spokesperson'''  is someone engaged or elected to speak on behalf of others.

==Duties and function==
In the present media-sensitive world, many organizations are increasingly likely to employ  professionals who have received formal training in [[journalism]], [[Communication studies|communications]], [[public relations]] and [[Public administration|public affairs]] in this role in order to ensure that public announcements are made in the most appropriate fashion and through the most appropriate channels to maximize the impact of favorable messages, and to minimize the impact of unfavorable messages. Celebrity spokesmen such as popular local and national sports stars (such as [[Michael Jordan]] or [[Bob Uecker]]) or television and film stars (such as [[Beyoncé]] or [[Michael J. Fox]]) are often chosen as spokespeople for commercial advertising. As of August 2017, [[Kayleigh McEnany]] and Michael Tyler (DNC spokesman) served as spokesmen of the RNC and DNC, respectively.

==Responsibilities==
Unlike an individual giving a personal [[testimonial]], it is the job of a spokesperson to faithfully represent and advocate for the organization's positions, even when these conflict with his/her own opinion. As a result, spokespeople are generally selected from experienced, long-time employees or other people who are known to support the organization's goals.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7914-3762-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Michael B. |title=Corporate communications for executives |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1998 |pages=13 |isbn=0-7914-3762-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
A corporation may be represented in public by its [[chief executive officer]], [[chairman]] or [[president (corporate title)|president]], [[chief financial officer]], [[counsel]] or external legal advisor. In addition, on a day-to-day level and for more routine announcements, the job may be delegated to the corporate communications or [[investor relations]] departments (or equivalents), who will act as spokespeople.

In the particle physics community, large collaborations of physicists elect one (or two) spokespeople or leader(s) of the collaboration.  The spokesperson in such cases is the lead scientist of the collaboration, not a public speaker.&lt;ref name="CMS Management"&gt;{{cite web|title=CMS Management on cms.web.cern.ch|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/content/cms-management|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each collaboration chooses the roles and responsibilities of the spokesperson for internal purposes, but typically spokespeople also have defined roles for liaising with the host laboratory and/or funding agencies.

==History==

===1984-99: Founding and early years===
[[File:Bill Clinton talking at TED 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]] addresses TED, 2007]]
TED was conceived in 1984 by architect and graphic designer [[Richard Saul Wurman]], who observed a [[technological convergence|convergence]] of the fields of technology, entertainment, and design (that is, "TED").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tatvasoft world of inspiring people and their ideas |url=https://www.ted.com/profiles/5778538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first conference, organized by Harry Marks and Wurman in the same year, featured demos of the [[compact disc]], co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and one of the first demonstrations of the [[Apple Macintosh]] computer.&lt;ref name="addict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;Cadwalladr, Carole [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr Ted – the ultimate forum for blue-sky thinking] July 4, 2010, [[The Guardian]], Retrieved September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations were given by famous mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and influential members of the [[digerati]] community, like [[Nicholas Negroponte]] and [[Stewart Brand]]. The event was financially unsuccessful; it took six years before the second conference was organized.&lt;ref name="ted.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/16|title=History of TED {{!}} Our Organization {{!}} About {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 onward, a growing community of "TEDsters" gathered annually at the event in California State University Monterey Bay, until 2009, when it was relocated to [[Long Beach, California]] due to a substantial increase in attendees.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Victoria|title=Long Beach to host influential TED conference|date=January 16, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/16/business/fi-ted16|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the speakers had been drawn from the fields of expertise behind the acronym TED, but during the nineties, the roster of presenters broadened to include scientists, philosophers, musicians, religious leaders, philanthropists, and many others.&lt;ref name="ted.com"/&gt;

===2000-16: Recent growth===
[[File:Chris Anderson 2007.jpg|thumb|Curator [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] in 2007]]
In 2000, Wurman, looking for a successor at age 65, met with new-media entrepreneur and TED enthusiast [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] to discuss future happenings. Anderson's UK media company [[Future plc|Future]] bought TED. In November 2001, Anderson's non-profit The [[Sapling Foundation]] (motto: ''"fostering the spread of great ideas."'')&lt;ref name="sapling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/pages/42 |title=About TED: Who we are: Who owns TED |work=TED: Ideas Worth Sharing |publisher=TED Conferences, LLC |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquired TED from Future for £6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/i-was-losing-1-million-a-day-every-day-for-18-months-meet-chris/|title='I was losing $1 million a day, every day for 18 months': Meet Chris Anderson, the man behind TED talks|date=April 29, 2016|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, Anderson gave a TED Talk in which he explained his vision of the conference and his future role of [[curator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/chris_anderson_shares_his_vision_for_ted.html|title=TED's nonprofit transition|last=Anderson|first=Chris|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wurman left after the 2002 conference.

In 2006, attendance cost was $4,400 per person and was by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/invitations|title=Getting Invited (attendees)|work=TED: Ideas Worth Spreading|publisher=TED Conferences, LLC|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools, and conference DVDs. The 2018 conference was $10,000 per attendee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences/ted-conference#h3--ted-conference-standard-membership|title=TED Conference|website=www.ted.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the conference was relocated to Vancouver.

TED is currently funded by a combination of various revenue streams, including conference attendance fees, corporate sponsorships, foundation support, licensing fees, and book sales. Corporate sponsorships are diverse, provided by companies such as [[Google]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[AOL]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], among others. Sponsors do not participate in the creative direction of the event, nor are they allowed to present on the main stage, in the interests of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How TED Works|url=https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/how-ted-works|website=TED.com|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=americanu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ochoa|first1=Rosmari|title=Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED): A case study on how complimentary on- and off-line approaches can build community and cultivate platformsfor innovation and creativity|url=https://www.american.edu/soc/communication/upload/Rosemari-Ochoa.pdf|website=American University School of Communication|publisher=American University|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TED Prize==
The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. Until 2010, it annually granted three individuals $100,000 and a "wish to change the world".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Giussani]].  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruno-giussani/ted-2008-day-2-dave-egger_b_89106.html "Day 2: Dave Eggers and Tutoring, Neil Turok and the next African Einstein, Karen Armstrong and the Charter for Compassion"], ''Huffington Post'', February 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference. Since 2010, in a changed selection process, a single winner is chosen to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts in achieving the winner's wish. In 2012, the prize was not awarded to an individual, but to a concept connected to the current global phenomenon of increasing [[urbanization]]. In 2013, the prize amount was increased to $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tedprize.org/|title=TED Prize {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.tedprize.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TED Prize winners in previous years:

In 2005, Chris Anderson hired [[June Cohen]] as Director of TED Media. In June 2006, after Cohen's idea of a TV show based on TED lectures was rejected by several networks, a selection of talks that had received the highest audience ratings was posted on the websites of TED, [[YouTube]], and [[iTunes]], under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0.&lt;ref name="giving"&gt;{{cite web |title=Giving Away Information, but Increasing Revenue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/technology/16ecom.html |publisher=NYT |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/tedtalksdirector|title=TED|work=YouTube|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only a handful of talks were posted, to test if there was an audience for them. In January of the next year, the number of TED Talks on the site had grown to 44, and they had been viewed more than three million times. On the basis of that success, the organization pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into its video production operations and into the development of a website to showcase about 100 of the talks.&lt;ref name="giving"/&gt;

In April 2007, the new TED.com was launched, developed by design firm Method. In subsequent years, the website has won many prizes, among which seven [[Webby Award]]s, iTunes' "Best Podcast of the Year" (2006-2010), the [[Communication Arts (magazine)|Communication Arts]] Interactive Award for "Information Design" in 2007, the OMMA Award for "video sharing" in 2008, the Web Visionary Award for "technical achievement" in 2008, [[The One Club|The One Show Interactive]] Bronze Award in 2008, the [[AIGA]] Annual Design Competition (2009), and a [[Peabody Award]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bibliotech.stanford.edu/conf11_speakers|title=2011 Speakers {{!}} BiblioTech Program|website=bibliotech.stanford.edu|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://method.com/about/awards|title=Work|website=Method|access-date=June 18, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807060646/http://method.com/about/awards|archivedate=August 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/ted.com|title=TED.com|website=www.peabodyawards.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TED Review|publisher=[[MacWorld]]|url=http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=707209|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Not sure if is exactly the right link.

As of January 2018, over 2600 TED talks had been posted.&lt;ref name="numbertalks"/&gt; Every week 5-7 new talks are published. In January 2009, the then number of videos had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the number of views totaled 500 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/06/27/ted-anniversary/|title=With 500 Million Views, TED Talks Provide Hope for Intelligent Internet Video|last=Kessler|first=Sarah|website=Mashable|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 13, 2012, TED reached its billionth video view.&lt;ref name="billion"/&gt; Chris Anderson in an interview in March 2012:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it's about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as "ideas worth spreading," building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/articles/teds-chris-anderson|title=TED’s Chris Anderson|website=Departures|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2012, [[Netflix]] announced a deal to [[streaming media|stream]] an initial series of 16 two-hour shows, consisting of TED Talks covering similar subjects, from multiple speakers. The content was made available to subscribers in the US, Canada, Latin America, the UK, and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/03/15/netflix-to-stream-ted-talks/|title=Netflix To Stream TED Talks|last=Savitz|first=Eric|website=Forbes|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosted by Jami Floyd, ''[[TED (conference)#TED.com|TED Talks NYC]]'' debuted on [[NYC Media|NYC Life]] on March 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TED TALKS IN NYC –FEATURING WORLD-RENOWNED TALKS FROM TED.COM – PREMIERES ON NYC LIFE |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |accessdate=January 17, 2012 |newspaper=.nyc.gov |date=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103151258/http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEDGlobal===
In 2005, under Anderson's supervision, a more internationally oriented sister conference was added, under the name TEDGlobal. It was held, in chronological order: in [[Oxford]], [[UK]] (2005), in [[Arusha]], Tanzania (2007, titled TEDAfrica), in Oxford again (2009 and 2010), and in [[Edinburgh]], UK (2011, 2012, and 2013). In 2014, it was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/ted_conferences_about_past_teds_v2|title=Past TEDs {{!}} Conferences {{!}} About {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was TED India, in [[Mysore]] (2009) and TEDGlobal London in [[London]] (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/tedgloballondon_programbrochure.pdf|title=TEDGlobal&gt;London Tuesday 16 June 2015|website=tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com|access-date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEDGlobal 2017 was held again in Arusha, Tanzania and it was curated and hosted by Emeka Okafor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ted-global-2017-arusha-tanzania|title=Ten years on, TEDGlobal is tackling Africa's education crisis|last=Christian|first=Bonnie|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 TEDGlobal conference ''Radical Openness'' was held in Edinburgh from June 25–29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEDGlobal 2012: Radical Openness|url=http://conferences.ted.com/TEDGlobal2012/|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===TED Translators (formerly The Open Translation Project (OTP))===
TED Translators started as TED Open Translation Project in May 2009 and aims to "[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English", according to TED Curator Chris Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/OpenTranslationProject|title=TED Open Translation Project|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OTP utilizes crowd-based subtitling platforms to translate the text of TED and TED-Ed videos, as well as to caption and translate videos created in the TEDx program (with its technology partner [[dotSUB]] until May 2012, and then with [[open source]] translation tool [[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]]). At the time of the launch, 300 translations had been done by 200 volunteer transcribers in 40 languages.&lt;ref name="TED"/&gt; In May 2015, over 70,000 sets of subtitles in 107 languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/participate/translate/otp-2014-annual-report|title=2014 annual report: TED Open Translation Project {{!}} Translate {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been completed by (an all-time total of) 38,173 volunteer translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amara.org/en/teams/ted/|title=Dashboard - TED {{!}} Amara|website=www.amara.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project contributed to a significant increase in international visitors to TED's website, with traffic from outside the US growing 350 percent, 600 percent growth in Asia, and more than 1000 percent in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/at-1-year-anniversary-teds-open-translation-project-celebrates-more-than-7000-completed-translations-from-4000-volunteers-in-75-languages-93683249.html|title=At 1-Year Anniversary, TED's Open Translation Project Celebrates More Than 7,000 Completed Translations From 4,000 Volunteers in 75 Languages|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEDx===
{{See also|List of TEDx conferences}}
TEDx are independent TED-like events, which can be organized by anyone who obtains a free license from TED, agreeing to follow certain principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/fashion/26TEDX.html|title=A Conference Makes Learning Free (and Sexy)|last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|date=September 24, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEDx events are non-profit but may use an admission fee or commercial sponsorship to cover costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/493#general-rules|title=TEDx Rules {{!}} Before you start {{!}} Organize a local TEDx event {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, speakers are not paid. They must also relinquish the copyrights to their materials, which TED may edit and distribute under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mypages.iit.edu/~tedxiit/|title=TEDxIIT|website=mypages.iit.edu|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TEDx event is organized by volunteers from the local community, and just like TED events, it lacks any commercial, religious, or political agenda. Its goal is to spark conversation, connection, and community.

As of January 2014, the TEDxTalks library contained some 30,000 films and presentations from over 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/|title=TED {{!}} TEDx Events {{!}} TEDxTalks|website=tedxtalks.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/06/19/heres-why-ted-and-tedx-are-so-incredibly-appealing-infographic/2/|title=Here's Why TED and TEDx are So Incredibly Appealing (infographic)|author=Mark Fidelman|date=June 19, 2012|work=Forbes|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, the TEDx archive surpassed 100,000 talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ted.com/achievement-unlocked-tedx-celebrates-100000-talks/|title=Achievement unlocked: TEDx celebrates 100,000 talks!|date=October 19, 2017|work=TED Blog|access-date=October 30, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, eight TEDx events were organised every day; raised up from five in June 2012, the previous year, in 133 countries.&lt;ref name="listen"&gt;Heller, Nathan [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/09/120709fa_fact_heller ''Listen and Learn''], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', July 9, 2012.

===TED Fellows===
[[File:TEDGlobal2012.jpg|thumb|TEDGlobal 2012 at the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]]]]
TED Fellows were introduced in 2007, during the first TEDAfrica conference in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], where 100 young people were selected from across the continent. Two years later, during TEDIndia, 99 Fellows were recruited, mainly from South Asia. In 2009, the Fellows program was initiated in its present form. For every TED or TEDGlobal conference, 20 Fellows are selected; a total of 40 new Fellows a year. Each year, 20 past Fellows are chosen to participate in the two-year Senior Fellows program (in which they will attend four more conferences).

Acceptance as a Fellow is not based on academic [[credential]]s, but mainly on past and current actions, and plans for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/248|title=Application tips {{!}} Apply to be a TED Fellow {{!}} TED Fellows Program {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides attending a conference free of charge, each Fellow takes part in a special program with [[mentorship|mentoring]] by experts in the field of spreading ideas, and he or she can give a short talk on the "TED Fellows" stage. Some of these talks are subsequently published on TED.com. Senior Fellows have additional benefits and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|title=Wired meets 2011's TED Fellows|last=Rowan|first=David|date=July 18, 2011|website=Wired|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175312/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|archive-date=July 20, 2011|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED-Ed===
TED-Ed is a category of TED talks which are short animated lessons aimed at children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ed.ted.com/about|title=Lessons Worth Sharing|website=TED-Ed|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates explanatory animation videos on various concepts. TED-Ed lessons are created in collaboration with educators and animators. Current advisers for Ted-Ed lessons include [[Aaron Sams]], Jackie Bezos, John Hunter, [[Jonathan Bergmann]], [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Sir Ken Robinson]], [[Melinda Gates|Melinda French Gates]], and [[Sal Khan|Salman Khan]].

===TEDMED===
{{Main|TEDMED}}

[[TEDMED]] is an annual conference concerned with health and medicine. It is an independent event operating under license from the nonprofit TED conference.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/tedmed_a_new_pa/|title=TEDMED: a new partnership|date=January 19, 2010|website=TED Blog|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEDMED was founded in 1998 by TED's founder Ricky Wurman. After years of inactivity, in 2008 Wurman sold TEDMED to entrepreneur [[Marc Hodosh]], who recreated and relaunched it. The first event under Hodosh's ownership was held in San Diego in October 2009. In January 2010, TED.com began including videos of TEDMED talks on the TED website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second Hodosh-owned edition of TEDMED took place in October 2010, also in San Diego.  It sold out for a second year and attracted notable healthcare leaders and Hollywood celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDMED|title=Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne with Nathaniel Pearson at TEDMED 2010|date=December 8, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX0culYjU_A|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Jay S. Walker|Jay Walker]] and a group of executives and investors purchased TEDMED from Hodosh for $16 million with future additional payments of as much as $9 million. The conference was then moved to Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

==Criticism==

===Pricing===
Frank Swain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2832933/The-man-HEARS-Wi-Fi-Deaf-man-uses-hearing-aid-listen-invisible-networks.html|title=What does the internet SOUND like?|website=Mail Online|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deaf journalist, refused to participate in a TEDx event without getting paid. He said that it is unacceptable that TED, which is a non-profit organization, charges attendees $6,000 but cannot afford to pay anything to their speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/futures-exchange/why-im-not-a-tedx-speaker-3be652b8eccb|title=Why I'm Not a TEDx Speaker|last=Swain|first=Frank|date=November 8, 2013|website=Medium|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers at the independently-organized TEDx talks may not be paid; speakers at the official, yearly, TED Conference are compensated for their talks.

[[Sarah Lacy]] of ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' and ''[[TechCrunch]]'' wrote in 2010 that TED attendees complained of elitism from a "hierarchy of parties throughout the LA-area with strict lists and security" after the sessions. She gave TED credit for making talks free online or live streamed.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/09/ted-now-with-more-elitism/|title=TED: Now with More Elitism?|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED Talk content===
Disagreements have also occurred between TED speakers and organizers. In her 2010 TED Talk, comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] referred to adopting a "retarded" child. TED organizer [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] objected via his [[Twitter]] account, leading to a Twitter skirmish between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/14/ted-organizer-trashes-speaker-fails-social-iq-test/|title=TED Organizer Trashes Speaker, Fails Social IQ Test|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/the-ted-v-sarah-silverman-fight-turns-really-retarded/|title=The TED v. Sarah Silverman Fight Turns Really Retarded|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, noted statistician [[Nassim Taleb]] called TED a "monstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers." He claimed TED curators did not initially post his talk "warning about the financial crisis" on their site on purely cosmetic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taleb|first=Nassim|year=2010|title=The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a New Section: 'On Robustness and Fragility'|publisher=Random House Trade|page=336|isbn=0-8129-7381-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Hanauer]] spoke at TED University, challenging the popular belief that top income earners in America are the engines of job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/here-is-the-full-inequality-speech-and-slideshow-that-was-too-hot-for-ted/257323/|title=Here Is the Full Inequality Speech and Slideshow That Was Too Hot for TED|author=National Journal|date=May 17, 2012|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TED was accused of censoring the talk by not posting it on the website.&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/342291/20120517/ted-censors-nick-hanauer-talk-income-inequality.htm|title=TED Censors Seattle Multimillionaire Nick Hanauer?s Talk On Income Inequality, Taxing The Rich|date=May 17, 2012|work=International Business Times|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/features/restoration-calls/too-hot-for-ted-income-inequality-20120516|title=Too Hot for TED: Income Inequality|work=www.nationaljournal.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[National Journal]]'' reported Chris Anderson had reacted by saying the talk probably ranked as one of the most politically controversial talks they had ever run, and they needed to be careful about when they posted it.&lt;ref name=IBT/&gt; Anderson officially responded, indicating that TED only posts one talk every day, selected from many.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tedchris.posterous.com/131417405|title=Good night, Posterous|website=tedchris.posterous.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' staff writer Bruce Upbin described Hanauer's talk as "shoddy and dumb"&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Upbin.

Following a TEDx talk by [[Rupert Sheldrake]], TED issued a statement saying their scientific advisors believed that "there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake's more radical claims" made in the talk and recommended that it "should not be distributed without being framed with caution". The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors. The move and framing prompted accusations of censorship, to which TED responded by saying the accusations were "simply not true" and that Sheldrake's talk was "up on our website".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/19/the-debate-about-rupert-sheldrakes-talk/ |title=The debate about Rupert Sheldrake's talk |publisher=TED |date=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bignell, Paul |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ted-conference-censorship-row-8563105.html |title=TED conference censorship row |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TED has also been accused of censoring a presentation by [[Graham Hancock]] in which he discussed the effects of legal versus illegal drugs, by removing it from YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/04/11/ted-bans-graham-hancocks-talk-on-consciousness/|title=Banned TED Talk: Graham Hancock – The War on Consciousness|publisher=|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor [[Benjamin H. Bratton|Benjamin Bratton]] at [[University of California, San Diego]], TED Talks' efforts at fostering progress in socio-economics, science, philosophy, and technology have been ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/30/we-need-to-talk-about-ted "We need to talk about TED"], Prof. Benjamin Bratton, ''The Guardian'', December 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Anderson responded that some critics have a misconception of TED's goals, and failed to recognise that TED aimed to instill excitement in the audience in the same way the speaker felt it. He stated that TED only wishes to bring news of the significance of certain topics to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/ted-not-civilisational-disaster-but-wikipedia "TED is not a recipe for civilisational disaster"], Chris Anderson, ''The Guardian'', January 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The HTML500''' is a multi-city [[Canada|Canadian]] technology [[Academic conference|conference]] that teaches 500 attendees per event the basics of [[HTML]] and [[CSS]] programming.&lt;ref name="techvibes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/lighthouse-labs-bridges-digital-literacy-gap-with-html500-2015-12-30|title=Lighthouse Labs Bridges Digital Literacy Gap with HTML500 - Techvibes.com|publisher=techvibes.com|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to promote [[web development]] and [[web programming]] literacy among Canadian youth, and open the doors for those who may be interested in pursuing careers in [[IT|technology]].&lt;ref name="vancouversun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/HTML+Vancouver+free+coding+camp+attracts+plus+waitlist+combines+with+tech+fair/10752005/story.html|title=HTML 500: Vancouver’s free coding camp attracts 2,000-plus on waitlist, combines with tech job fair|publisher=vancouversun.com|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its annual events are held in four Canadian cities: [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], [[London, Ontario|London]], and [[Calgary]].

== History ==

'''The HTML500''' was founded in 2013 by Canadian entrepreneurs Khurram Virani and Jeremy Shaki. Virani and Shaki are the co-founders of [[Lighthouse Labs]], the largest Canadian [[web developer]] [[Coding Bootcamp]] .&lt;ref name="biv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biv.com/article/2015/5/hybrid-coding-boot-camp-aims-bring-global-tech-sec/|title=‘Hybrid’ coding boot camp aims to bring tech sector to rural Canada &amp;#124; Technology &amp;#124; Business in Vancouver|publisher=biv.com|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelondoner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelondoner.ca/2015/01/09/the-html500-makes-london-stop-in-february|title=The HTML500 makes London stop in February &amp;#124; Londoner|author=nurun.com|publisher=thelondoner.ca|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighthouse Labs acts as the official sponsor and parent company of the conferences. In an interview with [[BetaKit]], Shaki said of the educational initiative, "It’s about more people in Canada understanding the value of digital literacy. It’s about trying to get our governments and other major Canadian institutions involved in the conversation."&lt;ref name="betakit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betakit.com/the-html500-is-more-than-another-learn-to-code-event-2/|title=The HTML500 is More Than Another Learn to Code Event &amp;#124; BetaKit|publisher=betakit.com|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the event expanded to three additional Canadian cities: [[Calgary]], [[Toronto]], and [[London, Ontario|London]].

The second annual event in [[Vancouver]] had over 2500 applicants, of which the official 500 were selected through a lottery process.&lt;ref name="globalnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1791427/html500-teaches-basics-of-coding-opens-doors-to-b-c-s-tech-sector/|title=HTML500 teaches basics of coding, opens doors to B.C.&amp;#8217;s tech sector - BC &amp;#124; Globalnews.ca|publisher=globalnews.ca|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the attendees were women.&lt;ref name="vancouversun"/&gt; Beginning with the second Vancouver event, the Vancouver Economic Commission began running a career fair in tandem with the day's activities to further provide career resources to aspiring [[web developer]]s.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/html500-coding-class-prepares-calgarians-for-booming-tech-sector-1.2939763|title=HTML500 coding class prepares Calgarians for booming tech sector - Calgary - CBC News|publisher=cbc.ca|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-city events are routinely covered on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] television network.&lt;ref name="cbc"/&gt;

== Event activities ==

Each event is designed to host 500 attendees. In each city, 50 local technology companies are chosen to help participate by managing and providing teaching assistance at one of the event's 50 attendee roundtables. All the partners and local community members who participate in the event donate their time voluntarily, as the event is a [[not-for-profit]], and there is no entry charge.&lt;ref name="betakit"/&gt;

Each event begins with a keynote speech plus an educational crash course taught by a notable member of the Canadian technology industry. Attendees are then provided with reference materials to assist them in the second phase of the schedule: building a website from scratch.&lt;ref name="globalnews"/&gt; By the end of the seven-hour schedule, it is the conference's goal to have removed the attendees' intimidation associated with programming, and to give them the confidence and resources needed to continue their [[web development]] learning if they choose to do so.&lt;ref name="thelondoner"/&gt;

In business, '''training simulation''' is a virtual medium through which various types of skills can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, C. and Sawyer, J. (1999). ''Exploring the Learning from an Enterprise Simulation, Journal of Management Development''&lt;/ref&gt; Training simulations can be used in a variety of genres; however they are most commonly&lt;ref&gt;Henfrey, Richard (1989). ''"Executive" simulation'', Executive Development, Vol. 3 Iss: 2&lt;/ref&gt; used in corporate situations to improve [[business]] awareness and [[management]] skills. They are also common in academic environments as an integrated part of a business or management course.

The word [[simulation]] implies an imitation of a real-life process, usually via a computer or other technological device, in order to provide a [[lifelike experience]]. This has proven to be a reliable and successful method of training in thousands of industries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Ellet, Bill (1997). ''TMR Shortlist of Business Simulations'', Training Media Review Publications&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used both to allow specialization in a certain area, and to educate individuals in the workings of the sectors as a whole, making training simulations versatile. Training simulations are not just games;&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). ''Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming''. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) ''The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning''&lt;/ref&gt; their aim is to educate and inform in an exciting and memorable way, rather than purely to entertain.

__TOC__

==Purpose==

Companies across the world regularly use simulations as a tool to teach employees.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Elizabeth, O’Loughlin, Andrew and McFadzean, Elspeth (2005). ''[http://www.pogc.ir/portals/0/maghalat/890706-2.pdf Corporate Entrepreneurship and Innovation Part 2: A Role- and Process-based Approach]'', European Journal of Innovation Management, Vol. 8 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; With the enormous range of simulation-based activities available, it is unsurprising that the specific aims of the sessions vary widely. Some simulations are focused on [[decision making|making decisions]] in a particular area of the business, such as personnel or [[product design]], and these are called ''Functional Simulations''. Others give a general overview of a company and give experience of making executive management decisions, and are called ''Total Enterprise Simulations''.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990).'' [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.1754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations].'' In Gentry (ed.) ''Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning''&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, this classification has become somewhat impractical, as increasing numbers of training simulations are involving both elements, and combining both an overall view of the industry with some decisions relating to specific sectors.

Training Simulations normally form part of a program designed to educate employees or students about the skills needed to operate a business, as well as persuade them to "[[think outside the box]]" and see the bigger picture.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Graham A. ''Home and Away: Application of the Executive Simulation for Education and Training Purposes in Dundee and Malaysia''&lt;/ref&gt; This can make for a better organized, more fluid system in which all employees understand their part in making the company successful.


 
Although the most common use for training simulations is in a [[corporate]] setting,&lt;ref&gt;Declan Doyle, F. William Brown, (2000). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Brown/publication/235314940_Using_a_business_simulation_to_teach_applied_skills_-_The_benefits_and_the_challenges_of_using_student_teams_from_multiple_countries/links/0deec52a5e16008bae000000/Using-a-business-simulation-to-teach-applied-skills-The-benefits-and-the-challenges-of-using-student-teams-from-multiple-countries.pdf Using a business simulation to teach applied skills – the benefits and the challenges of using student teams from multiple countries]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 24 Iss: 6&lt;/ref&gt; simulation games are increasingly being used to educate young people about the importance of business. From secondary school age all the way up to [[MBA]] students, anyone can benefit from the first-hand experience of running a company and making decisions that directly affect performance.&lt;ref&gt;Prohaska, Charles R. and Frank, Ellen J. (1990). ''[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1046878190211004 Using Simulations to Investigate Management Decision Making]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 21 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow the participants to gain an overall understanding of the business world, and give some insight into the type of skills that are necessary to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Elgood, Chris (1996). ''Using Management Games''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that ‘beating the game’ should not be a primary aim for anyone taking part in a simulation; the focus should be directed towards everyone gaining some useful and relevant knowledge that they can take away and use in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Michael J. R. and Reddy, Peter (2010). ''[http://eprints.aston.ac.uk/20147/1/Butler__Reddy_JEIT_-_Developing_Critical_Understanding_through_EBL_and_Storytelling.pdf Developing Critical Understanding in HRM Students: Using Innovative Teaching Methods to Encourage Deep Approaches to Study]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 34 Iss: 8/9&lt;/ref&gt; If the simulation does have a competitive element, it is to motivate and inspire, rather than encourage any malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;Hynes, Briga, Costin, Yvonne and Birdthistle, Naomi (2011). ''Practice-based Learning in Entrepreneurship Education: A Means of Connecting Knowledge Producers and Users''. Higher Education, Skills and Work-based Learning, Vol. 1 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt; Some training activities are non-competitive to avoid this, however many noted experts in the field state that the rivalry between teams or individuals improves the learning experience and adds a sense of fun and drama into the simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, D. J. (1997). ''Group Competitiveness and Cohesion in a Business Simulation''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 28 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important when working with young people such as students, as they often require an extra boost to keep them entertained, especially when a simulation is run over an extended period.

==Development==

The concept of training employees to have a wider perspective on their position within the workplace has been around for hundreds of years,&lt;ref&gt;Keys, Bernard and Wolfe, Joseph (1990). ''The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research''. Journal of Management, Vol. 16, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; but it is only relatively recently that the idea of creating a simulated environment for trainees to test their abilities and skills has been developed. The first commercially available training simulation was in 1956, and was called ''The Top Management Decision Game'', and was created by the [[American Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). ''Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the market has expanded hugely, with thousands of simulations available based upon hundreds of different industries. Initially simple with just a few choices to make, some simulations have become extremely complex with many different interlinking decisions. When training simulations were first used, they involved paper forms that were filled in by the participants and then compared by the organizer of the exercise. Nowadays, nearly all simulations are [[computer]] based,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, John M. (2007). ''Business Simulations - Do They Have a Place in Training?''&lt;/ref&gt; and involve multi-stage algorithms that calculate performance based on the decisions entered.&lt;ref&gt;Fripp, John (1997). ''A Future for Business Simulations?'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 21 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Most simulations are based around a real [[industry]], and hence they use real data to be as accurate as possible and to provide a realistic experience. However, some remain generic and do not model a particular industry, although these tend to be more useful for younger players or those with absolutely no business knowledge.

==Integrated==

Most corporations and academic courses that contain a training simulation integrate it into an existing or completely new training programme.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (1987). ''A Survey of the Use of Business Games in Academia and Business''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 18 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to get the maximum value from the experience, as well as review the sessions in order to improve them for future use. The structure of a training session would normally be as follows:

* '''Introduction:''' the organizer of the program (plus sometimes a specialist in the training simulation) will meet the participants and give them a brief explanation of the purposes behind the training and what they should hope to achieve.
* '''Lectures:''' sometimes the trainees will also receive one or more lectures around the topics that the simulation will be based on, in order to give them an idea of the type of skills they will need. This is especially important within academia, when the students will often be examined on this section after the event.
* '''The simulation:''' the simulation will then be played, allowing newly acquired knowledge to be tested and skills practiced. A positive atmosphere is vital here to maintain enthusiasm.
* '''Evaluation:''' once the simulation has been completed, it is important to summarize what has been learnt and the effectiveness of the training. Presenting results to others may provide a means of internal assessment, as well as showcasing the players’ achievements.

This integrated [[training]] will allow everyone taking part in the simulation to get the maximum experience possible, as well as being entertaining, exciting and giving them a new perspective on the business world. Many companies that specialize in training simulations also offer to create a special integrated plan unique to the client,&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler, I (2005). ''[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8bc/e727abf8da27f3dc4497b00499129fd31d78.pdf Development of an asset management strategy for a network utility company: Lessons from a dynamic business simulation approach]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 36 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to make the process as streamlined and efficient as possible.

==Benefits==

Since training simulations are available based on such a wide range of different industries, and with thousands of different aims and objectives, it is difficult to outline a specific skill-set that will be improved by taking part in a training simulation. However, skills that good training simulations should build on include:

* '''Business awareness''' – before participating in the training programme, many players will have little idea of how to run a business or what it involves. Simulations allow them to temporarily have control over a virtual company, to see whether their decisions lead them to success or failure!&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Natalia, Escudero, Anna, Barahona, Juan and Leitao, Fernando (2009). ''[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090590910950578 The Effect of Entrepreneurship Education Programmes on Satisfaction with Innovation, Behaviour and Performance]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 33 Iss: 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Time management and organization''' – most simulations contain timed sessions, which will test the candidates’ skill in submitting decisions within the allotted time slot.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Lynn, Marcia and Sigelman, Lee (1991). ''Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; This is an excellent skill for any employee or graduate.
* '''Team coordination''' – the majority of training simulations involve working in groups or teams of people;&lt;ref&gt;Wellington, W. J. and Faria, A. J. (1992). ''An Examination on the Effect of Team Cohesion, Player Attitude and Performance Expectations on Simulation Performance Results''&lt;/ref&gt; improving the abilities to communicate effectively, delegate tasks and diplomatically resolve any situations.
* '''Problem solving''' – simulations will often present tricky circumstances that must be thought through logically to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (2001). ''[http://www.coulthard.com/library/Files/faria_2001_thechangingnatureofbusinesssimulationgamingresearch.pdf The Changing Nature of Business Simulation/Gaming Research: A Brief History]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 32 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Successful resolution of these shows good management skills.
 
If every participant improves in these four key skill areas, the training programme will be a success, and any business should notice an improvement in efficiency and motivation, and students will be inspired and animated.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Simulation Means Better Senior Managers at Heinz'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 23 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wells Print Shop''' was located at 27 Cuna Street in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. It operated as part of the [[Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board]]'s 18th century museum village, San Agustín Antiguo, demonstrating the colonial printmaking process.&lt;mapframe latitude="29.8949" longitude="-81.3152" zoom="15" width="250" height="200" align="right"&gt;

== William Wells ==
[[William Charles Wells]] was born in 1757 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the son of a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] printer, publisher, and bookseller. He was formally trained as a doctor, receiving a degree in medicine from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1780. When the British left Charleston in 1782, William and his brother John moved to St. Augustine where they established a print shop. In St. Augustine the Wells brothers are most well known for publishing the ''East Florida Gazette'', the first newspaper in Florida. After the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] returned Florida to the Spanish, William Wells went to England and practiced medicine for the rest of his life. He died in London in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1986|title=Two Noteworthy Acquisitions for the WHL in 1985-86|url=|journal=Waring Library Society Newsletter|volume=9|pages=3-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''East Florida Gazette'' ==
The Wells brothers' publication began on February 1, 1783 and lasted a little over one year, with the last issue published on March 22, 1784. London's Public Record Office only contains three issues of the newspaper, those from March 1, May 3, and May 17, 1783. The St. Augustine Historical Society resurrected the name "East Florida Gazette" with its newsletter, which is indexed on the Historical Society Research Library's online catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saintaugustinehistoricalsociety.org/research-library/|title=St. Augustine Historical Society - Research Library|website=www.saintaugustinehistoricalsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Wells Print Shop.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Wells Print Shop, 1971]]
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board reconstructed the Wells Print Shop in 1968 on Cuna Street. The original Wells printing press owned by William and John was located on Treasury Lane. The all-wooden shop was constructed using board-and-[[batten]] building method, which the British settlers in St. Augustine preferred for its quick construction and ease of repair. The building is 220 square feet. 

Inside the print shop was a replica of the type of printing press used towards the end of the 18th century. The press was operated daily to demonstrate the printing process to visitors, but the Preservation Board also used it to make reproductions of historic St. Augustine maps and replicas of the ''East Florida Gazette,'' which were sold as souvenirs. 

Today the site once occupied by the Wells Print Shop operates as a jewelry store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myersjewelryandgifts.com/|title=Myers Jewelry and Gifts|website=www.myersjewelryandgifts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
