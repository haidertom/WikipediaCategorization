Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder  characterized by attempts to lose weight, to the point of [[starvation]]. A person with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a number of signs and symptoms, the type and severity of which may vary and may be present but not readily apparent.&lt;ref name=Surgenor&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Surgenor LJ, Maguire S |title=Assessment of anorexia nervosa: an overview of universal issues and contextual challenges |journal=J Eat Disord |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=29 |year=2013 |pmid=24999408 |pmc=4081667 |doi=10.1186/2050-2974-1-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anorexia nervosa, and the associated [[malnutrition]] that results from self-imposed starvation, can cause [[complication (medicine)|complications]] in every major [[organ system]] in the body.&lt;ref name=Strumia&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strumia R |title=Skin signs in anorexia nervosa |journal=Dermatoendocrinol |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=268–70 |year=2009 |pmid=20808514 |pmc=2836432 |doi=10.4161/derm.1.5.10193}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hypokalaemia]], a drop in the level of [[potassium]] in the blood, is a sign of anorexia nervosa.&lt;ref name=Miller2013&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller KK |title=Endocrine effects of anorexia nervosa |journal=Endocrinol.

* [[Lanugo]]: soft, fine hair growing over the face and body.&lt;ref name=Walsh /&gt;
* An [[fixation (psychology)|obsession]] with counting [[food energy|calories]] and monitoring [[fat]] contents of food.
* Preoccupation with [[food]], [[recipes]], or [[cooking]]; may cook elaborate dinners for others, but not eat the food themselves or consume a very small portion.
* Food restrictions despite being [[underweight]] or at a healthy weight.
* Food rituals, such as cutting food into tiny pieces, refusing to eat around others and hiding or discarding of food.
* Purging: May use [[laxatives]], [[diet pills]], [[ipecac syrup]], or [[water pills]] to flush food out of their system after eating or may engage in self-induced [[vomiting]] though this is a more common symptom of [[bulimia]].

* [[Perception]] of self as overweight, in contradiction to an underweight reality.
* Intolerance to cold and frequent complaints of being cold; body temperature may lower ([[hypothermia]]) in an effort to conserve energy due to [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haller E | title = Eating disorders.

* Dry hair and skin, as well as hair thinning.
* Chronic fatigue.&lt;ref name=Nolen339 /&gt;
* Rapid [[mood swings]].
* Having feet discoloration causing an orange appearance. 
* Having severe [[muscle tension]], aches and pains.
* Evidence/habits of [[self harming]] or self-loathing.
* Admiration of thinner people.

=== Interoceptive ===
 
[[Interoception]] has an important role in [[homeostasis]] and regulation of emotions and motivation. Anorexia has been associated with disturbances to interoception. People with anorexia concentrate on distorted perceptions of their body exterior due to fear of looking overweight.

Some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis may create a food aversion in these persons, causing alterations to their eating patterns. Other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk. It has been documented that some people with celiac disease, [[irritable bowel syndrome]] or [[inflammatory bowel disease]] who are not conscious about the importance of strictly following their diet, choose to consume their trigger foods to promote weight loss. On the other hand, individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety, food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around cross contamination of their foods.&lt;ref name=SatherleyHoward2015 /&gt; Some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder, especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom (such as  decreased appetite, abdominal pain, bloating, distension, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation), weight loss, or growth failure; and also routinely ask celiac patients about  weight or body shape concerns, dieting or vomiting for weight control, to evaluate the possible presence of eating disorders,&lt;ref name=BernOBrien2013 /&gt; especially in women.&lt;ref name=QuickByrdBredbenner2013&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Quick VM, Byrd-Bredbenner C, Neumark-Sztainer D|title= Chronic illness and disordered eating: a discussion of the literature|date=1 May 2013|journal= Adv Nutr|volume=4|issue=3|pages=277–86|doi=10.3945/an.112.003608|pmid=23674793|pmc= 3650496|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anorexia nervosa is more likely to occur in a person's pubertal years. Some explanatory hypotheses for the rising prevalence of eating disorders in adolescence are "increase of adipose tissue in girls, hormonal changes of puberty, societal expectations of increased independence and autonomy that are particularly difficult for anorexic adolescents to meet; [and] increased influence of the peer group and its values." &lt;ref name="Herpertz-Dahlmann, Beate 2013 PMC" /&gt;

=== Media effects ===
Constant exposure to media that presents body ideals may constitute a risk factor for body dissatisfaction and anorexia nervosa. The cultural ideal for body shape for men versus women continues to favor slender women and athletic, V-shaped muscular men.  A 2002 review found that, of the magazines most popular among people aged 18 to 24 years, those read by men, unlike those read by women, were more likely to feature ads and articles on shape than on diet.{{MEDRS|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Labre MP | title = Adolescent boys and the muscular male body ideal | journal = The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 233–42 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11927235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Body dissatisfaction and internalization of body ideals are risk factors for anorexia nervosa that threaten the health of both male and female populations.{{mcn|date=March 2015}}

Websites that stress the importance of attainment of body ideals extol and promote anorexia nervosa through the use of religious metaphors, lifestyle descriptions, "thinspiration" or "fitspiration" (inspirational photo galleries and quotes that aim to serve as motivators for attainment of body ideals).&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norris ML, Boydell KM, Pinhas L, Katzman DK | title = Ana and the Internet: A review of pro-anorexia websites | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 443–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16721839 | doi = 10.1002/eat.20305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pro-anorexia websites reinforce internalization of body ideals and the importance of their attainment.&lt;ref name=Norris /&gt;

The media give men and women a false view of what people truly look like. In magazines, movies and even on billboards most  of the actors/models are digitally altered in multiple ways. People then strive to look like these "perfect" role models when in reality they aren't any where near perfection themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1521/jscp.20.3.289.22303 |title=Ourselves, Our Bodies: Thin-Ideal Media, Self-Discrepancies, and Eating Disorder Symptomatology in Adolescents |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=289–323 |year=2001 |last1=Harrison |first1=Kristen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
Evidence from physiological, pharmacological and neuroimaging studies suggest serotonin may play a role in anorexia.  While acutely ill, metabolic changes may produce a number of biological findings in people with anorexia that are not necessarily causative of the anorexic behavior.  For example, abnormal hormonal responses to challenges with serotonergic agents have been observed during acute illness, but not recovery.  Nevertheless, increased [[cerebrospinal fluid]] concentrations of [[5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (a metabolite of serotonin), and changes in anorectic behavior in response to [[tryptophan]] depletion(a metabolic precursor to serotonin) support a role in anorexia.  The binding potential of [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]] and [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]] have been reportedly decreased and increased respectively in a number of cortical regions.  While these findings may be confounded by comorbid psychiatric disorders, taken as a whole they indicate serotonin in anorexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=WH|last2=Frank|first2=GK|last3=Bailer|first3=UF|last4=Henry|first4=SE|last5=Meltzer|first5=CC|last6=Price|first6=JC|last7=Mathis|first7=CA|last8=Wagner|first8=A|title=Serotonin alterations in anorexia and bulimia nervosa: new insights from imaging studies.|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=19 May 2005|volume=85|issue=1|pages=73–81|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.04.013|pmid=15869768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=WH|last2=Bailer|first2=UF|last3=Frank|first3=GK|last4=Wagner|first4=A|last5=Henry|first5=SE|title=Brain imaging of serotonin after recovery from anorexia and bulimia nervosa.|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=15 September 2005|volume=86|issue=1–2|pages=15–7|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.06.019|pmid=16102788}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These alterations in serotonin have been linked to traits characteristic of anorexia such as obsessiveness, anxiety, and appetite dysregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=W|title=Neurobiology of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=22 April 2008|volume=94|issue=1|pages=121–35|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.11.037|pmid=18164737|pmc=2601682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroimaging studies investigating the functional connectivity between brain regions have observed a number of alterations in networks related to cognitive control, introspection, and sensory function.  Alterations in networks related to the [[anterior cingulate cortex|dorsal anterior cingulate cortex]] may be related to excessive cognitive control of eating related behaviors.  Similarly, altered somatosensory integration and introspection may relate to abnormal body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaudio|first1=S|last2=Wiemerslage|first2=L|last3=Brooks|first3=SJ|last4=Schiöth|first4=HB|title=A systematic review of resting-state functional-MRI studies in anorexia nervosa: Evidence for functional connectivity impairment in cognitive control and visuospatial and body-signal integration.|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=December 2016|volume=71|pages=578–589|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.032|pmid=27725172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of functional neuroimaging studies reported reduced activations in "bottom up" limbic region and increased activations in "top down" cortical regions which may play a role in restrictive eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuglset|first1=TS|last2=Landrø|first2=NI|last3=Reas|first3=DL|last4=Rø|first4=Ø|title=Functional brain alterations in anorexia nervosa: a scoping review.|journal=Journal of eating disorders|date=2016|volume=4|pages=32|doi=10.1186/s40337-016-0118-y|pmid=27933159|pmc=5125031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to controls, recovered anorexics show reduced activation in the [[reward system]] in response to food, and reduced correlation between self reported liking of a sugary drink and activity in the [[striatum]] and ACC.  Increased binding potential of [[raclopride|[11C]raclopride]] in the striatum, interpreted as reflecting decreased endogenous [[dopamine]] due to competitive displacement, has also been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adan|first1=Roger|last2=Kaye|first2=Walter|title=Behavioral Neurobiology of Eating Disorders: 6 (Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences)|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|chapter=Neurocircuitry of Eating Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural neuroimaging studies have found global reductions in both gray matter and white matter, as well as increased cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Regional decreases in the left [[hypothalamus]], left inferior [[parietal lobe]], right [[lentiform nucleus]] and right [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] have also been reported.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Titova|first1=OE|last2=Hjorth|first2=OC|last3=Schiöth|first3=HB|last4=Brooks|first4=SJ|date=9 April 2013|title=Anorexia nervosa is linked to reduced brain structure in reward and somatosensory regions: a meta-analysis of VBM studies.|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=13|pages=110|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-13-110|pmc=3664070|pmid=23570420}}&lt;/ref&gt; in acutely ill patients.

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnostic assessment includes the person's current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms, and family history. The assessment also includes a [[mental state examination]], which is an assessment of the person's current mood and thought content, focusing on views on weight and patterns of eating.

=== DSM-5 ===

Anorexia nervosa is classified under the Feeding and Eating Disorders in the latest revision of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM 5).

Relative to the previous version of the DSM ([[DSM-IV-TR]]), the 2013 revision (DSM5) reflects changes in the criteria for anorexia nervosa, most notably that of the [[amenorrhea]] criterion being removed.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/eating%20disorders%20fact%20sheet.pdf |title=Feeding and eating disorders |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |date=2013 |accessdate=9 April 2015 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501013951/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Eating%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=1 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Estour&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Estour B, Galusca B, Germain N |title=Constitutional thinness and anorexia nervosa: a possible misdiagnosis? |journal=Front Endocrinol (Lausanne) |volume=5 |pages=175 |year=2014 |pmid=25368605 |pmc=4202249 |doi=10.3389/fendo.2014.00175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amenorrhea was removed for several reasons:  it does not apply to males, it is not applicable for females before or after the age of menstruation or taking birth control pills, and some women who meet the other criteria for AN still report some menstrual activity.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

==== Subtypes ====
There are two subtypes of AN:&lt;ref name=Strumia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Peat&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peat C, Mitchell JE, Hoek HW, Wonderlich SA |title=Validity and utility of subtyping anorexia nervosa |journal=Int J Eat Disord |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=590–4 |year=2009 |pmid=19598270 |pmc=2844095 |doi=10.1002/eat.20717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Binge-eating/purging type: the individual utilizes binge eating or displays purging behavior as a means for losing weight.&lt;ref name=Peat /&gt;  It is different from [[bulimia nervosa]] in terms of the individual's weight. An individual with binge-eating/purging type anorexia can maintain a healthy or normal weight, but is usually significantly underweight. People with [[bulimia nervosa]] on the other hand can sometimes be overweight.&lt;ref name=Nolen339 /&gt;
* Restricting type: the individual uses restricting food intake, fasting, diet pills, or exercise as a means for losing weight;&lt;ref name=Strumia /&gt;  they may exercise excessively to keep off weight or prevent weight gain, and some individuals eat only enough to stay alive.&lt;ref name=Strumia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nolen339 /&gt;

==== Levels of severity ====

[[Body mass index]] (BMI) is used by the DSM-5 as an indicator of the level of severity of anorexia nervosa. The DSM-5 states these as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Primary Care, Second Edition: An Interprofessional Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/?id=jJCKBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA826&amp;dq=anorexia+nervosa++body+mass+index++DSM-v+levels+of+severity&amp;q=anorexia%20nervosa%20%20body%20mass%20index%20%20DSM-v%20levels%20of%20severity|publisher = Springer Publishing Company|date = 12 November 2014|access-date = 9 April 2015|isbn = 978-0-8261-7147-4|first = Joanne K.|last = Singleton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Mild: BMI of greater than 17
* Moderate: BMI of 16–16.99
* Severe: BMI of 15–15.99
* Extreme: BMI of less than 15

=== Investigations ===
Medical tests to check for signs of physical deterioration in anorexia nervosa may be performed by a general physician or psychiatrist, including:

* [[Complete Blood Count]] (CBC): a test of the [[white blood cells]], [[red blood cells]] and [[platelets]] used to assess the presence of various disorders such as [[leukocytosis]], [[leukopenia]], [[thrombocytosis]] and [[anemia]] which may result from [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name="Medline Plus"&gt;{{cite web|title=CBC|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003642.htm|publisher=MedlinePlus : U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=31 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525021411/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003642.htm|archivedate=25 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnoses ===
{{Main|Anorexia nervosa (differential diagnoses)}}
A variety of medical and psychological conditions have been misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa; in some cases the correct diagnosis was not made for more than ten years.

The distinction between the diagnoses of anorexia nervosa, [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[eating disorder not otherwise specified]] (EDNOS) is often difficult to make as there is considerable overlap between people diagnosed with these conditions. Seemingly minor changes in people's overall behavior or attitude can change a diagnosis from anorexia: binge-eating type to bulimia nervosa. A main factor differentiating binge-purge anorexia from bulimia is the gap in physical weight. Someone with bulimia nervosa is ordinarily at a healthy weight, or slightly overweight. Someone with binge-purge anorexia is commonly underweight.&lt;ref name=Nolen341&gt;{{cite book|author=Nolen-Hoeksema S|title=Abnormal Psychology |edition= Sixth|year=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-803538-8|page=341 |chapter=Eating disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with the binge-purging subtype of AN may be significantly underweight and typically do not binge-eat large amounts of food, yet they purge the small amount of food they eat.&lt;ref name=Nolen341 /&gt; In contrast, those with bulimia nervosa tend to be at normal weight or overweight and binge large amounts of food.&lt;ref name=Nolen341 /&gt; It is not unusual for a person with an eating disorder to "move through" various diagnoses as their behavior and beliefs change over time.&lt;ref name=Zucker1 /&gt;

== Treatment ==
There is no conclusive evidence that any particular treatment for anorexia nervosa works better than others; however, there is enough evidence to suggest that early intervention and treatment are more effective.&lt;ref name=LockFitzpatrick2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lock JD, Fitzpatrick KK |title=Anorexia nervosa |journal=BMJ Clin Evid |volume=2009 |year=2009 |pmid=19445758 |pmc=2907776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for anorexia nervosa tries to address three main areas.
* Restoring the person to a healthy weight;
* Treating the psychological disorders related to the illness;
* Reducing or eliminating behaviours or thoughts that originally led to the disordered eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=National Institute of Mental Health |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders/index.shtml |title=Eating disorders |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323185427/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders/index.shtml |archivedate=23 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although restoring the person's weight is the primary task at hand, optimal treatment also includes and monitors behavioral change in the individual as well.&lt;ref&gt;National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (2004). Eating Disorders:  Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders. London, The British Psychological Society and The Royal College of Psychiatrists.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that hospitalisation might adversely affect long term outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gowers S. G. | year = 2000 | title = Impact of hospitalisation on the outcome of adolescent anorexia nervosa | url = | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 176 | issue = 2| pages = 138–141 | doi=10.1192/bjp.176.2.138|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychotherapy]] for individuals with AN is challenging as they may value being thin and may seek to maintain control and resist change.&lt;ref name=Nolen357&gt;{{cite book|author=Nolen-Hoeksema, S|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-1-259-06072-4|page=357|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies demonstrate that family based therapy in adolescents with AN is superior to individual therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Blessitt, E., et al. (2015). "Family therapy for adolescent anorexia nervosa." Curr Opin Psychiatry 28(6): 455–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of people with AN is difficult because they are afraid of gaining weight. Initially developing a desire to change may be important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3gmogQshI_MC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=therapy+for+anorexia+nervosa|title=Handbook of Treatment for Eating Disorders|last=Garner|first=David M.|last2=Garfinkel|first2=Paul E.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-57230-186-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet ===
Diet is the most essential factor to work on in people with anorexia nervosa, and must be tailored to each person's needs. Food variety is important when establishing meal plans as well as foods that are higher in energy density.&lt;ref name="nutrition"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Whitnet E, Rolfes SR |year=2011 |title=Understanding Nutrition |location=United States |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |isbn=1-133-58752-6 |page=255 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQgLAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=SA8-PA19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124102125/https://books.google.com/books?id=OQgLAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=SA8-PA19 |archivedate=24 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; People must consume adequate calories, starting slowly, and increasing at a measured pace.&lt;ref name=Marzola /&gt; Evidence of a role for [[zinc]] supplementation during refeeding is unclear.&lt;ref name=NICE2004 /&gt;

=== Therapy ===

=== Nutrition ===
The rate of refeeding can be difficult to establish, because the fear of [[refeeding syndrome]] ([[Refeeding syndrome|RFS]]) can lead to underfeeding.  It is thought that RFS, with falling phosphate and potassium levels,  is more likely to occur when BMI is very low, and when medical comorbidities such as infection or cardiac failure, are present.  In those circumstances, it is recommended to start refeeding slowly but to build up rapidly as long as RFS does not occur.  Recommendations on energy requirements vary, from 5–10 kcal/kg/day in the most medically compromised patients, who appear to have the highest risk of RFS to 1900 kcal/day&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, G. and D.

[[Alexithymia]] influences treatment outcome.&lt;ref name=Pinna /&gt; Recovery is also viewed on a spectrum rather than black and white. According to the Morgan-Russell criteria, individuals can have a good, intermediate, or poor outcome. Even when a person is classified as having a "good" outcome, weight only has to be within 15% of average, and normal menstruation must be present in females. The good outcome also excludes psychological health. Recovery for people with anorexia nervosa is undeniably positive, but recovery does not mean a return to normal.{{mcn|date=March 2015}}

=== Complications ===
Anorexia nervosa can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation, or the attainment of peak bone mass.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} Complications specific to adolescents and children with anorexia nervosa can include the following:
Growth retardation may occur, as height gain may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as [[hypogonadism]] may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing [[adipose tissue]] levels compared to premorbid levels.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.&lt;ref name="CG9FullGuideline"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health |year=2004 |title=Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327055429/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anorexia nervosa causes alterations in the female reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a [[secondary amenorrhea|cessation of menstruation]] in women who are past puberty. In patients with anorexia nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of [[gonadotropin releasing hormone]] in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation.&lt;ref name="pmid18574232"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vyver E, Steinegger C, Katzman DK |title=Eating disorders and menstrual dysfunction in adolescents |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=1135 |issue= |pages=253–64 |year=2008 |pmid=18574232 |doi=10.1196/annals.1429.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotrophins in people with anorexia nervosa has been documented.&lt;ref name="pmid2500676"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Devlin MJ, Walsh BT, Katz JL, Roose SP, Linkie DM, Wright L, Vande Wiele R, Glassman AH |title=Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function in anorexia nervosa and bulimia |journal=Psychiatry Res |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=11–24 |year=1989 |pmid=2500676 |doi= 10.1016/0165-1781(89)90193-5|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, [[growth hormone]] (GH) levels are high, but levels of [[IGF-1]], the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of “resistance” to GH due to chronic starvation.&lt;ref name="pmid17389700"/&gt; IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in anorexia nervosa contribute to a loss of [[bone density]] and potentially contribute to [[osteopenia]] or [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid17389700"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Støving RK, Chen JW, Glintborg D, Brixen K, Flyvbjerg A, Hørder K, Frystyk J |title=Bioactive insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and IGF-binding protein-1 in anorexia nervosa |journal=J.

Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of anorexia nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low bone mass may be permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Anorexia nervosa and bone|url = http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/221/3/R163|journal = Journal of Endocrinology|date = 1 June 2014|issn = 0022-0795|pmc = 4047520|pmid = 24898127|pages = R163–R176|volume = 221|issue = 3|doi = 10.1530/JOE-14-0039|first = Madhusmita|last = Misra|first2 = Anne|last2 = Klibanski|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160617041601/http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/221/3/R163|archivedate = 17 June 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepatic steatosis, or fatty infiltration of the liver, can also occur, and is an indicator of malnutrition in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Walker's Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease|url = https://books.google.com/?id=bG3nVUqIbegC&amp;pg=PA1105&amp;dq=hepatic+steatosis+malnutrition+children&amp;q=hepatic%20steatosis%20malnutrition%20children|publisher = PMPH-USA|date = 1 April 2008|access-date = 9 April 2015|isbn = 978-1-55009-364-3|author= Kleinman R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurological disorders that may occur as complications include [[seizure]]s and [[tremor]]s. [[Wernicke encephalopathy]], which results from [[vitamin B1 deficiency]], has been reported in patients who are extremely malnourished; symptoms include confusion, [[ophthalmoparesis|problems with the muscles responsible for eye movements]] and [[ataxia|abnormalities in walking gait]].

The most common gastrointestinal complications of anorexia nervosa are [[Gastroparesis|delayed stomach emptying]] and [[constipation]], but also include elevated [[liver function tests]], [[diarrhea]], [[acute pancreatitis]], [[gastroesophageal reflux disease|heartburn]], [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], and, rarely, [[superior mesenteric artery syndrome]].&lt;ref name="pmid26407541"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norris ML, Harrison ME, Isserlin L, Robinson A, Feder S, Sampson M |title=Gastrointestinal complications associated with anorexia nervosa: A systematic review |journal=Int J Eat Disord |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=216–37 |year=2016 |pmid=26407541 |doi=10.1002/eat.22462 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed stomach emptying, or gastroparesis, often develops following food restriction and weight loss; the most common symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension, and often occurs after eating. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety, fullness, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms may inhibit efforts at eating and recovery, but can be managed by limiting high-fiber foods, using liquid nutritional supplements, or using [[metoclopramide]] to increase emptying of food from the stomach.&lt;ref name="pmid26407541"/&gt; Gastroparesis generally resolves when weight is regained.

====Cardiac complications====
Anorexia nervosa increases the risk of [[sudden cardiac death]], though the precise cause is unknown. Cardiac complications include structural and functional changes to the heart.&lt;ref name="pmid26710932"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sachs KV, Harnke B, Mehler PS, Krantz MJ |title=Cardiovascular complications of anorexia nervosa: A systematic review |journal=Int J Eat Disord |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=238–48 |year=2016 |pmid=26710932 |doi=10.1002/eat.22481 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these cardiovascular changes are mild and are reversible with treatment, while others may be life-threatening. Cardiac complications can include [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]], [[bradycardia|abnormally slow heart beat]], [[low blood pressure]], decreased size of the heart muscle, reduced heart volume, [[mitral valve prolapse]], [[myocardial fibrosis]], and [[pericardial effusion]].&lt;ref name="pmid26710932"/&gt;

Abnormalities in conduction and repolarization of the heart that can result from anorexia nervosa include [[QT prolongation]], increased [[QT interval|QT dispersion]], conduction delays,  and [[junctional escape rhythms]].&lt;ref name="pmid26710932"/&gt; Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly [[hypokalemia]] and [[hypomagnesemia]], can cause anomalies in the electrical activity of the heart, and result in life-threatening arrhythmias. Hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common, and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension, a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position, may also occur. Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]] or near-fainting.&lt;ref name="pmid26710932"/&gt; Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization.&lt;ref name="pmid26710932"/&gt;  Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes [[atrophy]] of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased [[cardiac output|ability to pump blood]], a reduction in the ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue.&lt;ref name="pmid3335466"/&gt;

Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size over weeks to months, with recovery.&lt;ref name="pmid3335466"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldberg SJ, Comerci GD, Feldman L |title=Cardiac output and regional myocardial contraction in anorexia nervosa |journal=J Adolesc Health Care |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=15–21 |year=1988 |pmid=3335466 |doi= 10.1016/0197-0070(88)90013-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atrophy of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]] is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.&lt;ref name="pmid26710932"/&gt; Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or [[palpitations]]; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the [[mitral valve]] remains the same size. Studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa, while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2–4 percent.&lt;ref name="pmid3460535"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson GL, Humphries LL, Shirley PB, Mazzoleni A, Noonan JA |title=Mitral valve prolapse in patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=146 |issue=8 |pages=1525–9 |year=1986 |pmid=3460535 |doi= 10.1001/archinte.1986.00360200083014|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that there is an association between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death, but it has not been proven to be causative, either in patients with anorexia nervosa or in the general population.&lt;ref name="pmid26710932"/&gt;

=== Relapse ===
Relapse occurs in approximately a third of people in hospital, and is greatest in the first six to eighteen months after release from an institution.&lt;ref name=Hasan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasan TF, Hasan H |title=Anorexia nervosa: a unified neurological perspective |journal=Int J Med Sci |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=679–703 |year=2011 |pmid=22135615 |pmc=3204438 |doi=10.7150/ijms.8.679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Anorexia is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries at some point in their life.&lt;ref name="Sm2012" /&gt; About 0.4% of young females are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur three to ten times less commonly in males.&lt;ref name=DSM5book /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sm2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hasan /&gt; Rates in most of the developing world are unclear.&lt;ref name=DSM5book /&gt; Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;

The lifetime rate of atypical anorexia nervosa, a form of [[ED-NOS]] in which not all of the diagnostic criteria for AN are met, is much higher, at 5–12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zanetti T|chapter=Epidemiology of Eating Disorders|title=Eating Disorders and the Skin|year=2013|pages=9–15|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-29136-4_2|isbn=978-3-642-29135-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Attia2010 /&gt; Most studies show that since at least 1970 the incidence of AN in adult women is fairly constant, while there is some indication that the incidence may have been increasing for girls aged between 14 and 20.&lt;ref name="Hoek2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smink FR, van Hoeken D, Hoek HW | title = Epidemiology of Eating Disorders: Incidence, Prevalence and Mortality Rates | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–414 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22644309 | pmc = 3409365 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-012-0282-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to researcher [[Ben Radford]] who wrote in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' "I found many examples of flawed, misleading, and sometimes completely wrong information and data being copied and widely disseminated among eating disorder organizations and educators without anyone bothering to consult the original research to verify its accuracy". Radford states that misleading statistics and data have been ignored by organizations like the National Eating Disorder Association who has not released data for "incidence of anorexia from 1984–2017" he states that each agency continues to report incorrect numbers assuming that someone else has checked the accuracy.&lt;ref name="Radford 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radford |first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford |title=Medical Misinformation in the Media: Is Anorexia on the Rise? |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=46–49 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underrepresentation ===
Eating disorders are less reported in preindustrial, non-westernized countries than in Western countries. In Africa, not including South Africa, the only data presenting information about eating disorders occurs in case reports and isolated studies, not studies investigating prevalence. Data shows in research that in westernized civilizations, ethnic minorities have very similar rates of eating disorders, contrary to the belief that eating disorders predominantly occur in Caucasian people.{{mcn|date=March 2015}}

Men (and women) who might otherwise be diagnosed with anorexia may not meet the [[DSM IV]]  criteria for [[Body mass index|BMI]] since they have muscle weight, but have very little fat.&lt;ref name=Bonci&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonci CM, Bonci LJ, Granger LR, Johnson CL, Malina RM, Milne LW, Ryan RR, Vanderbunt EM | title = National athletic trainers' association position statement: Preventing, detecting, and managing disordered eating in athletes | journal = Journal of Athletic Training | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–108 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18335017 | pmc = 2231403 | doi = 10.4085/1062-6050-43.1.80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Men and women athletes are often overlooked as anorexic.&lt;ref name=Bonci /&gt; Research emphasizes the importance to take athletes' diet, weight and symptoms into account when diagnosing anorexia,  instead of just looking at weight and BMI.

The term ''anorexia nervosa'' was coined in 1873 by [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], one of [[Queen Victoria]]'s personal physicians.&lt;ref name="pmid9385628"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gull WW | title = Anorexia nervosa (apepsia hysterica, anorexia hysterica). 1868 | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 498–502 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9385628 | doi = 10.1002/j.1550-8528.1997.tb00677.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of anorexia nervosa begins with descriptions of religious fasting dating from the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic era]]&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pearce JM | title = Richard Morton: Origins of Anorexia nervosa | journal = European Neurology | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 191–192 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15539770 | doi = 10.1159/000082033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing into the medieval period. The medieval practice of self-starvation by women, including some young women, in the name of religious piety and purity also concerns anorexia nervosa; it is sometimes referred to as ''[[anorexia mirabilis]].''&lt;ref name=Espi&gt;{{cite journal |author=Espi Forcen F |title=Anorexia mirabilis: the practice of fasting by Saint Catherine of Siena in the late Middle Ages |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=170 |issue=4 |pages=370–1 |year=2013 |pmid=23545792 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12111457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harris JC |title=Anorexia nervosa and anorexia mirabilis: Miss K.

The earliest medical descriptions of anorexic illnesses are generally credited to English physician [[Richard Morton (physician)|Richard Morton]] in 1689.&lt;ref name=Pearce /&gt; Case descriptions fitting anorexic illnesses continued throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland 1894 309"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gull, Sir William Withey|editor=T D Acland |year=1894|page= 309|title=Medical Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century anorexia nervosa became widely accepted by the medical profession as a recognized condition. In 1873, [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], one of Queen Victoria's personal physicians, published a seminal paper which coined the term ''anorexia nervosa'' and provided a number of detailed case descriptions and treatments.&lt;ref name="Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland 1894 309" /&gt; In the same year, French physician [[Charles Lasègue|Ernest-Charles Lasègue]] similarly published details of a number of cases in a paper entitled ''De l'Anorexie hystérique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lasègue E|title=On Hysterical Anorexia|publisher=Medical Times and Gazette|date=6 September 1873}} See also {{PMID|9385627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awareness of the condition was largely limited to the medical profession until the latter part of the 20th century, when German-American psychoanalyst [[Hilde Bruch]] published ''The Golden Cage: the Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa'' in 1978.  Despite major advances in neuroscience,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Arnold, Carrie (2012) ''Decoding Anorexia: How Breakthroughs in Science Offer Hope for Eating Disorders'', Routledge Press. {{ISBN|0-415-89867-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruch's theories tend to dominate popular thinking. A further important event was the death of the popular singer and drummer [[Karen Carpenter]] in 1983, which prompted widespread ongoing media coverage of eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Arnold, Carrie|title=Anorexia: you don't just grow out of it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/anorexia-you-dont-just-grow-out-of-it|accessdate=29 March 2016|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=29 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329055732/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/anorexia-you-dont-just-grow-out-of-it|archivedate=29 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
The term is of Greek origin: ''an-'' (ἀν-, prefix denoting negation) and ''orexis'' (ὄρεξις, "appetite"), translating literally to a nervous loss of appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klein DA, Walsh BT |title=Eating disorders: clinical features and pathophysiology |journal=Physiol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">'''Area studies''' (also '''regional studies''') are [[interdisciplinary]] fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular [[geography|geographical]], [[nation]]al/[[Federal government|federal]], or [[culture|cultural]] regions.  The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. Typical area study programs involve [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[languages]], [[geography]], [[literature]], and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include [[diaspora]] and [[emigration]] from the area.

==History==
[[Interdisciplinary]] area studies became increasingly common in the [[United States of America]] and in Western scholarship after World War II. Before that war American universities had just a few faculty who taught or conducted research on the non-Western world. Foreign-area studies were virtually nonexistent. After the war, liberals and conservatives alike were concerned about the U.S. ability to respond effectively to perceived external threats from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] in the context of the emerging [[Cold War]], as well as to the fall-out from the [[Decolonisation of Africa|Decolonization of Africa]] and [[decolonisation of Asia|Asia]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

{{Double image|right|Diploma_de_Especialista_Universitario_de_la_Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid.jpg|200px|Diploma-licenciatura-estudos-europeus-universidade.jpg|200px|[[Latin American studies]] and [[European studies]] are examples of Area studies, offered both in [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] degrees, the images show examples from [[Complutense University of Madrid]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucm.es/amelat/interes&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universidade Aberta|Aberta University]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uab.pt/guiainformativo/eng_detailcursos.php?curso=14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this context, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] convened a series of meetings producing a broad consensus that to address this knowledge deficit, the U.S. must invest in international studies. Therefore, the foundations of the field are strongly rooted in America.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  Participants argued that a large brain trust of internationally oriented [[political scientist]]s and [[economist]]s was an urgent national priority. There was a central tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought social scientists should seek to develop overarching [[macrohistory | macrohistorial]] theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area-studies advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

The [[Ford Foundation]] would eventually become the dominant player in shaping the area-studies program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, ''The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the foundation established the prestigious Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP), the first large-scale national competition in support of area-studies training in the United States. From 1953 to 1966 it contributed $270 million to 34 universities for area and language studies. Also during this period, it poured millions of dollars into the committees run jointly by the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] for field-development workshops, conferences, and publication programs.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Szanton, "The Origin, Nature and Challenges of Area Studies in the United States," in ''The Politics of Knowledge: Area Studies and the Disciplines'', ed. David L. Szanton (University of California Press, 2004), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the SSRC-ACLS joint committees would take over the administration of FAFP.

Other large and important programs followed Ford's. Most notably, the [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1957, renamed the Higher Education Act in 1965, allocated funding for some 125 university-based area-studies units known as [[National Resource Center]] programs at U.S. universities, as well as for [[Foreign Language and Area Studies]] fellowships for graduate students.

Meanwhile, area studies were also developed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy within the field==
Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the [[CIA]], the [[FBI]], and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there is the notion that U.S concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of area studies.&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick O'Meara, "Changing perspectives on international education", (Indiana University Press 2010), pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, area studies began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. 2009. “Area Studies in a Global Context.” Chronicle of Higher Education. Nov 29. http://chronicle.com/article/Area-Studies-in-a-Global-Co/49284/&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, one of the greatest threats to the area studies project was the rise of [[rational choice theory]] in political science and economics.&lt;ref&gt;See "Rational Choice Theory," by John Scott, in ''Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of The Present'', edited by G. Browning, A. Halcli, and F. Webster (Sage Publications, 2000). {{cite web|url=http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227085005/http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; To mock one of the most outspoken rational choice theory critics, Japan scholar [[Chalmers Johnson]] asked: Why do you need to know Japanese or anything about Japan's history and culture if the methods of rational choice will explain why Japanese politicians and bureaucrats do the things they do?&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers Johnson and E. B. Keehn, "A Disaster in the Making: Rational Choice and Asian Studies," ''The National Interest'' 36 (summer 1994), pp. 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], philanthropic foundations and scientific bureaucracies moved to attenuate their support for area studies, emphasizing instead interregional themes like "development and democracy". When the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], which had long served as the national [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for raising and administering funds for area studies, underwent their first major restructuring in thirty years, closing down their area committees, scholars interpreted this as a massive signal about the changing research environment.&lt;ref&gt;See Cumings article, cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an increasing interest in studying translocal, transregional, transnational and transcontinental phenomena, a Potsdam-based research network has recently coined the term "TransArea Studies" [http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/ (POINTS – Potsdam International Network for TransArea Studies)].

Other interdisciplinary research fields such as [[women's studies]] (also known as [[gender studies]]), [[disability studies]], and [[ethnic studies]] (including [[African American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[Latino/a studies]], and [[Native American studies]]) are not part of '''area studies''' but are sometimes included in discussion along with it.

==Institutions==

Some entire institutions of higher education (tertiary education) are devoted solely to area studies such as [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], part of the [[University of London]], or the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] in Japan. At the [[University of Oxford]], the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS)[http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/][http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/ School of Interdiscplinary Area Studies, Oxford] and [[St Antony's College]] specialise in area studies, and hosts a number of post-graduate teaching programmes and research centres covering various regions of the world.
[[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi, is the only institution with immense contribution towards popularising area studies in India.
An institution which exclusively deals with Area Studies is the [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|GIGA]] (German Institute of Global Area Studies) in Germany.  Additionally, [[Lund University]] in Sweden offers the largest [http://www.ace.lu.se/ Asian Studies] masters program in Northern Europe and is dedicated to promoting studies related to South Asia through its [http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ SASNet].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund|title=Study Asia in Lund!|author=|date=27 June 2017|website=lu.se|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder''' ('''ARFID'''), previously known as '''selective eating disorder''' ('''SED'''), is a type of [[eating disorder]], where certain foods are limited based on appearance, smell, taste, texture, brand, presentation, or a past negative experience with the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Martin M.|last2=Rosen|first2=David S.|last3=Ornstein|first3=Rollyn M.|last4=Mammel|first4=Kathleen A.|last5=Katzman|first5=Debra K.|last6=Rome|first6=Ellen S.|last7=Callahan|first7=S.

== Signs and symptoms ==
People with ARFID have an inability to eat certain foods. "Safe" foods may be limited to certain food types and even specific brands.  In some cases, individuals with the condition will exclude whole food groups, such as fruits or vegetables. Sometimes excluded foods can be refused based on color. Some may only like very hot or very cold foods, very crunchy or hard-to-chew foods, or very soft foods, or avoid sauces.

Most people with ARFID will still maintain a healthy or typical body weight.  There are no specific outward appearances associated with ARFID.&lt;ref name="nicholls"&gt;Nicholls, D., Christie, D., Randall, L. and Lask, B.. (2001). "Selective Eating: Symptom, Disorder or Normal Variant." Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry. Vol 6(2): 257–270.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers can experience physical [[gastrointestinal]] reactions to adverse foods such as retching, vomiting or gagging. Some studies have identified symptoms of social avoidance due to their eating habits. Most, however, would change their eating habits if they could.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt;

The determination of the cause of ARFID has been difficult due to the lack of diagnostic criteria and concrete definition. However, many have proposed other conditions that co-occur with ARFID.

There are different kinds of 'sub-categories' identified for ARFID:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sensory-based avoidance, where the individual refuses food intake based on smell, texture, color, brand, presentation
* A lack of interest in consuming the food, or tolerating it nearby
* Food being associated with fear-evoking stimuli that have developed through a learned history

=== Autism ===
Symptoms of ARFID are usually found with symptoms of other disorders. Some form of feeding disorder is found in 80% of children that also have a developmental disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chatoor | first1 = I. | last2 = Hamburger | first2 = E. | last3 = Fullard | first3 = R. | last4 = Fivera | first4 = Y. | year = 1994 | title = A survey of picky eating and pica behaviors in toddlers | url = | journal = Scientific Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children often exhibit symptoms of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[autism]]. Although many people with ARFID have symptoms of these disorders, they usually do not qualify for a full diagnosis. Strict behavior patterns and difficulty adjusting to new things are common symptoms in patients that are on the [[Autism Spectrum Disorder|autistic spectrum]].&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt; A study done by Schreck at [[Pennsylvania State University]] compared the eating habits of children with [[Autism Spectrum Disorder|ASD]] and typically developing children. After analyzing their eating patterns, they suggested that the children with some degree of ASD have a higher degree of selective eating. These children were found to have similar patterns of selective eating and favored more energy dense foods such as nuts and whole grains. Eating a diet of energy dense foods could put these children at a greater risk for health problems such as obesity and other chronic diseases due to the high fat and low fiber content of energy dense foods. Due to the tie to ASD, children are less likely to outgrow their selective eating behaviors and most likely should meet with a clinician to address their eating issues.&lt;ref&gt;Schreck KA, Williams K, Smith AF. A comparison of eating behaviors between children with and without Autism" ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disabilities'' 2004; 34: 433-438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, E. (2013).

=== Anxiety disorder ===
Specific food avoidances could be caused by food phobias that cause great [[anxiety]] when a person is presented with new or feared foods. Most eating disorders are related to a fear of gaining weight. Those who have ARFID do not have this fear, but the psychological symptoms and anxiety created is similar.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt; Some people with ARFID have fears such as [[emetophobia]] (fear of vomiting) or a fear of choking, but this is not common.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is often based on a diagnostic checklist to test whether an individual is exhibiting certain behaviors and characteristics. Clinicians will look at the variety of foods an individual consumes, as well as the portion size of accepted foods. They will also question how long the avoidance or refusal of particular foods has lasted, and if there are any associated medical concerns, such as malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Unlike most eating disorders, there may be a higher rate of ARFID in young boys than there is in young girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/|title=Eating Disorder Statistics • National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders|work=National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criteria ===
The fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) renamed "Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood" to Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, and broadened the diagnostic criteria. Previously defined as a disorder exclusive to children and adolescents, the DSM-5 broadened the disorder to include adults who limit their eating and are affected by related physiological or psychological problems, but who do not fall under the definition of another eating disorder.

The DSM-5 defines the following diagnostic criteria:&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5. Retrieved May 14, 2014, from {{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disturbance in eating or feeding, as evidenced by one or more of:
** Substantial weight loss (or, in children, absence of expected weight gain)
** Nutritional deficiency
** Dependence on a [[feeding tube]] or [[dietary supplements]]
** Significant [[psychosocial]] interference
* Disturbance not due to unavailability of food, or to observation of cultural norms
* Disturbance not due to [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], and no evidence of disturbance in experience of body shape or weight
* Disturbance not better explained by another medical condition or mental disorder, or when occurring concurrently with another condition, the disturbance exceeds what is normally caused by that condition
In previous years, the DSM was not inclusive in recognizing all of the challenges associated with feeding and eating disorders in 3 main domains:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant-Waugh|first=R|year=2013|title=Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder: An illustrative case example|url=|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume=46|pages=420–423|via=|doi=10.1002/eat.22093}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) was an all-inclusive, placeholder group for all individuals that presented challenges with feeding
* The category of Feeding Disorder of Infancy/ Early Childhood was noted to be too broad, limiting specification when treating these behaviors
* There are children and youth who present feeding challenges but do not fit within any existing categories to date

Children are often picky eaters, this does not necessarily mean they meet the criteria for an ARFID diagnosis. In addition, self-identification as having ARFID may contribute to the condition.

== Treatment ==

=== For adults ===
With time the symptoms of ARFID can lessen and can eventually disappear without treatment. However, in some cases treatment will be needed as the symptoms persist into adulthood. The most common type of treatment for ARFID is some form of [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]]. Working with a clinician can help to change behaviors more quickly than symptoms may typically disappear without treatment.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt; 

There are support groups for adults with ARFID.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;Wang, S. (2010, July 5). No Age Limit on Picky Eating. Wall Street Journal. Retrieved April 2, 2013, from https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704699604575343130457388718&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For children ===
Children can benefit from a four stage in-home treatment program based on the principles of [[systematic desensitization]]. The four stages of the treatment are record, reward, relax and review.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt;

* In the record stage, children are encouraged to keep a log of their typical eating behaviors without attempting to change their habits as well as their [[cognitive]] feelings.
* The reward stage involves systematic desensitization. Children create a list of foods that they might like to try eating some day. These foods may not be drastically different from their normal diet, but perhaps a familiar food prepared in a different way. Because the goal is for the children to try new foods, children are rewarded when they sample new foods.
*The relaxation stage is most important for those children that suffer severe anxiety when presented with unfavorable foods. Children learn to relax to reduce the anxiety that they feel. Children work through a list of anxiety-producing stimuli and can create a story line with relaxing imagery and scenarios. Often these stories can also include the introduction of new foods with the help of a real person or fantasy person. Children then listen to this story before eating new foods as a way to imagine themselves participating in an expanded variety of foods while relaxed.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt;
* The final stage, review, is important to keep track of the child's progress. It is important to include both one-on-one sessions with the child, as well as with the parent in order to get a clear picture of how the child is progressing and if the relaxation techniques are working.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6942">The '''Bennett scale''', also called the '''Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity''' ('''DMIS'''), was developed by [[Milton Bennett]]. The framework describes the different ways in which people can react to [[cultural difference]]s.

Organized into six “stages” of increasing sensitivity to difference, the DMIS identifies the underlying cognitive orientations individuals use to understand cultural difference. Each position along the continuum represents increasingly complex perceptual organizations of cultural difference, which in turn allow increasingly sophisticated experiences of other cultures.  By identifying the underlying experience of cultural difference, predictions about behavior and attitudes can be made and education can be tailored to facilitate development along the continuum.  The first three stages are [[ethnocentric]] as one sees his own [[culture]] as central to reality. Climbing the scale, one develops a more and more ethnorelative point of view, meaning that one experiences one's own culture as in the context of other cultures.
By the fourth stage, ethnocentric views are replaced by ethnorelative views.

== Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity ==
# '''Denial of Difference'''
#* Individuals experience their own culture as the only “real” one.  Other cultures are either not noticed at all or are understood in an undifferentiated, simplistic manner.  People at this position are generally uninterested in cultural difference, but when confronted with difference their seemingly benign acceptance may change to aggressive attempts to avoid or eliminate it. Most of the time, this is a result of physical or social isolation, where the person's views are never challenged and are at the center of their reality.
# '''Defense against Difference'''
#* One’s own culture is experienced as the most “evolved” or best way to live. This position is characterized by dualistic us/them thinking and frequently accompanied by overt negative stereotyping. They will openly belittle the differences among their culture and another, denigrating race, gender or any other indicator of difference. People at this position are more openly threatened by cultural difference and more likely to be acting aggressively against it.  A variation at this position is seen in reversal where one’s own culture is devalued and another culture is romanticized as superior.&lt;ref&gt;While this level may initially be interpreted as a higher level of sensitivity, it is actually consistent with the dualistic thinking characterized by this stage where one culture is seen as good and another culture as bad.  In this case, however, it is one’s own culture that is seen as bad and another’s culture that is seen as good; neither culture is valued in its own right.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Minimization of Difference''' 
#* The experience of similarity outweighs the experience of difference. People recognize superficial cultural differences in food, customs, etc.,. but they emphasize human similarity in physical structure, psychological needs, and/or assumed adherence to universal values. People at this position are likely to assume that they are no longer ethnocentric, and they tend to overestimate their tolerance while underestimating the effect (e.g. “privilege”) of their own culture. In other words, as explained by the Canadian Center for Intercultural Learning, “people who adopt this point of view generally approach intercultural situations with the assurance that a simple awareness of the fundamental patterns of human interaction will be sufficient to assure the success of the communication. Such a viewpoint is ethnocentric because it presupposes that the fundamental categories of behavior are absolute and that these categories are in fact our own."
# '''Acceptance of Difference'''
#* One’s own culture is experienced as one of a number of equally complex worldviews. People at this position accept the existence of culturally different ways of organizing human existence, although they do not necessarily like or agree with every way.  They can identify how culture affects a wide range of human experience and they have a framework for organizing observations of cultural difference. We recognize people from this stage through their eager questioning of others. This reflects a real desire to be informed, and not to confirm prejudices. The key words of this stage are “getting to know” or “learning.”
# '''Adaptation to Difference'''
#* Individuals are able to expand their own worldviews to accurately understand other cultures and behave in a variety of culturally appropriate ways.  Effective use of empathy, or frame of reference shifting, to understand and be understood across cultural boundaries. It is the ability to act properly outside of one’s own culture. At this stage, one is able to “walk the talk.”
# '''Integration of Difference'''
#* One’s experience of self is expanded to include the movement in and out of different cultural worldviews.  People at this position have a definition of self that is “marginal” (not central) to any particular culture, allowing this individual to shift rather smoothly from one cultural worldview to another.

==Evolutionary strategies==
In his theory, Bennett describes what changes occur when evolving through each step of the scale. Summarized, they are the following: 
# '''From Denial to Defense''': the person acquires an awareness of difference between cultures
# '''From Defense to Minimization''': negative judgments are depolarized, and the person is introduced to similarities between cultures.
# '''From Minimization to Acceptance''': the subject grasps the importance of intercultural difference.
# '''From Acceptance to Adaptation''': exploration and research into the other culture begins
# '''From Adaptation to Integration''': subject develops empathy towards the other culture.

Animals that are held by humans and prevented from escaping are said to be in '''captivity'''.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions, 1911 CHAPTER 27 1 and 2 Geo 5; "...the expression “captive animal” means any animal (not being a domestic animal) of whatsoever kind or species, and whether a quadruped or not, including any bird, fish, or reptile, which is in captivity, or confinement, or which is maimed, pinioned, or subjected to any appliance or contrivance for the purpose of hindering or preventing its escape from captivity or confinement..."; Protection of Animals Act 1911; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/27&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually applied to wild animals that are held in confinement, but may also be used generally to describe the keeping of [[domesticate]]d [[animal]]s such as [[livestock]] or [[pet]]s. This may include, for example, animals in [[farm]]s, private homes, [[zoo]]s and laboratories. Animal captivity may be categorized according to the particular motives, objectives and conditions of the confinement.

==History==

Throughout history not only domestic animals as pets and [[livestock]] were kept in captivity and under human care, but also wild animals. Some were failed domestication attempts. Also, in past times, primarily the wealthy, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and kings collected wild animals for various reasons. Contrary to domestication, the ferociousness and natural behaviour of the wild animals were preserved and exhibited. Today's zoos claim other reasons for keeping animals under human care: [[conservation biology|conservation]], [[education]] and [[science]].

[[Image:Mexican wolf lounging.jpg|right|thumb|An [[endangered]] [[Mexican wolf|Mexican gray wolf]] is kept in captivity for breeding purposes.]]

== Behavior of animals in captivity ==
Captive animals, especially those not domesticated, sometimes develop [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviours]].

One type of abnormal behaviour is ''[[stereotypical behavior]]s'', i.e. repetitive and apparently purposeless motor behaviors. Examples of stereotypical behaviours include pacing, self-injury, route tracing and excessive self-grooming. These behaviors are associated with stress and lack of stimulation. Many who keep animals in captivity attempt to prevent or decrease stereotypical behavior by introducing stimuli, a process known as [[Behavioral enrichment|environmental enrichment]].

A type of abnormal behavior shown in captive animals is self-injurious behavior (SIB). Self-injurious behavior indicates any activity that involves biting, scratching, hitting, hair plucking, or [[eye poke]] that may result in injuring oneself.&lt;ref name=Rommeck&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rommeck |first1=Ina |first2=Kristen |last2=Anderson |first3=Allison |last3=Heagerty |first4=Ashley |last4=Cameron |first5=Brenda |last5=McCowan |title=Risk factors and remediation of self-injurious and self-abuse behavior in rhesus macaques |journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science |year=2009 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10888700802536798 |doi=10.1080/10888700802536798|pmc=4443667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its reported incidence is low, self-injurious behavior is observed across a range of primate species, especially when they experience [[social isolation]] in infancy.&lt;ref name=Hosey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosey |first1=Geoff R. |first2=Lindsay J. |last2=Skyner |title=Self-injurious behavior in zoo primates |journal=International Journal of Primatology |year=2007 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1431–1437 |doi=10.1007/s10764-007-9203-z |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10764-007-9203-z |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the arms, legs, shoulders, or genitals. Threat bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the hand, wrist, or forearm—while staring at the observer, conspecific, or mirror in a threatening manner. Self-hit involves striking oneself on any part of the body. Eye poking is a behavior (widely observed in [[primates]]) that presses the knuckle or finger into the orbital space above the eye socket. [[Hair plucking]] is a jerking motion applied to one’s own hair with hands or teeth, resulting in its excessive removal.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt;

The proximal causes of self-injurious behavior have been widely studied in captive [[primates]]; either social or nonsocial factors can trigger this type of behavior. Social factors include changes in group composition, stress, separation from the group, approaches by or aggression from members of other groups, [[conspecific]] male individuals nearby, separation from females, and removal from the group.&lt;ref name=Hosey/&gt; [[Social isolation]], particularly disruptions of early mother-rearing experiences, is an important risk factor.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt; Studies have suggested that, although mother-reared [[rhesus macaques]] still exhibit some self-injurious behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Erwin |first2=G. |last2=Mitchell |first3=Terry |last3=Maple |title=Abnormal behavior in non-isolate-reared rhesus monkeys |journal=Psychological Reports |year=1973 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=515–523 |url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1973.33.2.515 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1973.33.2.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; nursery-reared rhesus macaques are much more likely to self-abuse than mother-reared ones.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt; Nonsocial factors include the presence of a small cut, a wound or irritant, cold weather, human contact, and frequent zoo visitors.&lt;ref name=Hosey/&gt; For example, a study has shown that zoo visitor density positively correlates with the number of gorillas banging on the barrier, and that low zoo visitor density caused gorillas to behave in a more relaxed way. Captive animals often cannot escape the attention and disruption caused by the general public, and the stress resulting from this lack of environmental control may lead to an increased rate of self-injurious behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Deborah L. |title=A note on the influence of visitors on the behavior and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2005 |volume=93 |issue=1-2 |pages=13–17 |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(05)00181-4/pdf |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.019 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of self inflicted harm, some animals exhibit harm towards others and internal psychological harm. This can be exhibited in various forma, such as Orca whales, which never have killed a human in the wild, killing two of its own trainers. Psychological tics can also be identified, ranging from swaying to head bobbing to pacing. Continuous inbreeding is also bringing out mental disadvantages, such as crossed eyes and infertility.

Studies suggest that many abnormal captive behaviors, including [[Self-injurious behavior#Other animals|self-injurious behavior]], can be successfully treated by pair housing. Pair housing provides a previously single-housed animal with a same-sex social partner;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Kate C. |first2=Mollie A. |last2=Bloomsmith |first3=Brooke |last3=Oettinger |first4=Kimberly |last4=Neu |first5=Caroline |last5=Griffis |first6=Valérie |last6=Schoof |first7=Margaret |last7=Maloney |title=Benefits of pair housing are consistent across a diverse population of rhesus macaques |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2012 |volume=137 |issue=3-4 |pages=148–156 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2011.09.010 |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(11)00304-2/pdf |subscription=yes|pmc=4307811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this method is especially effective with primates, which are widely known to be [[social animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.L. |last=Weed |first2=P.O. |last2=Wagner |first3=R. |last3=Byrum |first4=S. |last4=Parrish |first5=M. |last5=Knezevich |first6=D.A. |last6=Powell |title=Treatment of persistent self-injurious behavior in rhesus monkeys through socialization: A preliminary report |journal=Contemporary Topics in Laboratory Animal Science |year=2003 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=21–23 |pmid=14510519 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social companionship provided by pair housing encourages social interaction, thus reducing abnormal and anxiety-related behavior in captive animals as well as increasing their [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]].&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

A '''childhood secret club''' is an informal [[organization]] created by children.

==Key elements==
Some common features of a childhood secret club may include:

'''Names.'''  Unlike [[clique]]s, these associations often have names. These younger groups don't have the social competition that adolescent cliques do, or the level of bad behaviour that street [[gang]]s have. However, in rare instances there may be rivalry with other such groups around the same age, which can lead to physical fights between them.

'''Peer leadership.''' Unlike group activities like [[Scouting]], which are led by adults, these groups are led by children.

'''[[Pro forma]] secrecy.''' The secrecy may be more imaginary than real. For instance the name of the club (if it has one) and its membership are usually obvious to all. There may be a desire to create secret [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and plans, but they are rarely implemented. A ramshackle den, [[tree house]], clubhouse, fort, or "secret base" may be built in nearby scrub-land or an abandoned building. Some children in a secret club may use a part of the grounds of the school they attend together as their "base" during periods of recess.

'''Single-sex membership.''' Such clubs are usually either all boys or all girls but not mixed {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} but exceptions do occur. There may be a sense of competition between the genders, as well as independence from adult authority.

'''Catch-phrase/greetings/secret words.''' Sometimes the clubs develop one or more secret catch-phrases or (sometimes nonsensical words) and greetings. This is illustrated in the 1982 film ''[[P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang]]''.

==Their status==
Many schools have rules against secret clubs, and some jurisdictions even have laws prohibiting secret or invitation-only societies in public elementary or secondary schools.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The fact that interest in these clubs tends to be a passing phase at a certain age{{clarify|reason=Avoid weasel words / What age?|date=June 2015}} may result from the stages of children's [[cognitive development]]. After growing out of the "[[egocentric]]", or "preoperational" stage, {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} reaching the "[[age of reason]]", one is able to understand other people's intentions. The next step is the ability to understand groups and the desire to belong to a club.

Written material about these secret clubs, such as the external links listed below, cites eight- and nine-year-olds most often. While slightly older children may also participate in secret clubs, they would be less expected to use fantasy elements in their activities.

Juvenile comics and literature often feature such clubs as a [[plot device]], often with spy or detective themes, and often far more organized than their real-life counterparts. A more realistic depiction is found in [[Zilpha Keatley Snyder]]'s novel ''[[The Egypt Game]]'', in which six children gather in an abandoned storage yard to [[Storytelling game|enact fantasy adventures]] and recreate actual ceremonies based on and adapted from their knowledge of ancient Egypt.

Movies have featured such clubs, notably the early [[Ealing Studios|Ealing]] comedy-thriller [[Hue and Cry (film)|''Hue &amp; Cry'']]. There are also juvenile non-fiction books that serve as "how-to's" for code-making and [[surveillance]], most notably the [[Usborne Publishing|Usborne]] ''[[Good Spy Guide]]'' series.

{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}
A '''classic''' is an outstanding example of a particular style; something of [[Masterpiece|lasting worth]] or with a timeless quality; of the first or [[Literary merit|highest quality]], class, or rank&lt;ref name="dref" /&gt; &amp;ndash; something that [[Exemplification|exemplifies]] its [[Class (philosophy)|class]]. The word can be an [[adjective]] (a ''classic'' car) or a [[noun]] (a ''classic'' of English literature). It denotes a particular quality in art, architecture, literature, design, technology, or other cultural artifacts. In commerce, products are named 'classic' to denote a long-standing popular version or model, to distinguish it from a newer variety. ''Classic'' is used to describe many major, long-standing sporting events. Colloquially, an everyday occurrence (e.g. a joke or mishap) may be described in some dialects of English as 'an absolute classic'.

"Classic" should not be confused with ''classical'', which refers specifically to certain cultural styles, especially in [[Classical music|music]] and [[Classical architecture|architecture]]: styles generally taking inspiration from the [[Classical tradition]], hence [[classicism]].

==The Classics==
{{main article|Classics}}
The [[classics]] are the literature of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], known as [[classical antiquity]], and once the principal subject studied in the [[humanities]].  Classics (without the definite article) can refer to the study of philosophy, literature, history and the arts of the ancient world, as in "reading classics at Cambridge". From that usage came the more general concept of 'classic'.&lt;ref name="dref"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/classic] Definition of classic at dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese classics]] occupy a similar position in [[Chinese culture]], and various other cultures have their own classics.

==Cultural classics==
Books, films and music particularly may become ''a classic'' but a painting would more likely be called a [[masterpiece]]. A classic is often something old that is still popular.

The first known use of "classic" in this sense — a work so excellent that it is on the level of the "classics" (Greek and Latin authors) — is by the 18th-century scholar [[John Bowle (writer)|Rev. John Bowle]]. He applied the term to ''[[Don Quixote]]'', of which Bowle prepared an innovative edition, such as he judged that a classic work needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article
|title=A letter to the Reverend Dr. Percy : concerning a new and classical edition of Historia del valeroso cavallero Don Quixote de la Mancha
|first=John
|last=Bowle
|authorlink=John Bowle (writer)
|location=London
|year=2001
|volume=21
|number=1
|pages=95–146
|journal=Cervantes (journal of the [[Cervantes Society of America]])
|url=https://www.h-net.org/~cervantes/csa/artics01/bowle2.pdf
|quote=First edition 1777.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other examples would be the book ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' by [[Mark Twain]], the 1941 film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and the song [[Heartbreak Hotel]] by [[Elvis Presley]]. Lists of classics are long and wide-ranging,{{cn|date=November 2018}} and would vary depending on personal opinion. [[Classic rock]] is a popular radio format, playing a repertoire of old but familiar recordings.

A contemporary work may be hailed as an ''instant classic'', but the criteria for classic status tends to include the test of time. The term "classic" is in fact often generalized to refer to any work of a certain age, regardless of whether it is any good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cult classic]] may be well known but is only favored by a minority.

==Science and technology==
A well known and reliable procedure, such as a demonstration of well-established scientific principle, may be described as classic: e.g. the [[cartesian diver]] experiment.

==Consumer artifacts==
Manufacturers frequently describe their products as classic, to distinguish the original from a new variety, or to imply qualities in the product – although the [[Ford Consul Classic]], a car manufactured 1961–1963, has the "classic" tag for no apparent reason. The [[iPod classic]] was simply called the iPod until the sixth generation, when ''classic'' was added to the name because other designs were also available – an example of a [[retronym]]. ''Coca-Cola Classic'' is the name used for the relaunch of [[Coca-Cola]] after the failure of the [[New Coke]] recipe change. Similarly, the [[Classic (transit bus)]], a transit bus manufactured from 1982–97, succeeded an unpopular futuristic design.

A classic can be something old that remains prized or valuable (but not an [[antique]]). [[Classic car]]s, for example, are recognised by various collectors' organisations such as the [[Classic Car Club of America]], who regulate the qualifying attributes that constitute classic status.

==Sport==
Many sporting events take the name ''classic'':

*Horse races, e.g. [[British Classic Races]]
*Snooker tournaments e.g. the [[Wuxi Classic]]
*College Basketball e.g. the [[Charleston Classic]]
*Major League Baseball All-Star Game e.g. the [[Midsummer Classic]]
*[[World Baseball Classic]]
*National Hockey League, the [[Winter Classic]].
*Cycling, the [[Classic cycle races]]

In Spanish-speaking countries, the term "Clásico" refers to a match between two [[Association football|football]] teams known as traditional rivals, e.g. [[El Clásico]] in Spain.&lt;sup&gt;rr&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Critical university studies (CUS)''' is a new field examining the role of [[higher education]] in contemporary society and its relation to culture, politics, and labor. Arising primarily from [[Cultural Studies]], it takes a [[Critical theory|critical stance]] toward changes to the university since the 1970s, particularly the shift away from a strong [[Public university|public model]] of higher education to a [[neoliberal]] [[privatized]] model. Emerging largely in the United States, which has the most extensive system of higher education, the field has also seen significant work in the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries confronting neoliberalism. Key themes of CUS research are [[corporatization]], academic labor, and [[student debt]], among other issues.

Like those doing research under the banner of [[Critical Legal Studies]] (CLS), scholars of Critical University Studies often have an activist bent.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''[http://www.robertounger.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-critical-legal-studies-movement-another-time-a-greater-task.pdf The Critical Legal Studies Movement]''. New York: Verso, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; CLS and CUS both analyze powerful institutions in order to draw attention to structural inequalities and embedded practices of exploitation and marginalization. In addition, both fields seek to move beyond abstract theorizing, targeting institutional practices and making proposals for policy changes.

In contrast to CLS, which has roots in elite institutions like [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], CUS largely comes out of public colleges and universities. While CLS has tended to seek remedies in the legal system, CUS has gravitated toward student and labor union movements. Moreover, CUS has emphasized investigative reportage and exposés of current institutional policies and practices alongside academic work. Rather than a uniform group, CUS includes a range of scholars, critics, and activists, among them [[Tenure|tenured professors]], graduate students, and [[Adjunct professors in North America|adjunct instructors]].

== History ==
The term “Critical University Studies” was first defined in print by Jeffrey J. Williams in a 2012 article in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.&lt;ref name= "Jeff"&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/An-Emerging-Field-Deconstructs/130791 An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe]." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', February 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaschik, Scott. "[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/09/mla-scholars-talk-about-how-their-teaching-focuses-tough-issues-higher-ed Critical University Studies.]" ''Inside Higher Ed'', January 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece, “An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe,” describes the “new wave of criticism of higher education” that came to the fore in the 1990s and has gained momentum in the ensuing decades. This new work has primarily come from [[Literary Studies|literary]] and cultural critics, as well as those in [[Education Studies|education]], history, [[sociology]], and [[labor studies]].&lt;ref name= "Jeff"/&gt; As Williams notes, criticism of higher education has a strong tradition, and scholars like Heather Steffen have traced CUS's lineage at least to the early 20th century, for example to [[Thorstein Veblen]]’s ''The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men'' (1918) and [[Upton Sinclair]]’s ''The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education'' (1923), which criticize the influence of business principles and [[Gilded Age]] wealth on the emerging university system.&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Heather. “[https://www.academia.edu/426574/Intellectual_Proletarians_in_the_20th_Century Intellectual Proletarians in the 20th Century.]” ''Chronicle of Higher Education.'' November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein. ''[http://www.elegant-technology.com/resource/HI_LEARN.PDF The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men]''. 1918. Ed. Richard R. Teichgraeber III. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Upton.

In addition, the 1960s saw a great deal of criticism of social institutions, and much focused on university campuses. [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) started with a strong statement about higher education, and [[anti-war]] and [[civil rights]] protests were a major presence on US campuses. The [[Critical Pedagogy]] movement, inspired by [[Paolo Freire]] and furthered by [[Henry Giroux]] and others, arose from this moment.&lt;ref&gt;Loughead, Tanya. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WXy9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=critical+university+studies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I1dhTaSq6V&amp;sig=Ed4JM6WKR5X2zpM4LelCM5t0nkc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU-oGAnfbVAhWJq1QKHVi3D-I4KBDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=critical%20university%20studies&amp;f=false Critical University: Moving Higher Education Forward]''. Lanham: MD, Lexington Books, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist movement]] also played a role in criticism of the university during the ‘60s and ‘70s, with activists like [[Adrienne Rich]] calling for “a women-centered university.”&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Adrienne. “Toward a Woman-Centered University.” ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Lies_Secrets_and_Silence_Selected_Pro.html?id=wSm6BwAAQBAJ On Lies, Secrets, and Silence: Selected Prose]'' 1966-1978. New York: Norton, 1979. 125-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] granted universities the right to patent their inventions, thereby encouraging them to conduct research with business aims in mind. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, critics began to address the new direction of higher education, often coming from the graduate student unionization movement.&lt;ref name= "Williams"/&gt; Some met in conferences such as “Reworking/Rethinking the University” at the [[University of Minnesota]] (2008–11), or came out of groups such as Edu-factory, which was inspired by the Italian [[autonomist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://rethinkingtheu.wordpress.com/ Conference – Beneath the University, the Commons]." Reworking/Rethinking the University. November 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Edu-factory Collective, ed.

New York, NY: Autonomedia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This first wave of CUS publications addressed the corporatization of higher education, along with the exploitation of academic labor and the rise of student debt. Key texts from this period include Sheila Slaughter and Larry Leslie's ''Academic Capitalism: Politics, Policies, and the Entrepreneurial University'' (1997), [[David F. Noble|David Noble's]] ''Digital Diploma Mills: The Automation of Higher Education'' (2001), Marc Bousquet's “The Waste Product of Graduate Education” (2002) and ''How the University Works: Higher Education and the Low-Wage Nation'' (2008).&lt;ref name= "Ethos"&gt;Walker, Katherine, and Benjamin Mangrum.

More recently, a second wave of CUS scholars have widened the field's scope to address issues including universities’ reliance on proprietorial technology, the dominance of [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial values]], and [[globalization]]. Notable texts in this vein include Newfield's ''The Great Mistake: How We Wrecked Public Universities and How We Can Fix Them'' (2016), [[Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist)|Benjamin Ginsberg's]] ''The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters'' (2011), Robert Samuels’ ''Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free: How to Decrease Cost and Increase Quality at American Universities'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Christopher.

In addition, after Britain adopted neoliberal policies and raised tuitions from minor fees to major levels, critics such as Stefan Collini, in “Browne’s Gamble” (2010), and Andrew McGettigan, in ''The Great University Gamble: Money, Markets, and the Future of Higher Education'' (2013), focused on the United Kingdom. Meng-Hsuan Chou, Isaac Kamola, and Tamson Pietsch's edited volume ''The Transnational Politics of Higher Education'' (2016) looks at globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Collini, Stefan. “[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/stefan-collini/brownes-gamble Browne’s Gamble],” ''London Review of Books'', 32(21): 23-25, 4 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGettigan, Andrew.

London: Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key themes ==
Although continually responding to new trends in higher education, Critical University Studies has so far concerned itself with several key themes:

* [[Privatization]] and Corporatization: CUS research shows the various ways that public investment in universities has decreased as costs have been shifted to students and their families. As a 2014 report from public policy organization [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] shows, state funding for higher education has progressively decreased since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Hiltonsmith, Robert, and Tamara Draut. "[http://www.demos.org/publication/great-cost-shift-continues-state-higher-education-funding-after-recession The Great Cost Shift Continues: State Higher Education Funding After the Recession]." Demos. March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, universities appear to be acting more and more like corporations, enhancing managerial administration, cutting full-time faculty labor, and treating students like customers. The result is a higher education system that functions as “a mercantile market rather than a public realm apart from the market,” with those attending reconfigured “as job seekers rather than as citizens” — a dramatic alteration from the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Humanism|humanistic]] university of the postwar US.&lt;ref name ="Williams"&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. “The Need for Critical University Studies,” in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=23SwCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=A+New+Deal+for+the+Humanities:+Liberal+Arts+and+the+Future+of+Public+Higher+Education&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s A New Deal for the Humanities: Liberal Arts and the Future of Public Higher Education]''. Edited by Gordon Hutner and Feisal G. Mohamed. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2016. 145-157.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wage labour|Labor]]: According to the New Faculty Majority, a US-based adjunct advocacy group that formed in 2009, three quarters of college faculty are now off the tenure track, with no access to the job stability that universities historically provided.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newfacultymajority.info/facts-about-adjuncts/ Facts about adjuncts]." New Faculty Majority. January 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this group, over half are adjunct or part-time workers, positions characterized by low wages and lack of [[job security]]. CUS takes issue with this new norm of [[Precarious work|precarious labor]], as well as with the increasing burden on graduate students to take on heavy teaching loads. As such, CUS has organic connections to [[graduate student unionization]] and adjunct labor organization efforts.&lt;ref name= "Jeff" /&gt;
* Student Debt: In 2015, 68% of graduating students in the US left college with some student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Zack. "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2017/02/21/student-loan-debt-statistics-2017/#48b00e25daba Student Loan Debt In 2017: A $1.3 Trillion Crisis]." Forbes, February 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a dramatic increase from student debt during previous eras of higher education, a development that CUS attributes to the effects of neoliberal policies on universities. For one thing, higher education now tends to be framed as a private endeavor rather than as a public service, a shift that has resulted in reductions to state funding and subsequent increases in tuition costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Michael J. “State Preferences for Higher Education Spending: A Panel Data Analysis, 1977-2001.” ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/What_s_Happening_to_Public_Higher_Educat.html?id=9dFLSnKeKP8C What’s Happening to Public Higher Education? The Shifting Financial Burden]''. Ed. Ronald G. Ehrenberg. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. 3-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, college student loan debt has increased nearly 1000% (while the price of consumer goods has increased only about 250%).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/cost-of-college-degree-increase-12-fold-1120-percent-bloomberg_n_1783700.html Cost Of College Degree In U.S. Has Increased 1,120 Percent In 30 Years, Report Says]." HuffPost. August 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been exacerbated by a shift in policy for [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit institutions]]: Since the late 1990s, they have been able to receive up to 90% of their funding from federal aid, and they now represent around 25% of loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Shen, Lucinda. "[http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/student-loan-defaults-2/ For-Profit Colleges Account for a Third of All Federal Student Loan Defaults]." Fortune. September 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelchen, Robert. "[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2017/01/11/how-much-do-for-profit-colleges-rely-on-federal-funds/ How Much Do For-Profit Colleges Rely on Federal Funds?]" Brookings. January 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising awareness about the issue of growing student debt, CUS scholars push for policy changes, such as loan forgiveness and debt-free college.&lt;ref name= "JeffW" /&gt;
* Globalization: American universities are increasingly being exported to locations around the globe through the opening of [[Satellite campus|satellite and affiliate campuses]]. This practice—exemplified by schools like [[New York University]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and [[Duke University]]—often seems to be profit-driven rather than beneficent, with universities receiving large sums of money from local governments in exchange for the presence of the school's brand. For many scholars, the so-called “global university” is merely a perpetuation of Western [[hegemony]].&lt;ref name= "Globe" /&gt;
* [[Innovation]] and Entrepreneurship: A new wave of CUS research has drawn attention to the increasing emphasis that universities place on values of innovation and entrepreneurship. While this focus may seem harmless or even beneficial to students, CUS scholars point out the damaging effects of structuring student's college experience around these buzzwords. Both terms reflect the infiltration of a business mindset into academics, with “innovation” often entailing the mechanization of teaching and a subsequent increase in inequality among student populations.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. "[https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/innovation-for-what-the-politics-of-inequality-in-higher-education Innovation for What? The Politics of Inequality in Higher Education.]" ''Dissent'', Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, entrepreneurship encourages students to adopt a corporate work ethos, with science and tech companies—and increasingly Silicon Valley billionaires—reaping the benefits of student labor.&lt;ref&gt;Wiscomb, Avery J. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Hyperserfs/239433 Hyperserfs: How Silicon Valley Exploits Students and Their Universities.]" ''The Chronicle for Higher Education'', March 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Critical University Studies research has contributed to student and faculty movements across US campuses, including the aforementioned New Faculty Majority, the graduate student union movement, Oregon's CORE faculty-student advocacy group, and the [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] Student Debt Campaign (on which cultural critic [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] has worked).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Andrew. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G0LzAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Creditocracy and the Case for Debt Refusal]''. New York: OR Books, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrina, Stephen. "[http://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/article/view/184777/184351. Critical University Studies: Workplace, Milestones, Crossroads, Respect, Truth]." Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor 23 (2014): 62-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

CUS scholars often publish outside of traditional academic outlets, through blogs like Michael Meranze and Christopher Newfield's Remaking the University, as well as through contributions to new media like [[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]], the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]] (LARB), [[Salon (website)|Salon]] and [[HuffPost]].&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Christopher, and Michael Meranze. [http://utotherescue.blogspot.com/. Remaking the University].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethos"/&gt; Through such non-traditional outlets, as well as through book publications and academic journal articles, CUS has helped to bring issues like student debt into the mainstream political conversation.&lt;ref name= "Williams"/&gt;

=== Unionization ===

Alongside CUS criticism and activism in the 1990s, U.S. campuses saw a rise in unionization efforts. This culminated in a 2000 decision by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) that graduate employees were protected by the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and could unionize.&lt;ref&gt;United Automobile Workers. "[https://uaw.org/uaw-graduate-workers-harvard-reach-historic-union-election-agreement/ UAW Graduate Workers and Harvard Reach Historic Union Election Agreement.]" News release, October 18, 2016. UAW.&lt;/ref&gt; Union efforts proliferated following this decision, with organizations like the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW) and the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU) allying with graduate students and adjunct instructors in the fight for employee status and collective bargaining rights. Despite setbacks, including a 2004 reversal of the 2000 ruling, student and adjunct unions have made significant headway. In August 2016, the NLRB reversed itself again, ruling that graduate research and teaching assistants at private universities do have the right to unionize (UAW vs. Columbia).&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Richard."[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/23/491090762/nlrb-rules-graduate-students-are-employees-with-the-right-to-unionize NLRB Rules Graduate Students Are Employees With The Right To Unionize]." NPR, August 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The journal ''Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor'', co-founded by Bousquet, stemmed from early efforts in the field and continues to publish open-access issues around themes of academic labor and higher education activism.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/index Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 2015 saw the formation of ''Academic Labor: Research and Artistry'', a journal devoted to issues of tenure and contingency in the university.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://journals.colostate.edu/labor Academic Labor: Research and Artistry]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In book publishing, The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] initiated a book series on Critical University Studies, edited by Jeffrey J. Williams and Christopher Newfield, and In the UK, [[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]] also launched a series on CUS, edited by John Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;The Johns Hopkins University Press. "[http://ihum.innovate.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.engl.d7_ih/files/sitefiles/CUS%20Announcement.pdf Critical University Studies]." News release, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palgrave.com/gb/series/14707 Palgrave Critical University Studies]." Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the whole, the stance of CUS against the status quo of US universities puts it at odds with individuals and administrators who are in favor of the continued privatization, corporatization, and globalization of the university.

Scholars like Williams, Steffen, and others continue to call for the incorporation of CUS into the undergraduate curriculum, encouraging students to think critically about the institutions in which they find themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. “[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/229021 Teach the University!]” ''Pedagogy'' (8)1: 25-42, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Robert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2642">'''Cultural emphasis''' is an important aspect of a culture which is often reflected though language and, more specifically, vocabulary (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;266).  This means that the vocabulary people use in a culture indicates what is important to that group of people.  If there are a lot of words to describe a certain topic in a specific culture, then there is a good chance that that topic is considered important to that culture.

== Background ==
The idea of cultural emphasis is rooted form the work of Franz Boas, who is considered to be one of the founders of American Anthropology (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;15). Franz Boas developed and taught concepts such as [[cultural relativism]] and the "cultural unconscious", which allowed anthropologists who studied under him, like [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], to further study and develop ideas on language and culture (Hart, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;179).

== Application ==
One way in which cultural emphasis is exemplified is a populace talks about the weather.  For example, in a place where it is cold and it snows a lot, a large collection of words to describe the snow would be expected.

:For example: [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]], [[blizzard]], [[Ice storm|sleeting]], [[snowdrift]], powder snow, packed snow, fresh snow.

In a place where it is hot, a cornucopia of associated terms would be expected.

:For example: dry heat, muggy, humid, sticky, monsoon season, sweltering.
A concentration of related terms for similar phenomena suggests the importance in distinguishing between them.  Furthermore, if you are not from the area, or that culture, you might not have experienced or know the difference between, for example, a dry heat or a humid heat, when the difference may have huge implications for the outcome of a particular action.

Cambridge: Schenkman. 1965. 19-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural norms that provide these advantages will, in turn, lead to the displacement, absorption or even extinction of other, less successful cultural groups.&lt;ref name="sol" &gt;Soltis, J., Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1995. Can group-functional behaviours evolve by cultural group selection? An empirical test. Current Anthropology 36 (3), 473–494.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[game theory|game theoretic]] models suggest that if individuals are able to migrate between groups (which is common in small-scale societies), differences between groups should be difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name="joe" &gt;Henrich, J. Cultural group selection, coevolutionary processes and large-scale cooperation. Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization. Volume 53, Issue 1, January 2004, 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in psychology reveals that humans have a particular set of traits, which include [[imitation]], [[conformity]], and [[in-group bias]], that are capable of supporting the maintenance of these group differences over extended periods of time.

Cultural group selection gives a compelling explanation for how large-scale complex societies have formed. While altruistic behaviour such as [[kin selection]] and [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] can explain the behaviour of small social groups common in many species, it is unable to explain the large complex societies of unrelated, anonymous individuals that we see in the human species.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; However, one of the major distinctions between humans and other species is our reliance on [[Observational learning|social learning]] in acquiring behaviours.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;Horner, V. Whiten, A. Causal knowledge and imitation/emulation switching in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and children (Homo sapiens). Animal Cognition (2005) 8: 164–181&lt;/ref&gt; These instincts allow for the acquisition and persistence of culture.&lt;ref name="tomasello"&gt;Tomasello, M. The Human Adaptation for Culture. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28, (1999), pp. 509-529&lt;/ref&gt; Through cultural group selection, culturally specific cooperative behaviour can evolve to support large societies.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; For example, in a study that spanned a variety of cultures, testing behaviour in [[Ultimatum game|Ultimatum]], [[Dictator game|Dictator]], and [[Third-party punishment]] games, it was found that standards of fairness and inclination to punish were correlated with both participation in world religions and market integration.&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., et al. Markets, Religion, Community Size, and the Evolution of Fairness and Punishment. Science 327, 1480 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates how many of the behaviours necessary for complex societies are the result of cultural exposure rather than any evolution of our psychology.

== Human adaptations for culture ==
For cultural knowledge and behaviour to persist across multiple generations, humans need to have the capacity to acquire, retain, and transmit cultural information. While many species engage in social learning, humans consistently rely upon it for behavioural cues and information about the environment. In a study comparing human children and young chimpanzees, it was shown that, when given a demonstration on how to retrieve a reward from a box, chimps copy relevant behaviour, while ignoring irrelevant behaviour, to solve the task. Meanwhile, human children will faithfully imitate both relevant and irrelevant behaviour to solve the same task.&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; While this may seem like a negative quality, it is what allows for reliable, high-fidelity transmission of cultural information, and produces stable behavioural equilibria within cultural groups.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

[[Michael Tomasello]] suggests the following three adaptations are necessary for human culture:&lt;ref name="tomasello" /&gt;

=== Joint attention ===
At around 9–12 months infants begin engaging in [[joint attention]]. This involves following the gaze of an adult or using them as social reference points. Put simply, they become aware of the adult's attention and behaviour towards objects in the environment. In this sense, the child is beginning to understand people as goal-oriented intentional agents. This is vitally important for learning through imitation and, eventually, language acquisition.

=== Imitative learning ===
By about 1 year of age, children begin to learn by imitation. At this point, children are capable of discriminating intentional actions from unintentional ones, and will attempt to accurately copy those intentional actions to accomplish tasks they've seen adults do. Because of [[imitative learning]], children will copy those intentional acts which have no perceivable effect on the outcome,&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; as well as strange or unnatural actions when easier methods are available. For example, an [[Andrew Meltzoff]] study found that 14-month-old children will, after seeing an adult do it, bend at the waist and press a panel with their head to turn on a light, instead of using their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzoff A. 1988. Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli. Dev. Psychol. 24:470-76&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tomasello, imitative learning is necessary for learning the symbolic conventions of language.

=== Linguistic symbols and cognitive representation ===
Through imitatively learning, the child comprehends that linguistic symbols are intended to focus attention to some specific aspect of the shared experience. In doing this, the child must be able to take the perspective of the speaker. Due to the intersubjectivity of linguistic symbols, language allows one to communicate various perspectives and shift attention to one aspect of the world over another. In learning a language, a child is inheriting a vast set of linguistic symbols that have been passed down many generations. What is inherited then is the methods of shifting attention and perspective that were historically of importance to the people of that culture.

== Mechanisms that maintain between-group variation ==
Without between-group variation, cultural group selection could not occur, as there would be no group differentiation to select for. While processes such as cultural drift, epidemics, and natural disasters increase between-group variation, migration and genetic mixing decrease between-group variation ''and'' increase within-group variation. Variation is only maintained when cultural groups have mechanisms that prevent the norms of outside groups from invading the cultural group. These ‘mechanisms’ are those uniquely human psychological traits and behaviours that encourage imitation, conformity, and in-group biases.

According to [[Joseph Henrich]], between-group variation is maintained by the following four mechanisms:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Conformist transmission ===
Conformist transmission refers to the psychological bias to preferentially imitate high frequency behaviors in the cultural group. This homogenizes the social group and reinforces widely held cultural norms. This explains why individuals within a social group hold the same beliefs and why these beliefs persist over time. While individuals will rely on copying high frequency behaviors under various conditions, this reliance increases when an individual is exposed to ambiguous environmental or social information.&lt;ref name="Boyd85"&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1985. Culture and the Evolutionary Process. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, G., Fudenberg, D., 1993. Rules of thumb for social learning. Journal of Political Economy 101 (4),
612–643.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R., Vandello, J., Brunsman, B., 1996. The forgotten variable in conformity research: impact of task
importance on social influence. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (5), 915–927.&lt;/ref&gt; Conformist transmission can maintain between-group variation by reducing within-group variation, but it also facilitates the rapid spread of novel ideas, which increases between-group variation.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt; Taken together, reduced within-group variation and increased between-group variation lead to the cultural divergence between groups that is the driving force of cultural group selection.

=== Prestige-biased and self-similarity transmission ===
Prestige-biased transmission is the tendency the copy those members of the group that are more successful. Preferentially copying successful members of the group allows individuals to avoid costly trial-and-error learning by imitating the better-than-average skills of the more prestigious cultural models. Individual can determine the rank of potential models by how much deference they are shown by the rest of the group. Deference is shown to high-prestige individuals to gain the opportunity to copy their successful models. We can see evidence for this bias in how new technologies, or economic practices spread to different groups according to how quick "opinion leaders" adopt them.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M., 1995. Diffusion of Innovations. Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[self-similarity]] transmission is the tendency to copy those individuals who are similar in language, appearance, social standing and other behavioral and cultural traits. In the context of prestige-biased transmission, self-similarity means that individuals will preferentially imitate those high-prestige individuals who are similar to them. From the perspective of an imitator, this trait is adaptive. By only imitating those high-prestige individuals who are similar, the imitator avoids adopting traits or behaviors that are not compatible with his or her knowledge or social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1987. The evolution of ethnic markers. Cultural Anthropology 2 (1), 27–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two social biases act together in reducing within-group variation. Additionally, prestige-biased transmission increases between-group variation by contributing to the spread of novel ideas.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt;

=== Punishment of non-conformists ===
Non-conformists threaten to increase within-group variation by introducing deviant behaviours to the group and must receive costly punishment to maintain a homogenous social group. As a consequence of being punished, non-conformists will be less successful than other members of the group. Prestige-biased transmission would suggest that non-conformist behaviors would, therefore, not spread through the population. Papers on the topic suggest that this kind of punishment is prevalent across many different societies.&lt;ref&gt;Sober, E., Wilson, D.S., 1998. Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior. Harvard
University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, A.E., Prasnikar, V., Okuno-Fujiwara, M., Zamir, S., 1991. Bargaining and market behavior in Jerusalem, Ljubljana, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study. American Economic Review 81 (5), 1068–1095.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., Boyd, R., Bowles, S., Gintis, H., Camerer, C., Fehr, E., McElreath, R., 2001. In search of Homo economicus: experiments in 15 small-scale societies. American Economic Review 91, 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., Gächter, S., 2002. Altruistic punishment in humans. Nature 415, 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative conformity ===
Normative conformity is the act of changing one’s visible behaviour, simply to appear to match the majority, and without actually internalizing the groups opinions. This differs from conformist transmission since normative conformity does not consider frequency of a behaviour as an indicator of worth. The [[Asch conformity experiments]] are a perfect example of how robust this effect is&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S.E., 1951. Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments. In: Guetzkow, H. (Ed.), Groups, Leadership and Men. Carnegie, Pittsburgh, pp. 177–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and its replication across many cultures shows that this behaviour is very common.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A., 1984. Studies of cross-cultural conformity: a brief and critical review. Psychologia: An International
Journal of Psychology in the Orient 27 (1), 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neto, F., 1995. Conformity and independence revisited. Social Behavior and Personality 23 (3), 217–222.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrich suggests that normative conformity may have evolved to respond to the spread of punishing behaviour toward non-conformists.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; By appearing similar to the group, one can gain the advantages of in-group membership, while also avoiding punishment. A curious byproduct of normative conformity is that it can contribute to the conformity transmission of norms that the transmitter does not hold, because they were mistakenly attributed by the imitator.

== Mechanisms ==
As [[Donald T. Campbell]] says, for cultural group selection to occur, there must be cultural differences between groups which affect their persistence or proliferation.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; This means groups are selected ''for'' or ''against'' according to their respective ''gains'' or ''losses'' relative to other groups.

Joseph Henrich describes the three mechanisms through which this process occurs:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Demographic swamping ===
Demographic swamping occurs when one or more cultural groups reproduces individuals faster than other groups in the region because of stable, culturally transmitted ideas or practices.  This is the slowest kind of cultural groups selection as it depends on natural selection of between-group cultural variation operating on a scale of millennia. It has been suggested that this is how early agriculturalist displaced hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., Menozzi, P., Piazza, A., 1994. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton
University Press, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young and Bettinger, 1992Young, D., Bettinger, R.L., 1992. The numic spread: a computer simulation. American Antiquity 57 (1), 85–99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, J.M., 1997. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct intergroup competition ===
Direct intergroup competition is the process by which cultural groups compete with each other over resources by engaging in warfare and raiding. The cultural practices and behaviour that gives an advantage to one group over another will proliferate at the expense of those who cannot compete. There are many possible traits that could contribute to a group's success, such as technological development, social and political organization, economic development, nationalism, etc. According to Joseph Soltis, it would take 500–1000 years for group selection to happen this way.&lt;ref name="sol" /&gt;

=== Prestige-biased group selection ===
In prestige-biased group selection, when individuals have opportunities to copy people from nearby groups, they will preferentially imitate the members of groups that are more cooperative than their own. Since cooperative groups have a higher average payoff than non-cooperative groups, members of cooperative groups will be considered more prestigious and worthy of imitation.

A '''cultural universal''' (also called an '''anthropological universal''' or '''human universal'''), as discussed by [[Emile Durkheim]], [[George Murdock]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] and others, is an element, pattern, trait, or institution that is common to all [[human culture]]s worldwide. Taken together, the whole body of cultural universals is known as the [[human condition]]. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. ''Psychology''. Worth Publishers. pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropological and sociological theorists that take a [[cultural relativist]] perspective may deny the existence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are "cultural" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited [[ethology|behavior]] is an issue of "[[nature versus nurture]]".

==General==
The emergence of these universals dates to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], with the first evidence of full [[behavioral modernity]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Bold claim, no source...|date=July 2018}}

==Non-nativist explanations==
The observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.&lt;ref&gt;Language: The cultural tool DL Everett - 2012 - Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;

Since any cultures that have been [[anthropology|studied by anthropologists]] have had contact with at least the anthropologists that studied it, and anthropological [[research ethics]] slows the studies down so that other groups unbound by such ethics, often at least locally represented by people of the same skin color as the supposedly isolated tribe but significantly culturally globalized, reach the tribe before the anthropologists do, no truly uncontacted culture has ever been scientifically studied.&lt;ref&gt;Fam Med. 2008 Jan;40(1) Continuing professional development in sensitive cultures. Huntington MK1.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows outside influence to be an explanation for cultural universals as well.&lt;ref&gt;Equal Recognition: The Moral Foundations of Minority Rights, Alan Patten 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of [[civilization]] and is therefore not the same thing as [[hyperdiffusionism]], it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of [[innateness]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultures and Globalization: Cultural Expression, Creativity and Innovation, Helmut K Anheier, Yudhishthir Raj Isar 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication bias in population level universals==
Anthropology's application of one ordinary evidence standard for data that agrees with its theories of cultural universals and one extraordinary standard of evidence for data that disagree with it raises issues with population level [[publication bias]]. While it is possible with strong enough evidence for the validity of one case study that disagree to pass [[peer review]], those that agree will statistically do so more often than those that disagree even if the level of evidence is the same. Since multiple field studies regarding the same culture are combined when statistical prevalences of behaviors are assessed, the result may cause appearances of behaviors having a supposedly universal statistical demographic even if it does not. Some anthropologists suggest that this may give an appearance of statistics such as more men than women hunting large prey being universal without actually being universal, for example that field studies in which more men than women hunted passed peer review while field studies for the same culture in which the genders were equal or inverted for hunting were not published. &lt;ref&gt;"Epidemiology and Culture: Anthropology, Anthropology", CTI Reviews, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluating Scientific Research: Separating Fact from Fiction", Fred Leavitt, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Czech Vašek''' (literal. "Czech [[Václav]]") is a [[historical figure]] [[national personification|representing the national character]] of the Czech people used in time of national competition with German nationalism at the end of the 19th century.

==Overview==
Such figures differ from those that serve as [[national personifications|personifications]] of the nation itself, as [[Čechie]] did the [[Czechs|Czech nation]] and [[Marianne]] the [[France|French]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "Mass-Producing Traditions: Europe, 1870–1914," in Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger, eds., The Invention of Tradition (Cambridge, 1983), 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is usually depicted in a [[folk costume]] combining hat from Pilsen region with clothes from different regions.

They were used as a negative caricature of Czechs by Germans, symbolising them as street musicians. But also positively by Czech themselves.

Czech Vašek is considered a counterpart to [[Deutscher Michel]], a figure representing the national character of the German people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/kazdy-narod-ma-sveho-svejka-ten-izraelsky-nevaha-sahnout-po-samopalu-1jj-/zahranicni.aspx?c=A100902_161039_zahranicni_aha|title=Každý národ má svého Švejka.

[[Image:Skegness4web.jpg|thumb|British seaside donkeys in [[Skegness]], [[Lincolnshire]], used for donkey rides on the beach.]]

'''Donkey rides''' are a traditional feature of [[seaside resort]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]. Children are allowed to ride [[donkey]]s on a sandy [[beach]] for a fee in summer months while on holiday, normally led in groups at walking pace. Typically, the donkeys used to have their names on their [[safety harness|harnesses]] so they could be identified by children and parents alike.

Donkey rides have been available since 1886 in [[Weston Super Mare]] and since 1895 in [[Bridlington]].

The tradition started in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, but is now much less popular. It is probable that the donkeys offered to ride on were originally working draught animals in the cockle industries around the coast.

'''Ethnology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἔθνος'', ''ethnos'' meaning "nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ethno-|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethno-?q=ethno|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the branch of [[anthropology]] that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different [[peoples]] and the relationships between them (cf. [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[social anthropology|social]], or [[sociocultural anthropology]]).&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=ethnology|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethnology?q=ethnology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific discipline==
{{further information|Ethnicity}}
Compared to [[ethnography]], the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.

[[File:AFKollar 1779.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Adam František Kollár]], 1779]]
The term ''ethnologia'' (''ethnology'') is credited to [[Adam František Kollár|Adam Franz Kollár]] (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his ''Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates'' published in [[Vienna]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Zmago Šmitek and Božidar Jezernik, "The anthropological tradition in Slovenia." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. ''Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; as: “the science of nations and peoples, or, that study of learned men in which they inquire into the origins, languages, customs, and institutions of various nations, and finally into the fatherland and ancient seats, in order to be able better to judge the nations and peoples in their own times.” &lt;ref&gt;Kollár, Adam František  − Historiae jurisque publici regni Ungariae amoenitates, I-II. Vienna., 1783&lt;/ref&gt;

Kollár's interest in linguistic and cultural diversity was aroused by the situation in his native multi-ethnic and multilingual [[History of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary]] and his roots among its [[Slovak people|Slovaks]], and by the shifts that began to emerge after the gradual retreat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the more distant [[Balkans#Population composition by nationality and religion|Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghiţă Geană, "Discovering the whole of humankind: the genesis of anthropology through the Hegelian looking-glass." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of [[human history]], and the formulation of [[culture|cultural]] [[universal (metaphysics)|invariants]], such as the [[incest taboo]] and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about "[[human nature]]", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]], [[structuralism]], etc.). In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] doctrine, with ''[[cultural anthropology]]'' becoming dominant especially in the [[United States]], and ''[[social anthropology]]'' in [[Great Britain]].  The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.

[[File:Levi-strauss_260.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]]]
The 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the [[Western world]]), such as the notion of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]".  This term was used in conjunction with "savages", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the "[[noble savage]]". Thus, [[civilization]] was opposed in a dualist manner to [[barbary]], a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared [[ethnocentrism]]. The progress of ethnology, for example with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structural anthropology]], led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear [[progress (history)|progress]], or the pseudo-opposition between "societies with histories" and "societies without histories", judged too dependent on a limited view of [[history]] as constituted by accumulative growth.

Lévi-Strauss often referred to [[Montaigne]]'s [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] on [[cannibalism]] as an early example of ethnology. Lévi-Strauss aimed, through a [[structuralism|structural method]], at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the [[incest taboo]]. However, the claims of such cultural [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Derrida]], [[Althusser]], and [[Deleuze]].

The French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included Lévi-Strauss, [[Paul Rivet]], [[Marcel Griaule]], [[Germaine Dieterlen]], and [[Jean Rouch]].

The '''Frankfurt Christmas Market''' (in [[German language|German]]: ''Frankfurter Weinachtmarkt''&lt;ref name="leaflet14"&gt;{{citation| title=Frankfurter Weinachtmarkt – Frankfurt Christmas Market 23.11. – 22.12.2014 | publisher=Tourismus+Congress GmbH | location= Frankfurt am Main | date=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an annual outdoor [[Christmas market]] in central [[Frankfurt]], [[Hessen]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="frankfurt-tourismus"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frankfurt-tourismus.de/en/Discover-Experience/Events/Festivals-in-Frankfurt/Frankfurt-Christmas-Market | title=Frankfurt Christmas Market | website=[http://www.frankfurt-tourismus.de/ frankfurt-tourismus.de] | location=Germany | accessdate=18 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christmas market opens in late November and continues until just before [[Christmas]] (normally 22 December) during [[Advent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1618">'''Generationism''' is the belief that a specific generation has inherent traits that make it inferior or superior to another generation. The term is usually applied to claims of superiority in the expressed values, valuations, lifestyles and general beliefs of one generation compared to those of another, where objectively verifiable criteria substantiating the claim of superiority in themselves are lacking. 

Generationism is most commonly used as an accusation against the belief that the contemporary generation in itself is inherently superior to previous generations, for example through the common practice of pejoratively referring to ancient cultures as "primitive" – not to be confused with the positive label of [[primitivism]] – although an older generation's opposition to the values and lifestyles of a younger generation may also popularly be referred to as generationist.

Generationism as a recurring sociological phenomenon has been studied in detail by the Swedish philosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] in their work "The Global Empire" (published in Swedish in 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{BardSoderqvist2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bard and Söderqvist regard generationism as a close but far less frequently analyzed relative of [[racism]] which they propose should be studied in more detail to strengthen the general argumentation for [[relativism]] and [[pragmatism]] in contemporary philosophy.

'''''Germanische Altertumskunde Online''''', formerly called '''''Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde''''', is a German encyclopedia of the study of Germanic history and cultures, as well as the cultures that were in close contact with them.

The first edition of the ''Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde'' appeared in four volumes between 1911 and 1919, edited by [[Johannes Hoops]]. The second edition, under the auspices of the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], was edited by [[Heinrich Beck (Germanist)|Heinrich Beck]] (from vol 1, 1968/72), [[Heiko Steuer]] (from vol. 8, 1991/94), Rosemarie Müller (from 1992), and [[Dieter Geuenich]] (from vol. 13, 1999), and was published by [[Walter de Gruyter]] between 1969 and 2008.

In 2010, the most recent version was published, now renamed ''Germanische Altertumskunde Online''. Edited by Heinrich Beck, [[Sebastian Brather]], [[Dieter Geuenich]], [[Wilhelm Heizmann]], [[Steffen Patzold]], and [[Heiko Steuer]], it is published online by De Gruyter, accessible via subscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.degruyter.com/databasecontent?dbid=gao&amp;dbsource=%2Fdb%2Fgao degruyter.com: ''Germanische Altertumskunde Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grisi siknis''' (in [[Miskito language]], from the English, means "crazy sickness") is a contagious, [[culture-bound syndrome]] that occurs predominantly among the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] People of eastern [[Central America]] and affects mainly young women.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dennis|first1=Philip A.|title=Part three: Grisi Siknis Among the Miskito|journal=Medical Anthropology|volume=5|issue=4|year=1981|pages=445–505|issn=0145-9740|doi=10.1080/01459740.1981.9986998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as "grisi munaia", "Chipil siknis" and "Nil siknis". More recently cases occurring amongst people of Spanish descent have also been reported.

== Description ==

According to Dr. Phil Dennis of [[Texas Tech University]], ''grisi siknis'' is typically characterized by longer periods of anxiety, nausea, dizziness, irrational anger and fear, interlaced with short periods of rapid frenzy, in which the victim "lose[s] consciousness, believe[s] that devils beat them and have sexual relations with them" and runs away.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt;

Often the outbreak of the syndrome is violent in nature, with victims grabbing weapons, attacking unseen enemies and/or hurting themselves.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt;

The causes of grisi siknis are unknown, says the [[American Psychology Association]], but the prevailing Western theory calls this syndrome a "psychological disorder due to stress, upheaval and despair".&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association. Task Force on DSM-IV.|authorlink=American Psychiatric Association|title=[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]: [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV-TR: the current version|DSM-IV-TR: 4th Edition Text Revision]]|year=2000|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|location=[[Washington, DC]], United States|isbn=9780890420256|oclc=312629275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Miskito belief, says Dennis, holds that grisi siknis is the result of evil spirits or black sorcerers.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; While Western medicine typically has no effect on those afflicted with the disease, the remedies of Miskito herbalists or witch doctors are often successful in curing grisi siknis.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt;

==Symptoms==

Symptoms of grisi siknis vary, but there is a distinct set of central characteristics. Most of the victims are young girls from 15 to 18 years old.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; The attacks are prefaced by headaches, dizziness, anxiety, nausea, irrational anger and/or fear.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; During the attack, the "victim loses consciousness" and falls to the ground, subsequently running away, which running Dennis calls "perhaps the most distinctive defining characteristic of grisi siknis behavior".&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; The victim may view other people as devils, feel no pain for bodily injuries and have absolute amnesia regarding their physical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; Some grab machetes or broken bottles to wave off unseen assailants.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; Other victims are reported to have performed superhuman feats,&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; vomited strange objects such as spiders, hair and coins &lt;ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Nicola|date=June 2006|title=Nicaragua’s Crazy Sickness|journal=[[The Walrus]]|location=[[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada|publisher=Walrus Foundation|url=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2006.06-anthropology-nicaragua-grisi-siknis/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoken in tongues.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; In some cases the semi-conscious victim will speak the names of the next to be infected, although it is not always accurate.&lt;ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/&gt; It is still highly contagious.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; During attacks, victims report mental visions in which devils or evil spirits come for them, and have sex with them.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; These visions also include anything from horrifying nightmares to pleasant experiences, and many anthropologists claim these are sexual experiences.  This is a disputed fact, as not all cases involve sexual encounters.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; Attacks occur anywhere from multiple times a day to rarely when one is infected with grisi siknis.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; A person typically remains with the disease for several months to a year without medical attention, although some cases have been documented to recur for much longer.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt;

== Grisi siknis in relation to culturally bound syndromes ==

Joseph Westermeyer, Head of [[Psychiatry]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]], states that a culturally bound syndrome is defined as "certain trance-like disturbances [that] occur with unusual frequencies in certain societies".&lt;ref name="Westermeyer 798-804"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westermeyer|first=Joseph|title=Psychiatric diagnosis across cultural boundaries|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=142|issue=7|pages=798–805|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=July 1985|pmid=4014501|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=142&amp;page=798}}&lt;/ref&gt; These syndromes, he says, actually occur in a wide variety of cultures separated by great distance that have similar symptoms  including "fear, anxiety, amnesia, aimless escape, psychophysiological symptoms, social withdrawal, behavioral deviance and nondirected violence".&lt;ref name="Westermeyer 798-804" /&gt;  However, these symptoms are not confined to culturally bound syndromes, as others, such as "[[personality disorder]], [[neurasthenia]], crisis/judgment disorders, [[organic brain syndrome]]s, [[drug]]-induced [[delirium]], major [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[mania]], [[schizophreniform]] and [[schizophrenia]]" might constitute the true psychiatric diagnosis."&lt;ref name="Westermeyer 798-804" /&gt; Because of these cross-cultural symptoms, it is argued that these syndromes are not necessarily unique ".&lt;ref name="Westermeyer 798-804" /&gt; and that applying the term ‘culturally bound’ to them hampers science’s ability to explore them on the same level as other [[psychological problem]]s.&lt;ref name="Ruiz CPH"&gt;{{Cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|title=Cultural Politics and Health: the Development of Intercultural Health Policies in the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua|url=http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-12062006-174845/unrestricted/Edgardo_Ruiz_ETD2006.pdf|last=Ruiz|first=Edgardo|year=1999|publisher=[[University of Puerto Rico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of these symptoms are sporadic and epidemic."&lt;ref name="Westermeyer 798-804" /&gt; Some culturally bound syndromes, in addition to grisi siknis, include:

Although grisi siknis behaves like a virus, researchers have not been able to trace anything irregular in the blood samples of victims.

According to the American Psychiatry Association, pibloktoq, "frenzy" witchcraft, chakore and amok, are all, like grisi siknis, classified as "running" syndromes, in that they contain "sudden high-level activity, [a] trance-like state, potentially dangerous behavior in the form of running [and] exhaustion, sleep [and/or] amnesia".&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/&gt; It is generally applied to purposeless roving.&lt;ref name="Mezzich, Juan E 1996"/&gt;

In addition, Dr. Richard Castillo, as quoted by Dr. C. George Boeree, believes that amok (with very similar symptoms to grisi siknis), pibloktoq, latah, "falling out", "indisposition", and the "fits" are all related to impulse control disorders, and thus are associated with [[trichotillomania]], compulsive gambling, pyromania, and kleptomania in Western medicine.&lt;ref name = "Boeree DD" /&gt;

== Grisi siknis in relation to Western medicine ==

According to the American Psychiatric Association, a Western medical condition similar in many aspects to culturally bound syndromes, particularly the "running" syndromes, of which grisi siknis is part, is dissociative (or psychogenic) fugue.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/&gt; In any fugal state, a person appears normal, but has amnesia or identity forgetfulness.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/&gt; Dissociative fugue is distinguished by impulsive travel and amnesia, identity uncertainty, stress, and impediment to normal social function, all of which must not be influenced by substance intake.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/&gt; It is most often related to intense emotional stress and occurs randomly.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/&gt; However, some argue that "running" syndromes are really not dissociative fugue, and have no proper Western medical classification.&lt;ref name="Mezzich, Juan E 1996"/&gt; Others contend that associating culturally bound symptoms with known ailments severely limits the discovery of new psychiatric disorders in folk culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guarnaccia |first1=Peter J. |last2=Rogler |first2= Lloyd H.|title=Research on Culture-Bound Syndromes: New Directions |journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=156 |issue=9 |pages=1322–7 |date=1 September 1999 |pmid=10484940 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=156&amp;page=1322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edgardo Ruiz, PhD at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] argues that grisi siknis does not correlate with Western scientific cultural perspectives, and the cross-cultural translation of symptoms is an inaccurate device wherewith to understand the disease.&lt;ref name="Ruiz CPH" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Miskito theories ===

Miskito tradition, according to Dennis, holds that grisi siknis is caused by possession by evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; This belief stems from the combination of traditional Native American animism.&lt;ref name=Focosi /&gt; and Miskito Christian idea of the devil.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; When epidemic outbreaks of the disease occur, the Miskito hold that it is the result of an imbalance with spirits, says Nicola Ross, a reporter for ''The Walrus'' magazine,&lt;ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/&gt; which predicament they believe to be caused by a dilman or evil sorcerer.&lt;ref name=Focosi /&gt;

=== Western theories ===

There is no definitively known cause of grisi siknis, although there are some theories which attempt to explain its origin. Although it has not discovered organic cause, says Dennis, grisi siknis still "follow[s] the classic model for contagious disease".&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; Dennis claims that grisi siknis is the source of the emotionally volatile Miskito culture, saying "it is clear that grisi siknis is related to emotional upset, worry, fear and general anxiety", while microorganisms, if involved, are intermediate.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; Dr. Ronald C. Simons, professor emeritus of psychiatry and anthropology at [[Michigan State University]], as quoted by Nicola Ross in ''[[The Walrus]]'' magazine, upholds this argument, proposing that grisi siknis is caused by poverty and stress among the Miskito.&lt;ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/&gt; Culturally bound syndromes, Simons says, are often strongly influenced by behavior and experience and have become a local way of expressing misfortune.&lt;ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/&gt; Dr. Wolfgang Jilek, of the [[University of Columbia]]’s psychiatry department, also quoted by Ross in ''The Walrus'', calls culturally bound syndromes "real" despite a general lack of evidence for organic causes.&lt;ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/&gt; They are primarily the result of trauma and stress, Jilek claims, that end in mental dissociation problems.&lt;ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/&gt; Susan Kellogg, Associate Professor and Chair of the History Department at the [[University of Houston]], says that grisi siknis is the result of the cultural "physical and emotional stresses" that Miskito women endure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellogg|first=Susan|title=Weaving the Past: a History of Latin America's Indigenous Women from the Prehispanic Period to the Present|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[New York, NY]], United States|isbn=9780195183283|oclc=318402613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shlomo Ariel, Co-Director of the [[Integrative Psychotherapy Center]] in [[Ramat Gan]], Israel, says that such disorders are the product of the culture, delineates  acceptable coping mechanisms for dealing with external or internal changes.&lt;ref name="Ariel, Shlomo 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ariel|first=Shlomo|title=Culturally Competent Family Therapy: a General Model|series=Contributions in Psychology|volume=37|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=[[Westport, CT]], United States|isbn=9780313310799|oclc=756506493|issn=0736-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical homeostatic function, Ariel says, "emotional or behavioral disorders in the individual are defined as such by the culture", which culture subsequently imposes treatment in order to restore equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Ariel, Shlomo 1999"/&gt; Grisi siknis can be considered a ritualized behavior associated with the adolescent to adult transition  among the Miskito, says Mark Jamieson, professor of social anthropology at the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name="Jamieson 257-72"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jamieson|first1=Mark|title=Mask and madness. Ritual expressions of the transition to adulthood among Miskitu adolescents|journal=Social Anthropology|volume=9|issue=3|date=October 2001|pages=257–272|issn=0964-0282|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8676.2001.tb00152.x|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/7170/1/7170.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls in Miskito culture, claims Jamieson, are faced with the culturally inconsistent task of attracting a husband sexually while remaining safe and pure to maintain societal status quo.&lt;ref name="Jamieson 257-72" /&gt; The contradictory familial pressures to both protect and marry off the daughter adds to this.&lt;ref name="Jamieson 257-72" /&gt; Thus, says Shlomo, "the syndrome may be viewed as a safety valve" to maintain equilibrium between these conflicting pressures.&lt;ref name="Ariel, Shlomo 1999"/&gt; Miskito girls express transitional sexuality through the syndrome while maintaining social purity, with the culture holding the victims blameless for their actions while attacked by the disease.&lt;ref name="Ariel, Shlomo 1999"/&gt;

== Cures ==

Grisi siknis is generally only cured by traditional Miskito healing methods, according to ''The Journal of the American Botanical Council''.&lt;ref name ="Herbs and Healing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=B.|title=Herbs and healing on Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast|journal=HerbalGram|volume=41|date=Fall 1997|pages=35–48|location=[[Austin, TX]], United States|publisher=American Botanical Council|issn=0899-5648}}&lt;/ref&gt; In treating the ailment, the Miskito typically follow a hierarchy of remedies, turning first to home-based remedies, second to modern health facilities and finally to [[curandero]] or witch doctors, the latter particularly, if evil spirits are believed to be involved.&lt;ref name ="Herbs and Healing" /&gt; These healers use an assortment of vapor baths, anointing, teas and potions, all of which are organically derived.&lt;ref name ="Herbs and Healing" /&gt; According to Dennis, the Miskito healers use a variety of undisclosed steamed herbal remedies that are generally more successful than any Western medicine.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt; However, the cures can be counteracted, Dennis says, by exposure to dead people, pregnant women and various meats.&lt;ref name="Dennis 445-505" /&gt;

== Notable cases ==

Cases of grisi siknis were registered in [[Nicaragua]] in March 2009 in [[Puerto Cabezas]] and [[Siuna]] where many students of the National Institute of Technology and other schools, suffered attacks. Most of the victims were girls. The Miskito people argued that it was due to the action of black sorcerers to oblige the people to pay the expensive cures. Some scholars in the country conclude that it is due to the extreme poverty that the Miskito people endure and that was worsened by [[Hurricane Felix]] of September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[EFE]]|url=http://caracol.com.co/nota.aspx?id=781724|title=Brote de locura colectiva ataca a indígenas miskitos de Nicaragua|publisher=Caracol Radio|location=Bogotá|date=20 March 2009 |language=Spanish|accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Prensa: Gris siknis ataca otra vez en la RAAN, [[Managua]], 20 de marzo de 2009.

'''Interbellum Generation''' is a term (derived from the [[Latin]] ''inter'' "between" and ''bellum'' "war") that is sometimes used to denote persons born in the [[United States]] during the first decade of the 20th century, often expressed specifically as the years 1901 to 1913.  The name comes from the fact that those born during this time were too young to have served in the military during [[World War I]], and were generally too old to serve as enlisted personnel in [[World War II]], although many of them could indeed be found in the armed forces in some capacity during the later conflict.

Members of this generation came of age either during the [[Roaring Twenties]] or the initial phase of the [[Great Depression]], prior to the election of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the promulgation of the [[New Deal]].  This fact contributed to the core of this generation holding lifelong [[left wing|left]]-[[Liberalism|liberal]] views in politics, especially on economic issues, although a few prominent  dissenters (such as [[Barry Goldwater]]) do stand out.  Most of their children belong to the [[Silent Generation]].

The four [[Presidents of the United States]] of the Interbellum Generation were [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (born in 1908), [[Ronald Reagan]] (born in 1911) and [[Richard M. Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]] (both born in 1913). (However, Reagan, Nixon and Ford served in World War II with members of the [[G.I. generation|Greatest Generation]].)

Living members of this generation include [[Richard Arvine Overton]], the oldest living World War II veteran. For deceased celebrities born in this era, see [[G.I. Generation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5929">'''Interdiscourse''' is the implicit or explicit relations that a [[discourse]] has to other discourses. '''Interdiscursivity''' is the aspect of a discourse that relates it to other discourses. [[Norman Fairclough]] prefers the concept "orders of discourse". Interdiscursivity is often mostly an analytic concept, e.g. in Foucault and Fairclough. Interdiscursivity has close affinity to [[recontextualisation]] because interdiscourse often implies that elements are imported from another discourse.

The meaning of interdiscourse varies. It denotes at least three levels:

# In Courtine interdiscursivity means that ''a discourse has a relation to another discourse''. That is, a meaning which is close to the meaning of [[intertextuality]].
# In [[Norman Fairclough]] and Linell interdiscursive denotes ''relations between types of discourse'' such as genres.
# In [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Marc Angenot]], interdiscursive &lt;ref&gt;constellation/configuration interdiscursive, Foucault 1969: 88, 206-8&lt;/ref&gt; denotes ''relations between discursive formations'', that is, between large heterogeneous discursive entities, such as natural history and political economy during enlightenment. In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscourse is differences and equalities across [[discourse|discursive formations]].

An example (where 1. corresponds to a., etc.) illustrates the three levels: A minister of environment speaks in the parliament about a proposal.

*a. She refers to other specific speeches in the parliament about the proposal.
*b. She refers to a memorandum from her civil servants.
*c. She refers to scientific reports supporting the proposal.

The example illustrates that 2. and 3. are specific cases of 1, in the sense a-c all relate to another discourse. To avoid this, level 1. might be defined as relations to other discourses ''within'' the same discursive formation and type of discourse. Consequently, the definition of the levels depends on the definition of [[discourse|discursive formation]] and types of discourse, and the three levels may collapse to the extent that these concepts are not conceived. In short, the stratification of interdiscourse depends on the stratification of discourse.

==Power, ideology and interdiscursive configuration==

Level 2. and 3. may be conceived as particularly salient. This is explained in [[Marc Angenot]] and Bruce by reference to [[Bakhtin]]: In [[Bakhtin]]'s [[dialogism]], the utterance is the natural meaningful and finalised unit of speech, which others are supposed to respond to, that is, others ''interpret the utterance by situating it in a discursive context''. But, an utterance may be interpreted (contextualised) in various ways, and interdiscourse and interdiscursivity denote how certain such interpretations (and relations to other discourses) are socially more privileged than others. Since interdiscourse privileges certain interpretations, it has a close affinity to the concepts of [[ideology]], [[hegemony]] and [[power (sociology)]]. For Bakhtin/Voloshinov, signs are a reality that refracts another reality, that is, signs are ideological.&lt;ref&gt;Voloshinov 1973: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the embedding of a discourse in an interdiscourse is an ideological interpretation of the discourse.

In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscursivity is not bound to [[ideology]], but is a more open concept for analysing relations between [[discourse|discursive formations]], that is, mapping their interdiscursive configuration. Such analyses constitute a part of his [[discourse analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1969: 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The cogent and restrictive character of the interdiscourse is reflected in the concept of the ''primacy of interdiscourse''.&lt;ref&gt;Maingueneau 1991: 20&lt;/ref&gt; The interdiscourse is the sayable, the opposite of what cannot be enunciated (l'inénoncable). But, the interdiscourse has also primacy in the sense that it ''defines the relations between discursive entities (or formations) that are constitutive of the discursive entities''. What is acceptable discourse, is in many respects a matter of interdiscursivity at level 2 and 3, because the interdiscursive import and export relations constitute a worksharing between the discursive entities, and this frames what is acceptable discourse within each discursive entity: Generally, a discourse has little authority over what other discourses are assumed to speak of and will therefore accept imported form and content from the other discourses. On the other hand, when a discourse exports content to other discourses, there are expectations as to the exported form and content. Thus, the interdiscursive system shapes the discourses.

Gender and Dance in Modern Iran, Biopolitics on stage. Routledge publication, Volume: 5 Issue: 2, page:13&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Lurish dances''' include a range of [[folk dance]]s popular among different groups of [[Lur people]] which have formed, developed and transferred during the subsequent generations. They  usually include common [[Iranian dance]]s; Collective dances and [[quadrille]], the circular arrangement ([[circle dance]]), and the colorful clothing.&lt;ref&gt;ثابت زاده، منصوره.

==History==
Due to discovered objects and archeological excavations from Lurish-inhabited areas like Kozagaran, Tepe Giyan, Tepe Musiyan, CheghaMish and [[Kul-e Farah]], it is evident that dance history predates the [[Arian]] migrations inward the [[Iranian plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, Y.(2010) Dancing at the Dawn of Agriculture.University of Texas Publication, 346 pages, {{ISBN|9780292779969}}, Available online at: [https://books.google.de/books?id=50uCw0DcW_MC&amp;pg=RA1-PT387&amp;lpg=RA1-PT387&amp;dq=tepe+giyan+dance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yjhwbYtC26&amp;sig=j-u_l8j1Fo3tYQbFdtj-jj874r0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiep5nPxLDUAhWHtBQKHSgFBG0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tepe%20giyan%20dance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contenau, G and R. Ghirshman (1935).Fouilles du Tepe Giyan, Paris: Librairie Orientaliste Paul Geuthner. Contenson, H. de. 1967. Troisieme campagne a Tell&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs depicting three dancing persons on the [[pottery]] discovered and  dance portrays on the bronze flags of [[Luristan]] of the first millennium BC, musicians and musical instruments depicted on the petroglyphs in [[Kul-e Farah]] of [[Izeh]] and Cheghamish are the most prominent archaeological evidences showing the value and history of dance in these areas.

==Styles==
There are many dance styles common in Lurish-inhabited areas. The most prevalent Lurish dance styles are handkerchief dance, Chupi dances (SanguinSama; slow rhythm along with strike and [[fiddle]], Se-Pa (three steps) dance that is performed faster than SanguinSama, and Du-Pa (Two steps) dance that is the fastest and the most exciting performance), and the stick dance (Çubâzi or Tarka-bâzi)(like Jitterbug wood) which is a martial show.&lt;ref&gt;Elton Daniel and AliAkbar Mahdi, 2006, Culture and Customs of Iran, Westport,Greenwood Press, 210 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting ceremony dances, PaPoshtePa dances, Suwaruna and the mourning dances are of less popular dances. Mourning dances are performed while loved persons are died as [[Chamariuna]] among [[Feylis]] and also among [[Great Lur]] tribes ([[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiries]] and the [[Southern Lurs]]).

===Dasmâl-bâzi (Handkerchief dance)===
[[File:Lur handkerchief dancer, Mamasani, Iran.jpg|thumb|250px| Handkerchief dancers in a wedding ceremony, Mamasani, Iran|right]]
Handkerchief dance also known as scarf dance ([[Lurish language|Lurish]]:Dasmâl-bâzi) is a vibrant [[circle dance]] style. This dance style is more common among [[Southern Lurs]] and [[Bakhtiari people]]. This style is usually performed by both male and female persons and includes different performing styles like Ashtafi-manganâ. Men or women may dance and wave colorful scarves, called dastmâl. A dasmâl is held in each hand. In case of the philosophy, it is believed that these dances have originated in the actions the women do in their daily livelihood. As the dance rhythm increases slowly, each person may chooses patterns to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://home.earthlink.net/~rcfriend/video-2.htm|title = Dances of Iran, Robyn Friend|date = 2000|accessdate = October 17, 2014|website = |publisher = Neil Siegel|last = Siegel|first = Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtiyari Dances, CD Number [174], Published [05/08/2004], Collected &amp; Researched by: Mansureh Sabetzadeh, available online at:[http://www.mahoor.com/cd/Folk-Music-Original/Bakhtiyari-Dances-211.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ču-bâzi (Twig dance)===
Ču-bâzi or Chubazi (twig dance) is a special [[dance double]] that is performed in the  celebrations and joys by [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] and the [[southern Lurs]] and is inspired by the [[heroic]] battles.&lt;ref&gt;Elton Daniel and AliAkbar Mahdi, 2006, Culture and Customs of Iran, Westport,Greenwood Press, 210 pages&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually dance by two men, although sometimes is performed by the women too. One dancer (the defender) is equipped with a long heavy stick up to four or five feet long. The other (the attacker) whom holds a shorter flexible stick (tarka), has to attack the opponent only below the level of the knee. While the dance is accompanied by [[drum]] and [[karnâ]] (a horn music instrument), the defender is only allowed to escape the strike by leaping up in the air. The contributors change in turn till the protagaonists are specified.&lt;ref&gt;David Brooks, The enemy within: limitations on leadership in the Bakhtiari, in The Conflict of Tribes and State in Iran and Afghanistan, ed: Richard Tapper, London, 1983, pp 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The dancers are surrounded by female and male enthusiastic audiences whom cheer the winners by screams and whistles.

===Čupi (Choupi)===
[[File:A Feyli Lurish Čupi dancer.jpg|thumb|A Feyli Lur woman, performing Čupi dance]]
In [[Lurish language|Lurish]] dialects, mass dance styles that are mainly based on leg movements are said Čupi (چووپی, Choupi). Mixed male and female dancers hold hands to form rings, hearing the vibrant musics by musicians, they perform different styles of čupi. The leader performer (Sarčupi or Čupikeš) is a skillful dancer whose duty is to lead others and warm up them in accordance with dance music rhythms. Other performers should coordinate the movements and body rhythms with the leader. The dance usually starts with Sangin-Samâ rhythm which is performed slowly, following Sepâ (Three steps) the next rhythm with faster performing and soars when vibrant Dopâ (two steps) is performing. After a while, the dance concludes to Sangin-Samâ movements in a reversed trend.&lt;ref&gt;گژک, تارنمای اینترنتی تبار لر. [http://www.gezhek.ir/38«"رقص لری (چوپی)".»]. (۱۰ اردیبهشت ۱۳۹۴ )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;پایگاه خبری گلونی. [http://golvani.ir/1395/05/%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%B5%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%84%D9%8F%D8%B1%DB%8C/«"انواع رقصهای لری »]. (۲۳ مرداد ۱۳۹۵)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sangin-Samâ====
Sangin-samâ (also Sangin-sepâ or Samâ) is usually the first phase of Čupi mass dance style and includes gentle and slow movements. Performers, initially put their right foot in the form of a cross with left foot, then take it  and take two steps forward. Then they put the left foot with the tip of the toe and finally put it aside right foot. The hands bend from elbow and small fingers of dancers, in line with the shoulders, are tied among each other. It seems that each of the gestures and dance components of Sama, has a philosophy retrieved from thousands years of coexistence with humane and natural elements behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Mortezai Darikvand, Ali. [http://www.goftarema.ir/%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%84%D8%B1%DB%8C-%DA%AF%D9%81%D8%AA-%D9%88%DA%AF%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA/ "The Philosophy Behind the Lurish Samâ dance"], ''Goftare Mâ, Information Agency'', Tehran, 12 February 2016. Retrieved on 27 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sepâ====
[[File:Čupi Dance by Feyli Lurs in Sweden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Čupi Dance by Feyli Lurs in Sweden]]
In Čupi dance continuum, the second phase is Sepâ (three steps) which is performed faster and more dynamic than Sangin-Samâ in accordance with speeding up the music rhythm. Dancers start the dance with the right foot and take three steps forward. In Lurish dances, like most Iranian group dances, the start of the move is with the right foot. After removing the three steps, the dancers first bend the right leg and then the left foot. The dancers' hands in this dance are tied to each other and their shoulders rely on each other. The literal meaning of dance in [[Lurish language|Lurish]] (Dasgerta), is the bond between hands when dancing.

'''Metaphorical language''' is the use of a complex system of [[metaphor]]s to create a sub-language within a common language which provides the basic terms ([[verb]]s, [[preposition]]s, [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]]) to express metaphors.

People who over-expose themselves to environments atypical from their usual habits tend to develop understanding of new words and apply new meanings to existing words. Such sources could include: absorbing a native language spoken in a different dialects or countries, a language other than their own and fictional language from books, music, films and videogames.

People who are classified with Autistic Spectrum Disorder tend to communicate metaphorically rather than with common phrases. It is currently not known why they can do this, although they also express other abnormalities from level 1 and 2 psychedelic experiences.

==History==
Metaphorical language is a common feature of religious discussion, (for example [[midrash]] or medieval [[Roman Catholic]] "[[Commonplace book|common places]]" or modern [[biblespeak]]) wherein fluency in a religious text is often a prerequisite to participating fully in a conversation.  Not just [[conceptual metaphor]]s (part of every language) that express belief in analogy between generic concepts, but extremely specific metaphors involving [[proper name]]s or use of concrete nouns to express generics or processes.

The [[Tao te ching]] is considered by many to be almost entirely metaphorical. For example, change is usually expressed with the “water” character, not the “change” character. 

To the outsider, such terms in such combinations will likely seem [[esoteric]] or otherwise unintelligible.  Only by learning the underlying patterns of events that are considered important in the religion or ethical or political system, would one be able to comprehend what was said.  The religious text thus acts as a [[code book]].  Since many religious authorities believe in the self-evident truth of their [[doctrine]]s, a mere exposure to the [[truth]] in the book would tend to convert outsiders trying to learn the language.  However, use of such language is not confined to religious groups

Use of metaphorical language was historically common among [[secret society]] devotees, for instance the Chinese [[Tong (organization)|Tong]]s that resisted Imperial rulers, and even some modern [[troll organization]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73586">'''Mormon studies''' is the [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[list of academic disciplines|academic]] study of the [[beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|beliefs, practices]], [[Latter Day Saint movement#History|history]] and [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]] of those known by the term ''[[Mormon]]'' and [[list of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denominations]] belonging to the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] whose members do not generally go by the term "Mormon". The Latter Day Saint movement includes not only [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) but also the [[Community of Christ]] (CoC) and other groups, as well as those falling under the umbrella of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].

Before 1903, writings about Mormons were mostly orthodox documentary histories or [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] material. The first dissertations on Mormons, published in the 1900s, had a naturalistic style that approached [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormon history]] from economic, psychological, and philosophical theories. While their position within Mormon studies is debated, Mormon [[apologetics]] have a tradition dating back to [[Parley P. Pratt]]'s response to an anti-Mormon book in 1838.

The amount of scholarship in Mormon studies increased after World War II. From 1972–1982, while [[Leonard J. Arrington|Leonard Arrington]] was a [[Church Historian and Recorder|Church Historian]] in the history department, the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]] were open to Mormon and non-Mormon researchers. Researchers wrote detached accounts for Mormon intellectuals in the "New Mormon history" style. Many new publications started to publish history in this style, including [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'']], ''[[BYU Studies Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Woman's Exponent|Exponent II]]''. Some [[General authority|general authorities]] in the church did not like the New Mormon history style, and Arrington and his remaining staff were transferred to [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) in 1982, where they worked in the [[Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History]]. The institute continued to support scholarship in Mormon history until 2005, when the institute closed and employees transferred to the LDS Church Office Building. In the late 1980s and 1990s, several other incidents made BYU faculty reluctant to voice unorthodox ideas about church history. Around 1990, BYU professors were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]''. Two historians were [[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|excommunicated]] in 1993, probably for their published unorthodox views. ''BYU Studies'' and other LDS church-sponsored publishers published more "faithful" scholarship at this time. Presses outside of Utah started to publish more books in Mormon studies. 

Mormon scholars engaging in Mormon studies still feel they must be careful about what they write, especially if they work with material from the Church History Library archives. Non-Mormon scholars are often suspicious of Mormon scholars' work. This is gradually changing as Mormon scholars find employment outside of church-sponsored institutions. Universities without affiliation to the LDS Church have endowed chairs for Mormon studies. Emerging trends in "Newer" Mormon History are an increase in interdisciplinary work and women's history. The LDS Church History Department hired a women's history specialist in 2011 and has recently published books focusing on women's history. Blogs focusing on Mormon history have helped make Mormon history more accessible and provided a safe space for unorthodox ideas, although they may be superficial at times. 

==Pre-1903 writings about Mormons==
Before World War II, church histories were mostly either orthodox Mormon or anti-Mormon and written by faithful Mormons or hostile non-Mormons, respectively.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=504}} A few writers in the first era of church history (1830–1905) wrote about Mormons as a curiosity and focused on their peculiar ways.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=16}}

===Anti-Mormon literature===
Non-Mormons wrote for a non-Mormon public about how "primitive and dangerous" Mormons were in "extreme terms."{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|pp=199–200}}  [[Eber D. Howe]] published ''[[Mormonism Unvailed|Mormonism Unvailed, or a Faithful Account of that Singular Imposition and Delusion]]'' in 1834, which claimed that [[Sidney Rigdon]] was the original author of the [[Book of Mormon]] and that [[Joseph Smith]] was a "vile wretch." Howe included affidavits from people who knew Joseph Smith collected by ex-Mormon [[Doctor Philastus Hurlbut|Philastus Hurlbut]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=53–54}} The book influenced future anti-Mormon literature. (by La Roy Sunderland, [[John C. Bennett|John Bennett]], and John A. Clark).{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=55}} Origen Bacheler examined the Book of Mormon itself in ''Mormonism Exposed Internally and Externally'', arguing that the book was inconsistent with the Bible and was written by Joseph Smith himself.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=56–57}}

In the 1960s, ex-Mormons [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] continued that anti-Mormon tradition by reprinting anti-Mormon works in the [[public domain]] as well as important but unflattering documents from LDS history through Utah Light House Ministry. They published their own criticisms of the LDS church as well, which, unlike early anti-Mormon works, cite historical documents.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=60–62}} [[Ed Decker]], an excommunicated Mormon, made two anti-Mormon films: ''[[The God Makers]]'' (1982) and ''[[The God Makers II]]'' (1993). The films described Mormons as being a [[cult]], abusing women and children, manipulating news outlets, and practicing [[Satanism]]. ''The God Makers II'' received criticism from other anti-Mormons, including Jerald and Sandra Tanner, who stated it contained inaccuracies.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=62–63}}

===Official church records and early histories===
[[File:Andrew Jenson.jpg|thumb|Andrew Jenson wrote the LDS Biographical Encyclopedia]]
Official recorders have existed since Joseph Smith organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] on April 6, 1830. Church records continue to the present and are kept in the LDS church archives. The first official church history was published in 1842, when Smith and his associates began writing ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of Joseph Smith]]'' as an official diary of Joseph Smith. This history was published in [[Times and Seasons]] in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], and then in [[Deseret News]] and Latter-day Saints' [[Millennial Star]] up until 1863. ''History of Joseph Smith'' was followed by ''History of Brigham Young'', which was also published in Deseret News and Millennial Star over the next two years. Church Historians and their assistants edited the material, which was published in official publications.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=1–2}} [[Andrew Jenson]] made sizable contributions to documentary church history with the [[Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia]] (1901–36), Encyclopedic History of the Church (1941), and an unpublished "Journal History of the Church" containing over 1,500 scrapbooks filled with published and unpublished records of daily activities in the church.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=1–2}} Jenson made a special report on the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]], and parts of the report were not openly used until [[Massacre at Mountain Meadows|''Massacre at Mountain Meadows'']] (2008) by [[Richard E. Turley Jr.|Richard E. Turley]], [[Ronald W. Walker]], and [[Glen M. Leonard]].{{sfn|Walker|2008|p=25}}

The first historian to attempt to summarize Mormon history on a large scale was [[Edward Tullidge]], who wrote ''Life of Brigham Young: or Utah and Her Founders'' (1876), ''History of Salt Lake City'' (1886), and History of Northern Utah and Southern Idaho (1889). [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Hubert How Bancroft]] wrote ''History of Utah'' (1889) with the help of the Historian's Office.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}} Bancroft's history of Utah portrayed Mormons favorably. Critics say that he wasn't objective since he allowed LDS Church authorities to read the book before publication. Perhaps his favorable treatment was how he obtained access to the church records.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=144–145}} Expanding on Bancroft's history, [[Orson F. Whitney]] wrote ''History of Utah'' (1898–1904) in four volumes. [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] wrote ''Essentials of Church History'' in 1922. Most of these accounts combined various testimonies into a single narrative without questioning the validity of the eyewitnesses or other observers, especially those of church authorities.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}}

Mormons wrote accounts for other Mormons, often published in church-sponsored venues like ''[[Juvenile Instructor|The Juvenile Instructor]]'' and in church-published lesson manuals. These writings were written for a Mormon audience in order to support their existing beliefs. [[B. H. Roberts|Brigham H. Roberts]] was an associate editor of the ''Salt Lake Herald'' and while on a mission to England, was the editor of the ''[[Millennial Star|Millenial Star]]''. Upon returning to Utah, he became a [[General Authority]]. After an invitation from ''Americana'', Brigham H. Roberts wrote a chapter each month from 1909 to 1915 in what later became the ''[[Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]: Century One''.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|pp=199–200}} The history had some of the first historical analysis of events in church history.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=140}} It was serialized in Americana 1909–1915.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}} 

From 1830-1930, women were victims or symbols in historical accounts.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=1}} Church historians mentioned their suffering, but rarely mentioned them by name. Anti-polygamy tracts also described Mormon women in general terms, describing them as deluded or miserable.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=2}} In an effort to combat the way anti-polygamists portrayed Mormon women, Edward Tullidge and Eliza R. Snow compiled ''The Women of Mormondom'' (1877), a book that portrayed Mormon women as hardworking and independent in a combined history, biography, and theology. ''Heroines of Mormondom'' (1884) highlighted faithful Mormon women's lives. Women wrote short biographies of other women and recorded them in [[Woman's Exponent|''Women's Exponent'']] and through publications from the [[Daughters of the Utah Pioneers]].{{sfn|Erekson|2017|pp=3–4}}

==Early Mormon studies==
[[File:Great Basin Desert 3 by Earth's beauty site.jpg|thumb|Great Basin Desert]]
Early academic writers on Mormon topics had a "naturalistic" approach to history, using theory from economics, psychology, and philosophy to guide their study.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=155}} Richard Ely contributed to the professionalization of Mormon studies with his early dissertation "Economic Aspects of Mormonism" (1903). In the work, he praised Mormon irrigation and communalism as a good model of economic development.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=146–147}} He influenced [[Leonard J. Arrington|Leonard Arrington']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s interest in economics and Mormons.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=160}} Andrew Love Neff wrote "The Mormon Migration to Utah," which he finished in 1918 but had started over ten years earlier. He was interested in how Mormons helped colonize the West.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=19}} Mormon [[E. E. Ericksen|Ephraim Edward Ericksen]] wrote "The Psychological and Ethical Aspects of Mormonism" (1922) while studying at the University of Chicago. His dissertation, influenced by functionalist theory, argued that Mormonism was a product of conflicts with non-Mormons and harsh environments.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=147–148}} Lowry Nelson, also a Mormon, studied at the University of Wisconsin in the 1920s. He worked in agriculture and was dean of BYU's College of Applied Science and director of the Utah Agriculture Experiment stations. He wrote articles about how the Mormon village was designed to promote unity and sociability, which allowed Mormon settlers to colonize the Great Basin Desert. He left Utah in 1937.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=149–150}} [[Nels Anderson]] studied at the University of Chicago, and studied hobos in Utah, where he converted to Mormonism. His book ''Desert Saints'' (1944) recounted the history of saints in the St. George, Utah area.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=150–151}} Other scholars publishing on Mormonism from this time period include I. Woodbridge Riley, [[Walter Franklin Prince|Walter F. Prince]], Franklin D. Daines, Hamilton Gardner, Joseph Geddes, [[Feramorz Y.

In the 1950s after World War II, an increasing number of Mormons studied history professionally and wrote dissertations about Mormon history. Non-Mormon sociologist Thomas F. O'Dea wrote a dissertation entitled "Mormon Values: The Significance of a Religious Outlook for Social Action" after living in a rural Mormon farming village in New Mexico for six months and subsequently teaching at Utah State University.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=22}} This study of Mormon culture "stunned Mormon readers with its objectivity and sympathetic insight," according to Mormon scholar [[Richard Bushman]].{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=203}} [[Bernard DeVoto]], [[Dale Morgan|Dale L. Morgan]], [[Fawn M. Brodie|Fawn McKay Brodie]], Stuart Ferguson, and [[Juanita Brooks]] did not have graduate degrees in history, but made significant contributions to the foundations of Mormonism's "New History" movement.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=499–500}}{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=151–154}} Brodie wrote [[No Man Knows My History|''No Man Knows My History'']] (1945), which contemporary reviews praised as definitive and scholarly. Other LDS scholars, notably [[Hugh Nibley]], criticized Brodie's biography.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=499–500}} In 1950, Juanita Brooks, an educated Mormon housewife, published a scholarly book on the Mountain Meadows Massacre, which is well-researched and balanced even by contemporary standards. Brooks's Mormon neighbors did not like "the frankness" of her book.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=202}}

==Apologetics and polemics==
{{anchor|Apologetics}}
&lt;!--Please don't edit text within above anchor template. Thanks.--&gt;
{{see also|Apologetics#Mormonism|Criticism of Mormonism}}

Mormon scholars are divided on whether apologetics should be considered part of Mormon studies or not. Brian D. Birch argues that it should be a part of Mormon studies, as long as apologetic authors concede that their arguments are objective and subject to academic debate.{{sfn|Birch|2014}} Apologists write defensively, and view their polemical responses to criticism as a battle for their faith.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|pp=518–519}} [[Parley P. Pratt]] responded to ''Mormonism Unveiled'' in detail in his 1838 pamphlet ''Mormonism Unveiled: Zion's Watchman Unmasked and Its Editor Mr. L.R. Sunderland Exposed, Truth Vindicated, the Devil Mad, and Priestcraft in Danger!'' Pratt argued against Sunderland's character, quoting Hurlbut, who stated that Sunderland has a "notorious character."{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=69}}

Hugh Nibley's ''No Ma'am, That's Not History'' set a standard for apologetics to use academic language, and criticized Brodie's use of sources in her controversial biography of Joseph Smith, ''No Man Knows My History''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} The [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS) aimed to support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon and respond to criticism, and used Nibley's style{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} to counter research that contradicted the Book of Mormon's ancient origins.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=517}} FARMS collaborated with [[Deseret Book Company|Deseret Book]] to publish the complete works of Hugh Nibley starting in 1984.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} In 1997, LDS church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] invited FARMS to be officially affiliated at BYU, and in 2006 it was subsumed by the [[Neal A. Maxwell Institute of Religious Scholarship]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} In 2012, Daniel C. Petersen, the editor of ''[[FARMS Review]]'', started publishing a new journal called [[Interpreter (journal)|''Interpreter'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|title=The Role of Apologetics in Mormon Studies|date=December 14, 2012|url=http://www.mormoninterpreter.com/the-role-of-apologetics-in-mormon-studies/|work=Mormoninterpreter.com|accessdate=2013-09-04|authorlink=Daniel C. Peterson}} — Note: this is a reprint of Peterson's August 2012 FAIR speech "Of 'Mormon Studies' and Apologetics".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FairMormon|Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research]] (FAIR), a group including both laypeople and academics, attempts to answer criticisms of the Mormon faith.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=517}} in 2013, it changed its name to [[FairMormon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/about|title=About FairMormon – FairMormon|work=FairMormon|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some other Mormon "insiders" countered the Book of Mormon's ancient origins through the Smith-Pettit Foundation in Salt Lake City and George Smith's [[Signature Books]] publishing company. Signature Books published ''New Approaches to the Book of Mormon'' by Brent Metcalfe and ''American Apocrypha'' by Dan Vogel and Metcalfe.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=73–74}} These insider views of the Book of Mormon's origins were diverse. ''American Apocrypha'' described the Book of Mormon as a work of fiction reflecting its environment. Ostler argued that the Book of Mormon was partially inspired.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=75}} FARMS's responses were at times patronizing, and even descending into veiled name-calling in William Hamblin's 1994 critique of a Metcalfe essay.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=76–77}}

===Counter-apologetics===
{{see also|Counter-apologetics}}
In the 1990s and 2000s, [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] Carl Mosser and Paul Owen encouraged other Evangelicals to respond to Mormon apologetics. Evangelical [[Craig Blomberg|Craig L. Blomberg]] discussed whether or not Mormons were Christian with Mormon [[Stephen E. Robinson]] in ''How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and Evangelical in Conversation''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=79}} Richard Bushman encouraged fellow Mormon historians to be less defensive and more open to criticism, and also to do research on Mormon history from a consciously Mormon point of view.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=521}}

==New Mormon history==
In the 1960s, a new generation of Mormon scholars emerged. The publication of [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'']], the newly-established Mormon History Association, and the professionalization of LDS and RLDS history departments provided spaces for historians to do new research in Mormon topics.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=498–499}} RLDS scholars founded the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] in 1972.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In 1974, [[Claudia Bushman]] and [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]] founded the magazine ''[[Woman's Exponent|Exponent II]]''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=164}} The first issue of [[BYU Studies Quarterly|''BYU Studies'']] was published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard|title=An Economic Interpretation of the "Word of Wisdom"|journal=BYU Studies|date=1959|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/economic-interpretation-word-wisdom|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonard Arrington 1950s.jpeg|thumb|Leonard Arrington]]
Also in 1972, the LDS Church hired Leonard Arrington as their historian.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=501}} During Arrington's time as historian, Mormon and non-Mormon historians were allowed to access the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]]. Much of the research in the 1970s used these newly-available sources to examine church history, sometimes in great detail.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=502}} Leonard Arrington influenced important scholars of Mormon history, including [[Richard L. Jensen|Richard Jensen]], [[William G. Hartley|William Hartley]], and [[Ronald W. Walker|Ronald Walker]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=164}} In 1969, Jewish historian [[Moses Rischin]] named the increasing amount of Mormon scholarship "the New Mormon history."{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=203}} The "New Mormon History" movement included non-Mormons Thomas F. O'Dea, P.A.M. Taylor, [[Mario De Pillis]], Lawrence Foster, Community of Christ member Robert Flanders, and Mormon scholar Klaus Hansen.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=5}}{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} 

[[Maureen Ursenbach Beecher]] was a leading researcher in women's studies.{{sfn|Whittaker|2013}}{{sfn|Cope|2012|p=102}} In the 1970s women's biographies were published, but not integrated into larger narratives.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=2}} Other women hired by the Church Historical Department included Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Edyth Romney. Journals dedicated special issues to Mormon women, and the increased interest in Mormon women led to more publications focused on them. Scholars published biographies of Emma Smith, Eliza Snow, Emmeline B. Wells, and Amy Brown Lyman.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=5}} 

Some writers looked at Mormon women's history with the goal of restructuring historical narratives. Mormon feminist articles on Mormon history started with the special Summer 1971 issue of ''Dialogue'' on women's issues and continued in publications like ''Exponent II'' (starting in 1974), and ''Mormon Sisters: Women in Early Utah'' (1976), edited by [[Claudia Bushman]]. Beecher and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich edited another volume about Mormon women's history in ''Sisters in Sprit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective'' (1987). ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism'' (1992) was another milestone in feminist publications, and it encouraged Mormon women to be empowered by their history and "reclaim lost opportunities."{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=6}}

Most New Mormon historians were LDS.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=6}} Their audience was Mormon intellectuals{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=5}} and non-Mormons.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} They maintained their respect for the Mormon faith, admitted to flaws in people and policies, and avoided taking a defensive stance,{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} a tone which non-Mormon historian [[Jan Shipps]] wrote "made them seem more secular than they actually were."{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=504–505}} Mormon history by non-Mormons at this time had a similar detached tone.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} New Mormon historians often published with the [[University of Illinois Press]] in order to publish for an academic audience independent of the church.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=206}} Charles S. Peterson argued in ''The Great Basin Kingdom Revisited'' that Arrington took an exceptionalist view of Mormon history, which he then taught to other New Mormon Historians. This exceptionalist view was that they could believe in both secular history and orthodox Mormon views of the restoration.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=234–235}}

==LDS church reaffirms orthodoxy and New Mormon Faith Historians==
The LDS church stopped funding so much research and limited access to the church archives.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Apostle [[Ezra Taft Benson]] warned employees in the [[Church Educational System]] against New Mormon History in a 1976 speech. He said that writing history in a neutral style undermined "prophetic history."  [[Boyd K. Packer]]'s 1981 article, "The Mantle is Far, Far Greater than the Intellect" was published in ''BYU Studies.'' He wrote that contemporary historians were too eager to focus on the faults of church leaders and dismiss spiritual inspiration.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=215}} In 1982, historians from Arrington's department were transferred to Brigham Young University, where they were assigned to teach in the history department and worked in the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History.{{sfn|Anderson|2005}}

[[File:Carol C. Madsen (41596667191).jpg|thumb|Carol Cornwall Madsen]]
After Arrington's death in 1999, [[Ronald K. Esplin]] and [[Jill Mulvay Derr]] led the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History at BYU. [[Carol Cornwall Madsen]] led research in the Women's History Initiative at the institute, where she wrote an important biographical study of [[Emmeline B. Wells]].{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=512}} In 2001,{{sfn|Bushman|2009|137}} [[Richard Bushman]] retired from full-time teaching at [[Columbia University]] and was a research director at the Smith Institute.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=513}} [[Dean C. Jessee]] started editing Joseph Smith's papers in ''The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith''. The Smith Institute closed in 2005, and institute staff along with the Smith papers project moved to the [[Church Office Building]].{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=512}} The [[The Joseph Smith Papers|Joseph Smith Papers]] project, started by the LDS church in 2001, aimed to publish Joseph Smith's papers with rigorous accuracy, and was validated by the National Historic Public Records Commission.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=205}} 

[[Jan Shipps]] asserts that this reluctance to support new Mormon history was a response to the [[Mark Hofmann]] document forgeries. Also, some church authorities disliked the books and articles produced by the history department, which noted flaws as well as strengths of people in church history.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Shipps states that the increase in new converts to the LDS Church led General Authorities to emphasize the need for "palatable" versions of church history in museums and historic sites rather than in-depth articles in church-sponsored publications.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=511}} Mormon sociologist [[Armand Mauss]] argued that Mormonism was a struggle between remaining distinctive and assimilating to accepted American cultural practices; scholar Ronald Helfrich speculates that the change in General Authority's reception to Arrington's research was because they feared assimilating too much.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=218}} General interest in Mormon studies continued during the 1980s, with over 2,000 books, articles, and other material published on Mormon history during that decade.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} 

''BYU Studies'' and Deseret Books published more "New Mormon Faith Historians" after General Authority pushback against New Mormon History. One of these New Mormon Faith Historians was [[Louis C. Midgley|Louis Midgely]], who argued that from a relativist, postmodern theory, the Mormon view that the LDS Church had divine origins was just as valuable and valid as others. New Mormon Faith Historians said that the New Mormon scholars left faith out of their analyses.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=219–220}} Many were members of FARMS, and often saw writers of New Mormon History as the same as other anti-Mormons, even though most writers of New Mormon History were Mormon.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=221–222}} The difference between the New Mormon Faith Historians and New Mormon scholars was hard to define.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=219–220}} 

Along with Arrington's transfer and a subsequent increase in restrictions in the LDS Church Archives, several other incidents led to an intellectual chilling of Mormon history by Mormons in the 1990s.{{sfn|Schuessler|2012}} In 1992, Arrington wrote that "the church cannot afford to place its official stamp of approval on any 'private' interpretation of its past," and this kind of history must be not sponsored by the LDS Church.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=4–5}} In September 1993, the LDS church excommunicated the [[September Six]], which included two historians: [[Lavina Fielding Anderson]] and [[D. Michael Quinn]]. These excommunications served as a warning to other Mormon historians.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Quinn's excommunication was perhaps tied to his idea that Mormon women had been given the priesthood in 1843, which he published in an essay in ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=224–225}} In 2003, he was scheduled to give a speech at a conference at Yale which was co-sponsored by BYU, and BYU stated they would withdraw their funding if Quinn presented his paper. That same year, Quinn applied to work as a professor at the University of Utah and Arizona State University. He was not hired as a professor, possibly because of fears that LDS people in power would retaliate against the university.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=227–228}} In 1986, administrators were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or present at the [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] symposium; around 1990, BYU professors were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or ''Sunstone''.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|pp=40–41}} [[Eugene England]], one of the founders of ''Dialogue'' and then a professor at BYU, spoke out against these prohibitions. He was asked not to write for the ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' in 1990, and in 1998 he was asked to retire from BYU without justification. England saw this as stemming from his publicly anti-war stance, and for his attention to Mormon racism and sexism. He viewed his differences as a potential source of learning for himself and others. After retiring from BYU, he started one of the first Mormon studies programs at [[Utah Valley University|Utah Valley State College]]. According to a 1997 report by the [[American Association of University Professors]] on academic freedom at BYU, Alan Wilkins was questioned about his motives for contributing to ''Dialogue'' and ''Sunstone'' in a tenure review. The report also mentioned other incidents where BYU administration criticized speakers and articles for criticism of the church, among other complaints.{{sfn|Pratt|1997|p=63}} 

In 1997, [[Joanna Brooks]] argued that the goal of Mormon studies was to critically examine Mormonism, not to determine religious truths.{{sfn|Brooks|1997|p=135}} She postulated that Mormon studies done as a type of cultural studies will help scholars in the field feel less defensive and more productive.{{sfn|Brooks|1997|p=138}} Outside of Brigham Young University and Utah, the [[University of North Carolina Press]], [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], and the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] published books on Mormonism.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In the 2000s, Jan Shipps was a large influence on news articles about Mormons; often she is the only expert cited for an entire article.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In 2005, the National Endowment for the Humanities held a seminar at Brigham Young University on the bicentennial of Joseph Smith's birth.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=197}}  [[Terryl Givens]], a comparative literature scholar, analyzed discourse about the Book of Mormon in ''By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion'' in 2002. {{sfn|McLemee|2002}}

Mormon women's history has not been well-integrated in general histories. Arrington and Davis Bitton discussed women's issues in two chapters on marriage and sisterhood in ''The Mormon Experience'' (1992). ''The Story of the Latter-day Saints'' (1992) by James Allen and Glen Leonard mentioned women in the context of auxiliaries like Relief Society and Primary, plural marriage, suffrage, and the ERA. ''The Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History'' (2000) contained 435 entries about men, but only 64 about women, with three-quarters of the women receiving less than a page of description. Church publication ''Our Heritage'' (1996) only mentioned a few women. Women's history remained in a "separate sphere."{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=7–8}} ''Daughters in My Kingdom'' (2011), an official history of the Relief Society, is mostly used in women's meetings. Outside of Mormon history specialists, Mormon women are rarely mentioned.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=9}}

==Newer Mormon history==
Non-Mormon scholars are still often suspicious of LDS scholars' work.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=3}} That is gradually changing as non-Mormon scholars increase and universities not affiliated with the LDS Church have endowed chairs for Mormon studies.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=4}} [[Kathleen Flake]] is the first Richard L. Bushman Chair of Mormon Studies at [[University of Virginia]], and [[Patrick Q. Mason|Patrick Mason]] is the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California.{{sfn|Walker|2013}}

[[File:Church History Library in Salt Lake City.jpg|thumb|Church History Library in Salt Lake City]]
The Church History Library still restricts access to certain documents for most scholars. Scholars may self-censor their research for fear of losing access to documents from the Church History Library. Previous excommunications of Mormon historians give Mormon researchers the sense that they are being watched.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=4}} Scholars from various disciplines see the "New Mormon History" movement as ending, bring replaced by "Post New Mormon History" or "Newer Mormon History." This emerging movement is interdisciplinary and endeavors to place Mormon studies in a broader historical context, further eroding boundaries between disciplines.{{sfn|Newell|2013|pp=6–7}} Mormon women's history has not been well-integrated with other Mormon studies topics.{{sfn|Coles|2018}} Contemporary historians like [[R. Marie Griffith]], [[Grant Wacker]], and [[Robert Orsi]] encourage the use of interdisciplinary tools in Mormon studies.{{sfn|Cope|2012|p=100}}

Included in these interdisciplinary tools are oral histories. In 1972, an the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies was established at BYU, where Jessie L. Embry directed an extensive oral history project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=John |last2=Ainsworth |first2=GlendaLynn |last3=Casper |first3=Zann |last4=Balif |first4=Elizabeth |title=Charles Redd Center for Western Studies oral history project records|url=https://findingaid.lib.byu.edu/viewItem/MSS%207752 |website=findingaid.lib.byu.edu |publisher=L.

Bushman and her students started the Claremont Oral History collection in 2009, and papers using the oral history data were published in ''Mormon Women Have Their Say: Essays from the Claremont Oral History Collection''.{{sfn|Bushman|Kline|2013b}}

The LDS Church History Department hired a specialist in women's history in 2011, Kate Holbrook. She co-authored ''The First Fifty Years of Relief Society: Key Documents in Latter-Day Saint Women's History'' with Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Matthew J. Grow. Laurel Thatcher Ulrich said the book was "the most important work to emerge from a Mormon Press in the last 50 years." Jenny Reeder, specializing in 19th century women's history, was hired in 2013. Brittany Chapman Nash and Lisa Tait also specialize in women's history and work in the LDS Church history department. Nash works in public services and helps researchers to be aware of women's sources the archive offers. She co-authored ''Women of Faith in the Latter Days'' with [[Richard E. Turley Jr.|Richard Turley]]. Tait works on the web team, helping to add a "Women of Conviction" section to church history website.{{sfn|Walch|2016}} In 2017, Reeder and Holbrook edited a compilation of women's speeches called ''At the Pulpit: 185 Years of Discourses by Latter-day Saint Women.'' {{sfn|Walch|2017}}

==Blogs and Mormon studies==
The [[Mormon blogosphere]] influences Mormon studies. In 2011, Patrick Mason surveyed 113 Mormon blog readers who were also graduate students.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=13}} Most respondents viewed blogs as a way to democratize Mormon studies. Since blogs are independent from Church institutions, many felt that blogs were a safe space to test more unorthodox ideas.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=17}} A few observed that men's voices are more prominent in the blogging community, though a few prominent blogs have all-women authors.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=18}} Other respondents felt that blogs made Mormon studies "more of an echo chamber," and were "superficial," and "glorified navel-gazing."{{sfn|Mason|2012|pp=18–19}}  One of the most popular blogs, By Common Consent, had over two million page visitors in 2011. It and other blogs are influential on Mormon studies.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=20}}

== Archives ==
Archives with significant Mormon collections include the [[L. Tom Perry Special Collections]] at BYU, the Church Archives in Salt Lake, the J. Willard Marriott Library at the [[University of Utah]] in Salt Lake, Utah State University Libraries, and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=165}}

== Awards ==
Awards for writing or service in the field of Mormon studies are presented annually by scholarly societies.  The [[Mormon History Association]] (MHA) and the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] (JWHA) each present annual awards for various categories within Mormon history, such as books, biographies, documentary history, journal articles, and lifetime achievement.&lt;ref name=mha_awards&gt;{{cite web | title=MHA Awards | work=mormonhistoryassociation.org | publisher=Mormon History Association | url=https://www.mormonhistoryassociation.org/awards | accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Awards | work=jwha.info | publisher=John Whitmer Historical Association | url=http://www.jwha.info/awards | accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The MHA also gives awards for theses and student papers.&lt;ref name=mha_awards/&gt;  The [[Utah State Historical Society]] (USHS), which frequently engages Mormon history, also presents awards for books, articles, and student papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NEWS: Utah State History Announces 2013 Annual Awards | date=September 17, 2013 | work=Utah Cultural Alliance: Unifying Utah's Cultural Community | url=http://ut-cultural-alliance.blogspot.com/2013/09/news-utah-state-history-announces-2013.html

== Academic programs ==
Several universities have programs in the study of Mormonism, with professors named to oversee coursework, research, and events on Mormon studies.  While independent academic programs have emerged in recent years, devotional religious education programs have existed far longer.  Additional colleges have also taught courses on Mormonism without having institutionally sponsored programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Series: Mormon Studies in the Classroom | author=Benjamin Park | date=April 21, 2014 | work=Juvenile Instructor | url=http://juvenileinstructor.org/new-series-mormon-studies-in-the-classroom/ | accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not included in the list below.

'''The nature–culture divide''' refers to a theoretical foundation of contemporary [[anthropology]]. Early{{clarify|date=March 2015}} anthropologists sought theoretical insight from the perceived tensions between [[nature]] and [[culture]]. Later, the argument became framed by the question of whether the two entities function separately from one another, or if they were in a continuous [[wikt:biotic|biotic]] relationship with each other.

In eastern society nature and culture are conceptualized as [[dichotomous]] (separate and distinct domains of reference). Some consider culture to be "man's secret adaptive weapon"&lt;ref name=GS&gt;Greenwood, David J and William A. Stini (1977) ''Nature, Culture, and Human History'', New York: Harper and Row, 393–408&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|393}} in the sense that it is the core means of survival. 
It has been observed that the terms "nature" and "culture" that can not necessarily be translated into non-western languages,&lt;ref&gt;Strathern 1980&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Native American [[John Mohawk]]{{year needed|date=March 2015}} describing "nature"{{clarify|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--the Latin word? so he was trying to define the western term?--&gt; as "anything that supports life".&lt;ref name=MKN&gt;Nelson, Melissa K., 2008, ''Original Instructions: Indigenous Teachings for a Sustainable Future'', Rochester: [[Collective Heritage Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that small scale-societies can have a more symbiotic relationship with nature{{by whom|date=November 2015}}. But less symbiotic relations with nature are limiting small-scale communities' access to water and food resources.&lt;ref name=MKN/&gt; It was also argued that the contemporary Man-Nature divide manifests itself in different aspects of alienation and conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel (2014). "Sustainability and Contemporary Man-Nature Divide: Aspects of Conflict, Alienation, and Beyond", [[Consilience: The Journal of Sustainable Development]] 13(1), 125-146.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Greenwood and Stini argue that agriculture is only monetarily cost-efficient because it takes much more to produce than one can get out of eating their own crops,&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;{{rp|397}} e.g. "high culture cannot come at low energy costs".&lt;ref&gt;Braun and Castree 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s [[Sherry Ortner]] showed the parallel between the divide and [[gender role]]s with women as nature and men as culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sherry Ortner]] (1972) [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3177638?sid=21105641078311&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2 Is Female to Male as Nature is to Culture?], [[Feminist Studies]] 1(2): 5-31&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[nature]]-[[culture]] divide is deeply intertwined with the social versus biological debate, since it both are implications of each other. As viewed in earlier forms of [[Anthropology]], it is believed that [[genetic determinism]] de-emphasizes the importance of culture, making it obsolete. However, more modern views show that culture is valued more than nature because everyday aspects of culture have a wider impact on how the humans see the world, rather than just our genetic makeup. Older anthropological theories have separated the two, such as [[Franz Boas]], who claimed that social organization and behavior is purely the transmission of social norms and not necessarily the passing of hereditable traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Tony|date=2015-01-26|title=Cultural Studies and the Culture Concept|journal=Cultural Studies|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=546–568|doi=10.1080/09502386.2014.1000605|issn=0950-2386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using such a contrasting approach, more modern anthropologists see [[Neo-Darwinism]] as an outline for culture, therefore nature is essentially guiding how culture develops. When looking at adaptations. anthropologists such as Daniel Nettle believe that behavior associated with cultural groups is a development of genetic difference between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nettle|first=Daniel|date=2009|title=Beyond nature versus culture: cultural variation as an evolved characteristic|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/curl.pdf|journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume=15|pages=223–240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, he states that animals choose their mates based on their environment, which is shaped by directly by culture. More importantly, the adaptations seen in nature are a result of evoked nature, which is defined as cultural characteristics which shape the environment and that then queue changes in phenotypes for future generations. To put simply, cultures that promote more effective resource allocation and chance for survival are more likely to be successful and produce more developed societies and cultures that feed off of each other.

On the other hand, transmitted culture can be used to bridge the gap between the two even more, for it uses a trial and error based approach that shows how humans are constantly learning, and that they use [[Social learning theory|social learning]] to influence individual choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mortenson|first=Erik|date=2011|title=Bridging the Nature/Culture Divide|url=https://topia.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/topia/article/download/40278/36426|journal=Topia|volume=33|pages=254–257|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen best about how the more superficial aspects of culture still are intertwined with nature and generic variation. For example, there are [[beauty standards]] intertwined into culture because they are associated with better [[survival rate]]s, yet they also serve personal interests which allows for individual breeding pairs to understand how they fit into society. Additionally, cultural lags dissolve because it is not sustainable for reproduction, and cultural norms that benefit biology continue to persevere. By learning from each other, nature becomes more intertwined with culture since they reinforce each other.

Since nature and culture are now viewed as more intertwined than ever before, which makes the divide between the two seems obsolete. Similarly, the social scientists have been reluctant to use biological explanations as explantations for cultural divisions because it is difficult to construct what what ‘biological’ explanations entail. According to social scientists like [[Émile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], anthropologists and especially sociologists have tended to characterize biological explanations in only a physiological and cognitive sense within individuals, not in a group setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowring|first=Finn|date=2015-05-07|title=The individual and society in Durkheim|journal=European Journal of Social Theory|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=21–38|doi=10.1177/1368431015585042|issn=1368-4310|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/72258/1/Bowring_Durkheim%20paper_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is a heavier focus on the social determinism as seen in human behavior instead. Furthermore, even as divide between nature and culture has been narrowed there is a reluctance to define biological determinism on a large scale.

The '''origin of speech''' refers to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]] in the context of the physiological
development of the human [[speech organs]] such as the   [[tongue]], [[lip]]s and [[Place of articulation|vocal organs]] used to produce [[Phoneme|phonological units]] in [[human universal|all human languages]].

==Background==
Although related to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]], the [[evolution]] of distinctively human [[speech]] capacities has become a distinct and in many ways separate area of scientific research.&lt;ref name="Hockett 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F. | author1link = Charles F.

Speech is in this sense optional, although it is the default modality for language.[[Image:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|250px|Places of articulation (passive and active):&lt;br /&gt;1.

Uncontroversially, monkeys, apes and humans, like many other animals, have evolved specialised mechanisms for producing ''sound'' for purposes of social communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kelemen, G. (1963).

The term ''[[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]'' means the chosen representational format for encoding and transmitting information. A striking feature of language is that it is ''modality-independent.'' Should an impaired child be prevented from hearing or producing sound, its innate capacity to master a language may equally find expression in signing. Sign languages of the deaf are independently invented and have all the major properties of spoken language except for the modality of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, W. C. 1960.

This feature is extraordinary. Animal communication systems routinely combine visible with audible properties and effects, but not one is modality-independent. No vocally impaired whale, dolphin or songbird, for example, could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, in the case of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from intrinsic properties of the signal.

Modality independence should not be confused with the ordinary phenomenon of multimodality. Monkeys and apes rely on a repertoire of species-specific "gesture-calls"&amp;nbsp;— emotionally expressive vocalisations inseparable from the visual displays which accompany them.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burling | first1 = R | year = 1993 | title = Primate calls, human language, and nonverbal communication | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 25–53 | doi=10.1086/204132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans also have species-specific gesture-calls&amp;nbsp;— laughs, cries, sobs and so forth&amp;nbsp;— together with involuntary gestures accompanying speech.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, D. 1992. ''Hand and Mind. What gestures reveal about thought.'' Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many animal displays are polymodal in that each appears designed to exploit multiple channels simultaneously.

The human linguistic property of "modality independence" is conceptually distinct from this. It allows the speaker to encode the informational content of a message in a single channel, while switching between channels as necessary. Modern city-dwellers switch effortlessly between the spoken word and writing in its various forms&amp;nbsp;— handwriting, typing, e-mail and so forth. Whichever modality is chosen, it can reliably transmit the full message content without external assistance of any kind. When talking on the telephone, for example, any accompanying facial or manual gestures, however natural to the speaker, are not strictly necessary. When typing or manually signing, conversely, there's no need to add sounds. In many Australian Aboriginal cultures, a section of the population&amp;nbsp;— perhaps women observing a ritual taboo&amp;nbsp;— traditionally restrict themselves for extended periods to a silent (manually signed) version of their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kendon, A. 1988. ''Sign Languages of Aboriginal Australia.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, when released from the taboo, these same individuals resume narrating stories by the fireside or in the dark, switching to pure sound without sacrifice of informational content.

==Evolution of the speech organs==
[[Image:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal tract]]
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. Humans' first recourse is to encode our thoughts in sound&amp;nbsp;— a method which depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus.

The speech organs, everyone agrees, evolved in the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The evolution of speech: a comparative review. | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 258–267 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01494-7 | pmid = 10859570 | url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic151491.files/Fitch2000TICS.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apes use their highly flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing.   When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006" /&gt; ''Either'' it is performing gymnastics with its tongue ''or'' it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, ''Homo sapiens'' is exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion to the radically different requirements of articulate speech.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, Peter, 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tongue===
[[Image:Spectrogram -iua-.png|250px|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of American English vowels {{IPA|[i, u, ɑ]}} showing the formants ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
The word "language" derives from the Latin ''lingua,'' "tongue". Phoneticians agree that the tongue is the most important speech articulator, followed by the lips. A natural language can be viewed as a particular way of using the tongue to express thought.

The human tongue has an unusual shape. In most mammals, it's a long, flat structure contained largely within the mouth. It is attached at the rear to the [[hyoid bone]], situated below oral level in the [[pharynx]]. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended [[pharynx]], where it is attached to a hyoid bone in a lowered position. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). As we move our jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly. That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''', which nonhuman primates cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = P. | last2 = Crelin | first2 = E.

N. 1972. The quantal nature of speech: Evidence from articulatory-acoustic data. In P. B. Denes and E. E. David, Jr. (eds.), ''Human Communication: A unified view.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, pp. 51–66.&lt;/ref&gt; It may not be coincidental that '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''' are the most common vowels in the world's languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Malden: MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lips===
In humans, the lips are important for the production of [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]], in addition to [[vowel]]s. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons. During primate evolution, a shift from nocturnal to diurnal activity in [[tarsier]]s, monkeys and apes (the [[Haplorhini|haplorhines]]) brought with it an increased reliance on vision at the expense of olfaction. As a result, the snout became reduced and the [[rhinarium]] or "wet nose" was lost. The muscles of the face and lips consequently became less constrained, enabling their co-option to serve purposes of facial expression. The lips also became thicker. "Hence", according to one major authority, "the evolution of mobile, muscular lips, so important to human speech, was the exaptive result of the evolution of diurnality and visual communication in the common ancestor of haplorhines".&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. 2012. The anatomical and physiological basis of human speech production: adaptations and exaptations. In M. Tallerman and K. .Gibson (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether our lips have undergone more recent adaptation to the specific requirements of speech.

===Respiratory control===
Compared with nonhuman primates, humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak. While we are speaking, intercostal and interior abdominal muscles are recruited to expand the thorax and draw air into the lungs, and subsequently to control the release of air as the lungs deflate. The muscles concerned are markedly more innervated in humans than in nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. M. (1993). The vertebral canal. In A. Walker and R. Leakey (eds.), ''The Nariokotome ''Homo erectus'' skeleton.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 359–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from fossil hominins suggests that the necessary enlargement of the vertebral canal, and therefore spinal cord dimensions, may not have occurred in ''Australopithecus'' or ''Homo erectus''  but was present in the Neanderthals and early modern humans.&lt;ref name="MacLarnon 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=MacLarnon AM, Hewitt GP |title=The evolution of human speech: the role of enhanced breathing control |journal=Am.

===Larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.&lt;ref name="Fitch.

[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of the larynx, [[anatomical terms of location|anterolateral]] view]]

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs&amp;nbsp;— increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food&amp;nbsp;— we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit&amp;nbsp;— so it is claimed&amp;nbsp;— must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135| pmc = 3338724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech.

At least one [[orangutan]] has demonstrated the ability to control the voice box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orangutan's Vocal Feats Hint At Deeper Roots of Human Speech |author=Jon Hamilton |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/14/518170608/orangutans-vocal-feats-hint-at-deeper-roots-of-human-speech |date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"&amp;nbsp;— giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Could the Neanderthals speak?===
[[File:Gray186.png|thumb|Hyoid bone&amp;nbsp;— anterior surface, enlarged]]
[[File:Gray1194.png|thumb|Anterolateral view of head and neck]]

Most specialists credit the Neanderthals with speech abilities not radically different from those of modern ''Homo sapiens''. An indirect line of argument is that their tool-making and hunting tactics would have been difficult to learn or execute without some kind of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn &amp; Coolidge, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; A recent extraction of [[DNA]] from Neanderthal bones indicates that Neanderthals had the same version of the [[FOXP2]] gene as modern humans. This gene, once mistakenly described as the "grammar gene", plays a role in controlling the orofacial movements which (in modern humans) are involved in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nicholas |last=Wade |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date=19 October 2007 |title=Neanderthals Had Important Speech Gene, DNA Evidence Shows |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/science/19speech-web.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, it was widely believed that the Neanderthals lacked modern speech capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Philip |last=Lieberman |author2=Edmund S. Crelin |date=Spring 1971 |title=On the Speech of Neanderthal Man |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=203–222 |doi= |doi-broken-date=22 May 2009 |jstor=4177625}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that they possessed a hyoid bone so high up in the vocal tract as to preclude the possibility of producing certain vowel sounds.

The hyoid bone is present in many [[mammal]]s. It allows a wide range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order to produce variation.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the larynx in chimpanzee infants. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100 | issue = 12 | pages = 6930–3 | date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1231107100 | pmid = 12775758 | pmc = 165807}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now realised that its lowered position is not unique to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', while its relevance to vocal flexibility may have been overstated: although men have a lower larynx, they do not produce a wider range of sounds than women or two-year-old babies.

The hypoglossal nerve plays an important role in controlling movements of the tongue.

==Origin of speech sounds==

===Distinctive features theory===
{{IPA vowels|class=infobox}}
According to one influential school,&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R., Gunnar, C., Fant, M. and Halle, M. 1952. ''Preliminaries to Speech Analysis.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. and M. Halle 1956. ''Fundamentals of Language.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; the human vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital on the model of a keyboard or digital computer. If so, this is remarkable: nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard, notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This poses the question as to when and how, during and the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred.

The human supralaryngeal tract is said to be digital in the sense that it is an arrangement of moveable toggles or switches, each of which, at any one time, must be in one state or another. The vocal cords, for example, are either vibrating (producing a sound) or not vibrating (in silent mode). By virtue of simple physics, the corresponding [[distinctive feature]]&amp;nbsp;— in this case, "voicing"&amp;nbsp;— cannot be somewhere in between. The options are limited to "off" and "on". Equally digital is the feature known as "[[Nasalization|nasalisation]]". At any given moment the [[soft palate]] or velum either allows or doesn't allow sound to resonate in the nasal chamber. In the case of lip and tongue positions, more than two digital states may be allowed. '''(To experiment with this, click on [http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~danhall/phonetics/sammy.html Interactive Saggital Section]).'''

The theory that speech sounds are composite entities constituted by complexes of binary phonetic features was first advanced in 1938 by the Russian linguist [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1938. "Observations sur le classement phonologiques des consonnes", in ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress of Phonetic Sciences,'' Ghent.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent early supporter of this approach was [[Noam Chomsky]], who went on to extend it from phonology to language more generally, in particular to the study of syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1964 [1962]. The logical basis of linguistic theory. In H.G. Lunt (ed.), The Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Linguists. The Hague: Mouton, pp. 914-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. and Halle, M. 1968. ''The Sound Pattern of English.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1965 book, ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax,''&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 148-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky treated semantic concepts as combinations of binary-digital atomic elements explicitly on the model of distinctive features theory. The lexical item "bachelor", on this basis, would be expressed as [+ Human], [+ Male], [- Married].

Supporters of this approach view the vowels and consonants recognised by speakers of a particular language or dialect at a particular time as cultural entities of little scientific interest. From a natural science standpoint, the units which matter are those common to ''Homo sapiens'' by virtue of our biological nature. By combining the atomic elements or "features" with which all humans are innately equipped, anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future. The distinctive features are in this sense atomic components of a universal language.

====Criticism====
In recent years, the notion of an innate "universal grammar" underlying phonological variation has been called into question. The most comprehensive monograph ever written about speech sounds, ''Sounds of the World's Languages,'' by [[Peter Ladefoged]] and [[Ian Maddieson]],&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; found virtually no basis for the postulation of some small number of fixed, discrete, universal phonetic features. Examining 305 languages, for example, they encountered vowels that were positioned basically everywhere along the articulatory and acoustic continuum. Ladefoged concludes that phonological features are not determined by human nature: "Phonological features are best regarded as artifacts that linguists have devised in order to describe linguistic systems."&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. 2006. Features and Parameters for Different Purposes. http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/PLfeaturesParameters.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Self-organization theory===
[[Image:Fugle, ørnsø 073.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Birds flocking, an example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]]]]

[[Self-organization]]  characterizes systems where macroscopic structures are spontaneously formed out of local interactions between the many components of the system.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Oudeyer | first1 = Pierre-Yves | title = Self-organization in the evolution of speech | date = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford University Press; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-928915-8 | oclc = 65203001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In self-organized systems, global organizational properties are not to be found at the local level. In colloquial terms, self-organisation is roughly captured by the idea of "bottom-up" (as opposed to "top-down") organisation. Examples of self-organized systems range from ice crystals to galaxy spirals in the inorganic world, and from spots on the leopard skins to the architecture of termite nests or shape of a flock of starlings.
[[Image:TermiteMound.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A termite mound (Macrotermitinae) in the Okavango Delta just outside [[Maun, Botswana|Maun]], [[Botswana]]]]

According to many phoneticians, the sounds of language arrange and re-arrange themselves through self-organization&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, B., MacNeilage, P. and Studdert-Kennedy, M. 1984. Self-organizing processes and the explanation of language universals. In M. Butterworth, B. Comrie and Ö Dahl (eds), ''Explanations for language universals.'' Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Co., pp. 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2005b. Self-organisation in language. In C. Hemelrijk (ed.), ''Self-organisation and evolution of social systems.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 123–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Speech sounds have both perceptual ("how you hear them") and articulatory ("how you produce them") properties, all with continuous values. Speakers tend to minimise effort, favouring ease of articulation over clarity. Listeners do the opposite, favouring sounds which are easy to distinguish even if difficult to pronounce. Since speakers and listeners are constantly switching roles, the syllable systems actually found in the world's languages turn out to be a compromise between acoustic distinctiveness on the one hand, and articulatory ease on the other.

How, precisely, do systems of vowels, consonants and syllables arise? Agent-based computer models take the perspective of self-organisation at the level of the speech community or population. The two main paradigms here are (1) the iterated learning model and (2) the language game model. Iterated learning focuses on transmission from generation to generation, typically with just one agent in each generation.&lt;ref name="Hurford 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurford, J. R | first1 = J. R. |  title = Social transmission favours linguistic generalization.| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 324–352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the language game model, a whole population of agents simultaneously produce, perceive and learn language, inventing novel forms when the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steels | first1 = L | year = 1995 | title = A self-organizing spatial vocabulary | url = | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 319–332 | doi=10.1162/artl.1995.2.319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steels, L. and Vogt, P. 1997. Grounding adaptive language games in robotic agents. In P. Harvey and P. Husbands (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Artificial Life.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 474–482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several models have shown how relatively simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organize a system of sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Berrah A-R., Glotin H., Laboissière R., Bessière P., Boë L-J. 1996. From Form to Formation of Phonetic Structures: An Evolutionary Computing Pers- pective, in Proc. ICML 1996 Workshop on Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning, pp. 23-29, Bari, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as de Boer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Self-organization in vowel systems | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 441–465 | doi=10.1006/jpho.2000.0125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently reformulated using Bayesian theory,&lt;ref&gt;Moulin-Frier C., Laurent R., Bessière P., Schwartz J.-L., and Diard J. 2012 Adverse Conditions Improve Distinguishability of Auditory, Motor and Perceptuo- Motor Theories of Speech Perception: an Exploratory Bayesian Modeling Study. Language and Cognitive Processes, 27(7–8):1240–1263.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how a group of individuals playing imitation games can self-organize repertoires of vowel sounds which share substantial properties with human vowel systems. For example, in de Boer's model, initially vowels are generated randomly, but agents learn from each other as they interact repeatedly over time. Agent A chooses a vowel from its repertoire and produces it, inevitably with some noise. Agent B hears this vowel and chooses the closest equivalent from its own repertoire. To check whether this truly matches the original, B produces the vowel ''it thinks it has heard'', whereupon A refers once again to its own repertoire to find the closest equivalent. If this matches the one it initially selected, the game is successful, otherwise it has failed. "Through repeated interactions," according to de Boer, "vowel systems emerge that are very much like the ones found in human languages."&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2012. Self-organization and language evolution. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), 2012. ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 612-620.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different model, the phonetician [[Björn Lindblom]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom. B. 1986. Phonetic universals in vowel systems. In J. J. Ohala and J. J. Jaeger (eds.), ''Experimental Phonology.'' Orlando: Academic Press, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; was able to predict, on self-organizational grounds, the favoured choices of vowel systems ranging from three to nine vowels on the basis of a principle of optimal perceptual differentiation.

Further models studied the role of self-organization in the origins of phonemic coding and combinatoriality, that is the existence of phonemes and their systematic reuse to build structured syllables. [[Pierre-Yves Oudeyer]] developed models which showed that basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalizations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer P-Y. 2005. The Self-Organization of Speech Sounds, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 233(3), pp. 435–449.&lt;/ref&gt; These models also characterized how morphological and physiological innate constraints can interact with these self-organized mechanisms to account for both the formation of statistical regularities and diversity in vocalization systems.

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that speech was a relatively late development, evolving by degrees from a system that was originally gestural.

Two types of evidence support this theory:
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] minimise vocal signals in favour of manual, facial and other visible gestures in order to express simple concepts and communicative intentions in the wild. Some of these gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David &amp; Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found strong support for the idea that spoken language and signing depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuromotor Mechanisms in Human Communication |author=Kimura, Doreen |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-505492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A. J.|year=2002 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=76–80 |doi=10.1038/nn775 |pmid=11753419 |issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans spontaneously use hand and facial gestures when formulating ideas to be conveyed in speech.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. 1992. ''Hand and mind.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. (ed.) 2000. ''Language and gesture.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also, of course, many [[sign languages]] in existence, commonly associated with [[deaf]] communities; as noted above, these are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.

====Criticism====

Critics note that for mammals in general, sound turns out to be the best medium in which to encode information for transmission over distances at speed. Given the probability that this applied also to early humans, it's hard to see why they should have abandoned this efficient method in favour of more costly and cumbersome systems of visual gesturing&amp;nbsp;— only to return to sound at a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 222 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of explanation, it has been proposed that at a relatively late stage in human evolution, our ancestors' hands became so much in demand for making and using tools that the competing demands of manual gesturing became a hindrance. The transition to spoken language is said to have occurred only at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Corballis, M. C. 2002. Did language evolve from manual gestures? In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 161-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Since humans throughout evolution have been making and using tools, however, most scholars remain unconvinced by this argument. (For a different approach to this puzzle&amp;nbsp;— one setting out from considerations of signal reliability and trust&amp;nbsp;— see "from pantomime to speech" below).

==When did speech evolve?==
{{Human timeline}}
Little is known about the timing of language's emergence in  the human species. Unlike writing, speech leaves no material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern ''Homo'' species had speech ''capacities'', it is still unknown whether they actually spoke. While they may have communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages today, [[Johanna Nichols]]&amp;nbsp;— a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley&amp;nbsp;— argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998. The origin and dispersal of languages: Linguistic evidence. In Nina Jablonski and Leslie C. Aiello, eds., ''The Origin and Diversification of Language,''  pp. 127-70. (Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.) San Francisco: California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently&amp;nbsp;— in 2012&amp;nbsp;— anthropologists Charles Perreault and Sarah Mathew used phonemic diversity to suggest a date consistent with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e35289 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Phonemic diversity" denotes the number of perceptually distinct units of sound&amp;nbsp;— consonants, vowels and tones&amp;nbsp;— in a language. The current worldwide pattern of phonemic diversity potentially contains the statistical signal of the expansion of modern ''Homo sapiens'' out of Africa, beginning around 60-70 thousand years ago. Some scholars argue that phonemic diversity evolves slowly and can be used as a clock to calculate how long the oldest African languages would have to have been around in order to accumulate the number of phonemes they possess today. As human populations left Africa and expanded into the rest of the world, they underwent a series of bottlenecks&amp;nbsp;— points at which only a very small population survived to colonise a new continent or region. Allegedly such population crash led to a corresponding reduction in genetic, phenotypic and phonemic diversity. [[African languages]] today have some of the largest phonemic inventories in the world, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be colonized. For example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], a language of New Guinea, and [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes,&lt;ref&gt;Maddieson, I. 1984. ''Patterns of Sounds.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddieson | first1 = I. | last2 = Precoda | first2 = K. | year = 1990 | title = Updating UPSID | url = | journal = UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 104–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes.
The authors use a natural experiment&amp;nbsp;— the colonization of mainland Southeast Asia on the one hand, the long-isolated [[Andaman Islands]] on the other&amp;nbsp;— to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time. Using this rate, they estimate that the world's languages date back to the [[Middle Stone Age]] in Africa, sometime between 350 thousand and 150 thousand years ago. This corresponds to the speciation event which gave rise to ''Homo sapiens''.

These and similar studies have however been criticized by linguists who argue that they are based on a flawed analogy between genes and phonemes, since phonemes are frequently transferred laterally between languages unlike genes, and on a flawed sampling of the world's languages, since both Oceania and the Americas also contain languages with very high numbers of phonemes, and Africa contains languages with very few. They argue that the actual distribution of phonemic diversity in the world reflects recent language contact and not deep language history - since it is well demonstrated that languages can lose or gain many phonemes over very short periods. In other words, there is no valid linguistic reason to expect genetic founder effects to influence phonemic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hunley, Claire Bowern, and Meghan Healy ("Rejection of a serial founder effects model of genetic and linguistic coevolution", Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 2/1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011 Out of Africa?

==Speculative scenarios==

===Early speculations===
{{quotation|"I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries."|{{Citation|title=''Charles Darwin, 1871.'' The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.}}&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. London: Murray, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:&lt;ref&gt;Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''[[Bow-wow theory|bow-wow]]'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''Pooh-Pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise and so on.
* '''Ding-dong'''. Müller suggested what he called the ''Ding-Dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory saw language emerging out of collective rhythmic labour, the attempt to synchronise muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho''.
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max Müller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by [[Sir Richard Paget, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Paget]].&lt;ref&gt;Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experiments, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong&amp;nbsp;— they occasionally offer peripheral insights&amp;nbsp;— as comically naïve and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J. R. 1964. ''The Tongues of Men and Speech.'' London: Oxford University Press, pp. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. ''Inquiries into the origins of language.'' New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic. They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
From the perspective of modern science, the main obstacle to the evolution of speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is that symbols&amp;nbsp;— arbitrary associations of sounds with corresponding meanings&amp;nbsp;— are unreliable and may well be false.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 227–230 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1993.0061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the saying goes, "words are cheap".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J | year = 1994 | title = Must reliable signals always be costly? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1115–1120 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.

Animal vocal signals are for the most part intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. One can "trust" the signal not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just can't fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable,&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, K. 2012. Have we underestimated great ape vocal capacities? In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 90-95.&lt;/ref&gt; but they remain reliable for the same reason&amp;nbsp;— because they are hard to fake.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986" /&gt; Primate social intelligence is ''Machiavellian''&amp;nbsp;— self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive one another, while at the same time constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R. and A. Whiten (eds) 1988. ''Machiavellian Intelligence. Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, it is precisely primates' resistance to deception that blocks the evolution of their vocal communication systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt;

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favour of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.&lt;ref name="Power 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar feature of language is "displaced reference", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

==== "Kin selection" ====
The "mother tongues" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fitch| first1 = W. T.| title = Kin selection and "mother tongues" : a neglected component in language evolution | editors =  Ulrike Griebel; D Kimbrough Oller | work = Evolution of communication systems : a comparative approach | year = 2004 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-262-15111-5 |oclc = 845673575| pages = 275–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W.

I. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 |date=Jul 1964 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4| PMID = 5875341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964b"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = WD. | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

Fitch suggests that spoken languages were originally "mother tongues". If speech evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable vocal signals&amp;nbsp;— spoken words&amp;nbsp;— to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. Ape mothers also share genes with their offspring, as do all animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with non-kin. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited "mother tongue" networks from relatives to non-relatives remains unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;Tallerman, M. In press.

==== "Reciprocal altruism" ====

'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.'' In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you.'' Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, early society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

=====Criticism=====
Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom "obligatory reciprocal altruism" could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Knight|first1=Chris| title=Language co-evolved with the rule of law| editors = Angelo Cangelosi; Andrew D M Smith; Kenny Smith | work = The evolution of language : proceedings of the 6th international conference (EVOLANG6) , Rome, Italy, 12–15 April 200 | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey | isbn = 9789812566560 | oclc = 70797781| doi=10.1007/s11299-007-0039-1|url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.&lt;ref&gt;Dessalles, J.-L. 1998.

==== "Gossip and grooming" ====
Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]], does for group-living humans what manual [[Social grooming|grooming]] does for other primates&amp;nbsp;— it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances. As humans began living in larger and larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans invented "a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming"&amp;nbsp;— ''vocal grooming''.  To keep your allies happy, you now needed only to "groom" them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming (the production of pleasing sounds lacking syntax or combinatorial semantics) then evolved somehow into syntactical speech.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R. I. M. | title = Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780571173969 |oclc = 34546743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of "vocal grooming"&amp;nbsp;— that words are so cheap&amp;nbsp;— would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.&lt;ref name="Power 1998" /&gt; A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming&amp;nbsp;— the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds&amp;nbsp;— to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

According to another school of thought, language evolved from [[mimesis]]&amp;nbsp;— the "acting out" of scenarios using vocal and gestural pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, M. 1998. Mimesis and the Executive Suite: missing links in language evolution. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C.

Vocal [[distinctive features]] (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose.

==== "Ritual/speech coevolution" ====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by the distinguished social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]&lt;ref name="Rappaport,_R._A._1999"&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1999. ''Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt; Jerome Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2009" /&gt; Nick Enfield,&lt;ref name="Enfield 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enfield | first1 = N.

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a "theory of the origins of language". This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider&amp;nbsp;— namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2010. [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf The origins of symbolic culture.] In Ulrich J. Frey, Charlotte Störmer and Kai P. Willfuhr (eds) 2010. ''Homo Novus&amp;nbsp;— A Human Without Illusions.'' Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, pp. 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognised within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society&amp;nbsp;— one where communications technology has already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for an ape communicating with other apes in the wild. Not even the cleverest ape could make language work under such conditions.

{{quotation|"Lie and alternative, inherent in language, ... pose problems to any society whose structure is founded on language, which is to say all human societies. I have therefore argued that if there are to be words at all it is necessary to establish ''The Word,'' and that The Word is established by the invariance of liturgy."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1979. ''Ecology, Meaning, and Religion.'' Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Advocates of this school of thought point out that words are cheap. As digital hallucinations, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever ape, or even a group of articulate apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalisations that ''do'' carry conviction&amp;nbsp;— those they actually use&amp;nbsp;— are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Speech consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world&amp;nbsp;— they are a theoretical impossibility.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society&amp;nbsp;— namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called "institutional facts") can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Searle | first1 = John R. | title = The construction of social reality | year = 1995 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-02-928045-4 | oclc = 31411549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any [[hunter-gatherer]] society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ''ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1947 [1915].

Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, pp. 205-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human symbolic culture as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/anthropology-news/wild-voices Chris Knight and Jerome Lewis, 2017.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of the theory include [[Noam Chomsky]], who terms it the "non-existence" hypothesis&amp;nbsp;— a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky (2011): [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 Language and Other Cognitive Systems.

===Twentieth century speculations===

====Festal origins====
The essay "The festal origin of human speech", though published in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan, J. 1891-92. The festal origin of human speech, part I. ''Mind'' '''16'''(64), pp. 495-506.&lt;/ref&gt; made little impact until the American philosopher [[Susanne Langer]] re-discovered and publicised it in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, S. 1957 [1941]. ''Philosophy in a New Key.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"In the early history of articulate sounds they could make no meaning themselves, but they preserved and got intimately associated with the peculiar feelings and perceptions that came most prominently into the minds of the festal players during their excitement."|{{Citation|title=''J. Donovan, 1891.'' The Festal Origin of Human Speech.}}&lt;ref name="Donovan" /&gt;}}
The theory sets out from the observation that primate vocal sounds are above all ''emotionally'' expressive. The emotions aroused are socially contagious. Because of this, an extended bout of screams, hoots or barks will tend to express not just the feelings of this or that individual but the mutually contagious ups and downs of everyone within earshot.

Turning to the ancestors of ''Homo sapiens'', the "festal origin" theory suggests that in the "play-excitement" preceding or following a communal hunt or other group activity, everyone might have combined their voices in a comparable way, emphasising their mood of togetherness with such noises as rhythmic drumming and hand-clapping. Variably pitched voices would have formed conventional patterns, such that choral singing became an integral part of communal celebration.

Although this was not yet speech, according to Langer, it developed the vocal capacities from which speech would later derive. There would be conventional modes of ululating, clapping or dancing appropriate to different festive occasions, each so intimately associated with ''that kind of occasion'' that it would tend to collectively uphold and embody the concept of it. Anyone hearing a snatch of sound from such a song would recall the associated occasion and mood. A melodic, rhythmic sequence of syllables conventionally associated with a certain type of celebration would become, in effect, its vocal mark. On that basis, certain familiar sound sequences would become "symbolic".

In support of all this, Langer cites ethnographic reports of tribal songs consisting entirely of "rhythmic nonsense syllables". She concedes that an English equivalent such as "hey-nonny-nonny", although perhaps suggestive of certain feelings or ideas, is neither noun, verb, adjective, nor any other syntactical part of speech. So long as articulate sound served only in the capacity of "hey nonny-nonny", "hallelujah" or "alack-a-day", it cannot yet have been speech. For that to arise, according to Langer, it was necessary for such sequences to be emitted increasingly ''out of context''&amp;nbsp;— outside the total situation that gave rise to them. Extending a set of associations from one cognitive context to another, completely different one, is the secret of ''metaphor''. Langer invokes an early version of what is nowadays termed "grammaticalisation" theory to show how, from, such a point of departure, syntactically complex speech might progressively have arisen.

Langer acknowledges [[Emile Durkheim]] as having proposed a strikingly similar theory back in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1976 [1912]. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life.''

===="Musilanguage"====
The term "musilanguage" (or "hmmmmm") refers to a pre-linguistic system of vocal communication from which (according to some scholars) ''both'' music ''and'' language later derived. The idea is that rhythmic, melodic, emotionally expressive vocal ritual helped bond coalitions and, over time, set up selection pressures for enhanced volitional control over the speech articulators. Patterns of synchronised choral chanting are imagined to have varied according to the occasion. For example, "we're setting off to find honey" might sound qualitatively different from "we're setting off to hunt" or "we're grieving over our relative's death". If social standing depended on maintaining a regular beat and harmonising one's own voice with that of everyone else, group members would have come under pressure to demonstrate their choral skills.

Archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]] speculates that the Neanderthals possessed some such system, expressing themselves in a "language" known as "Hmmmmm", standing for '''H'''olistic, '''m'''anipulative, '''m'''ulti-'''m'''odal, '''m'''usical and '''m'''imetic.&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;169-175&lt;/sup&gt; In Bruce Richman's earlier version of essentially the same idea,&lt;ref name="Richman 2000" /&gt; frequent repetition of the same few songs by many voices made it easy for people to remember those sequences as whole units. Activities that a group of people were doing while they were vocalising together&amp;nbsp;— activities that were important or striking or richly emotional&amp;nbsp;— came to be associated with particular sound sequences, so that each time a fragment was heard, it evoked highly specific memories. The idea is that the earliest lexical items (words) started out as abbreviated fragments of what were originally communal songs.

{{quotation|"Whenever people sang or chanted a particular sound sequence they would remember the concrete particulars of the situation most strongly associated with it: ah, yes! we sing this during this particular ritual admitting new members to the group; or, we chant this during a long journey in the forest; or, when a clearing is finished for a new camp, this is what we chant; or these are the keenings we sing during ceremonies over dead members of our group."|{{Citation|title=''Richman, B. 2000. How music fixed "nonsense" into significant formulas: on rhythm, repetition, and meaning. In N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown (eds), ''The Origins of Music: An introduction to evolutionary musicology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 301-314.}}}}

As group members accumulated an expanding repertoire of songs for different occasions, interpersonal call-and-response patterns evolved along one trajectory to assume linguistic form. Meanwhile, along a divergent trajectory, polyphonic singing and other kinds of music became increasingly specialised and sophisticated.

To explain the establishment of syntactical speech, Richman cites English "I wanna go home". He imagines this to have been learned in the first instance not as a combinatorial sequence of free-standing words, but as a single stuck-together combination&amp;nbsp;— the melodic sound people make to express "feeling homesick". Someone might sing "I wanna go home", prompting other voices to chime in with "I need to go home", "I'd love to go home", "Let's go home" and so forth. Note that one part of the song remains constant, while another is permitted to vary. If this theory is accepted, syntactically complex speech began evolving as each chanted mantra allowed for variation at a certain point, allowing for the insertion of an element from some other song. For example, while mourning during a funeral rite, someone might want to recall a memory of collecting honey with the deceased, signalling this at an appropriate moment with a fragment of the "we're collecting honey" song.  Imagine that such practices became common. Meaning-laden utterances would now have become subject to a distinctively linguistic creative principle&amp;nbsp;— that of recursive embedding.

====Hunter-gatherer egalitarianism====
[[File:Mbendjele meat sharing.jpg|thumb|Mbendjele hunter-gatherer meat sharing]]
Many scholars associate the evolutionary emergence of speech with profound social, sexual, political and cultural developments. One view is that primate-style dominance needed to give way to a more cooperative and egalitarian lifestyle of the kind characteristic of modern hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193"&gt;Whiten, A. 1999.

=====Intersubjectivity=====
According to [[Michael Tomasello]], the key cognitive capacity distinguishing ''Homo sapiens'' from our ape cousins is "[[intersubjectivity]]". This entails [[turn-taking]] and role-reversal: your partner strives to read your mind, you simultaneously strive to read theirs, and each of you makes a conscious effort to assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.

Tomasello argues that this kind of bi-directional cognition is central to the very possibility of linguistic communication. Drawing on his research with both children and chimpanzees, he reports that human infants, from one year old onwards, begin viewing their own mind as if from the standpoint of others. He describes this as a cognitive revolution. Chimpanzees, as they grow up, never undergo such a revolution. The explanation, according to Tomasello, is that their evolved psychology is adapted to a deeply competitive way of life. Wild-living chimpanzees form despotic social hierarchies, most interactions involving calculations of dominance and submission. An adult chimp will strive to outwit its rivals by guessing at their intentions while blocking them from reciprocating. Since bi-directional intersubjective communication is impossible under such conditions, the cognitive capacities necessary for language don't evolve.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999"&gt;Tomasello, M. 1999.

=====Counter-dominance=====
In the scenario favoured by David Erdal and Andrew Whiten,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erdal | first1 = D. | last2 = Whiten | first2 = A. | year = 1994 | title = On human egalitarianism: an evolutionary product of Machiavellian status escalation? | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 175–183 | doi=10.1086/204255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, D. and A. Whiten 1996. Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution. In P. Mellars and K. Gibson (eds), ''Modelling the Early Human Mind.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute Monographs, pp. 139-150.&lt;/ref&gt; primate-style dominance provoked equal and opposite coalitionary resistance&amp;nbsp;— ''counter-dominance.'' During the course of human evolution, increasingly effective strategies of rebellion against dominant individuals led to a compromise. While abandoning any attempt to dominate others, group members vigorously asserted their personal autonomy, maintaining their alliances to make potentially dominant individuals think twice. Within increasingly stable coalitions, according to this perspective, status began to be earned in novel ways, social rewards accruing to those perceived by their peers as especially cooperative and self-aware.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193" /&gt;

=====Reverse dominance=====
While counter-dominance, according to this evolutionary narrative, culminates in a stalemate, anthropologist Christopher Boehm&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 1997. Egalitarian behaviour and the evolution of political intelligence. In A. Whiten and R. W. Byrne (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and evaluations.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 341-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extends the logic a step further. Counter-dominance tips over at last into full-scale "reverse dominance". The rebellious coalition decisively overthrows the figure of the primate alpha-male. No dominance is allowed except that of the self-organised community as a whole.

As a result of this social and political change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As children grow up, they are motivated by those around them to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds on the model of their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition. It is in this social and political context that language evolves.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

====Scenarios involving mother-infant interactions====

====="Putting the baby down"=====
According to Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory, vocal interactions between early hominin mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falk | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early Hominins: Whence motherese? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 491–503 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their monkey and ape counterparts, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed reassurance that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.

;Criticism
While this theory may explain a certain kind of infant-directed "protolanguage"&amp;nbsp;— known today as "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— it does little to solve the really difficult problem, which is the emergence among adults of syntactical speech. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=====Co-operative breeding=====
Evolutionary anthropologist Sarah Hrdy&lt;ref name="Hrdy 2009"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hrdy | first1 = Sarah Blaffer | title = Mothers and others : the evolutionary origins of mutual understanding | year = 2009 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-03299-6 | oclc = 261174072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that only human mothers among great apes are willing to let another individual take hold of their own babies; further, we are routinely willing to let others babysit. She identifies lack of trust as the major factor preventing chimp, bonobo or gorilla mothers from doing the same: "If ape mothers insist on carrying their babies everywhere&amp;nbsp;... it is because the available alternatives are not safe enough." The fundamental problem is that ape mothers (unlike monkey mothers who may often babysit) do not have female relatives nearby. The strong implication is that, in the course of ''Homo'' evolution, allocare could develop because ''Homo'' mothers did have female kin close by&amp;nbsp;— in the first place, most reliably, their own mothers. Extending the [[Grandmother hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Hawkes 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = K. | last2 = O'Connell | first2 = JF. | last3 = Jones | first3 = NG. | last4 = Alvarez | first4 = H. | last5 = Charnov | first5 = EL. | title = Grandmothering, menopause, and the evolution of human life histories. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336–9 |date=Feb 1998 | pmc = 18762 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/95/3/1336.full | PMID = 9448332 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.1336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hrdy argues that evolving ''[[Homo erectus]]'' females necessarily relied on female kin initially; this novel situation in ape evolution of mother, infant and mother's mother as allocarer provided the evolutionary ground for the emergence of intersubjectivity. She relates this onset of "cooperative breeding in an ape" to shifts in life history and slower child development, linked to the change in brain and body size from the 2 million year mark.

Primatologist Klaus Zuberbühler&lt;ref&gt;Zuberbühler, K. 2012. Cooperative breeding and the evolution of vocal flexibility. In Tallerman, M. and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Human Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 71-81.&lt;/ref&gt; uses these ideas to help explain the emergence of vocal flexibility in the human species. Co-operative breeding would have compelled infants to struggle actively to gain the attention of caregivers, not all of whom would have been directly related. A basic primate repertoire of vocal signals may have been insufficient for this social challenge. Natural selection, according to this view, would have favoured babies with advanced vocal skills, beginning with babbling (which triggers positive responses in care-givers) and paving the way for the elaborate and unique speech abilities of modern humans.

=====Was "mama" the first word?=====
These ideas might be linked to those of the renowned structural linguist Roman Jakobson, who claimed that "the sucking activities of the child are accompanied by a slight nasal murmur, the only phonation to be produced when the lips are pressed to the mother's breast&amp;nbsp;... and the mouth is full".&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1960. "Why 'Mama' and 'Papa'". In B. Caplan and S. Wagner (eds), ''Essays in Honor of Heinz Werner.'' New York: International Universities Press, pp. 124-134; p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that later in the infant's development, "this phonatory reaction to nursing is reproduced as an anticipatory signal at the mere sight of food and finally as a manifestation of a desire to eat, or more generally, as an expression of discontent and impatient longing for missing food or absent nurser, and any ungranted wish." So, the action of opening and shutting the mouth, combined with the production of a nasal sound when the lips are closed, yielded the sound sequence "Mama", which may therefore count as the very first word. Peter MacNeilage sympathetically discusses this theory in his major book, The ''Origin of Speech'', linking it with Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory (see above).&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 144-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, other scholars have suggested completely different candidates for ''Homo sapiens''' very first word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kenneally | first1 = Christine. | title = The first word : the search for the origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Viking | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-670-03490-1 | oclc = 80460757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niche construction theory====
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego. Beavers adapt to an environmental niche which they shape by their own activities.]]While the biological language faculty is genetically inherited, actual languages or dialects are culturally transmitted, as are social norms, technological traditions and so forth. Biologists expect a robust co-evolutionary trajectory linking human genetic evolution with the evolution of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P. J. and R. Boyd, 2004. ''Not by Genes Alone: How culture transformed human evolution.'' Chicago: Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals capable of rudimentary forms of protolanguage would have enjoyed enhanced access to cultural understandings, while these, conveyed in ways that young brains could readily learn, would in turn have become transmitted with increasing efficiency.

In some ways like beavers as they construct their dams, humans have always engaged in [[niche construction]], creating novel environments to which they subsequently become adapted. Selection pressures associated with prior niches tend to become relaxed as humans depend increasingly on novel environments created continuously by their own productive activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laland | first1 = K.

==Conceptual frameworks==

===Structuralism===
{{quotation|"Consider a knight in chess. Is the piece by itself an element of the game? Certainly not. For as a material object, separated from its square on the board and the other conditions of play, it is of no significance for the player. It becomes a real, concrete element only when it takes on or becomes identified with its value in the game. Suppose that during a game this piece gets destroyed or lost. Can it be replaced? Of course it can. Not only by some other knight, but even by an object of quite a different shape, which can be counted as a knight, provided it is assigned the same value as the missing piece."|{{Citation|title=Saussure, F. de 1983 [1916]. ''Course in General Linguistics.'' Translated by R. Harris. London: Duckworth, pp. 108-09.}}}}  The Swiss scholar [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] founded linguistics as a twentieth-century professional discipline. Saussure regarded a language as a rule-governed system, much like a board game such as chess. In order to understand chess, he insisted, we must ignore such external factors as the weather prevailing during a particular session or the material composition of this or that piece. The game is autonomous with respect to its material embodiments. In the same way, when studying language, it's essential to focus on its internal structure as a social institution. External matters (''e.g.'', the shape of the human tongue) are irrelevant from this standpoint. Saussure regarded 'speaking' ''(parole)'' as individual, ancillary and more or less accidental by comparison with "language" ''(langue)'', which he viewed as collective, systematic and essential.

Saussure showed little interest in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Nor did he consider it worthwhile to speculate about how language might originally have evolved. Saussure's assumptions in fact cast doubt on the validity of narrowly conceived origins scenarios. His structuralist paradigm, when accepted in its original form, turns scholarly attention to a wider problem: how our species acquired the capacity to establish [[social institutions]] in general.

===Behaviourism===
{{Main|Behaviourism}}
{{quotation|"The basic processes and relations which give verbal behaviour its special characteristics are now fairly well understood. Much of the experimental work responsible for this advance has been carried out on other species, but the results have proved to be surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behaviour without serious modification."|{{Citation|title=Skinner, B.F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts, p. 3.}}}} In the United States, prior to and immediately following World War II, the dominant psychological paradigm was [[behaviourism]]. Within this conceptual framework, language was seen as a certain kind of behaviour&amp;nbsp;— namely, verbal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; to be studied much like any other kind of behaviour in the animal world. Rather as a laboratory rat learns how to find its way through an artificial maze, so a human child learns the verbal behaviour of the society into which it is born. The phonological, grammatical and other complexities of speech are in this sense "external" phenomena, inscribed into an initially unstructured brain. Language's emergence in ''Homo sapiens,'' from this perspective, presents no special theoretical challenge. Human behaviour, whether verbal or otherwise, illustrates the malleable nature of the mammalian&amp;nbsp;— and especially the human&amp;nbsp;— brain.

===Chomskyan Nativism===
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|left|The [[modularity of mind]] is an idea which was prefigured in some respects by the 19th-century movement of [[phrenology]].]]
{{Main|Jerry Fodor on mental architecture}}{{Main|Cognitive revolution}}Nativism is the theory that humans are born with certain specialised [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitive]] [[modularity|modules]] enabling us to acquire highly complex bodies of knowledge such as the grammar of a language.

{{quotation|"There is a long history of study of origin of language, asking how it arose from calls of apes and so forth. That investigation in my view is a complete waste of time, because language is based on an entirely different principle than any animal communication system." |{{Citation|title=Chomsky, N., 1988. ''Language and Problems of Knowledge.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, p. 183.}}}}

From the mid-1950s onwards, [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 1959 | title = Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 26–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1966. ''Cartesian Linguistics. A chapter in the history of rationalist thought.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Fodor]]&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Fodor, 1983. ''The Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and others mounted what they conceptualised as a 'revolution' against behaviourism. Retrospectively, this became labelled 'the [[cognitive revolution]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. 1985. ''The Mind's New Science. A history of the cognitive revolution.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. and C. E. Erneling (eds.), 1997. ''The Future of the Cognitive Revolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas behaviourism had denied the scientific validity of the concept of "mind", Chomsky replied that, in fact, the concept of "body" is more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2002. ''On Nature and Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviourists tended to view the child's brain as a ''tabula rasa'', initially lacking structure or cognitive content. According to B. F. Skinner, for example, richness of behavioural detail (whether verbal or non-verbal) emanated from the environment. Chomsky turned this idea on its head. The linguistic environment encountered by a young child, according to Chomsky's version of [[psychological nativism]], is in fact hopelessly inadequate. No child could possibly acquire the complexities of grammar from such an impoverished source.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1980. ''Rules and Representations.'' New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Far from viewing language as wholly external, Chomsky re-conceptualised it as wholly internal. To explain how a child so rapidly and effortlessly acquires its natal language, he insisted, we must conclude that it comes into the world with the essentials of grammar already pre-installed.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; No other species, according to Chomsky, is genetically equipped with a language faculty&amp;nbsp;— or indeed with anything remotely like one.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000"&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of such a faculty in ''Homo sapiens'', from this standpoint, presents biological science with a major theoretical challenge.

===Speech act theory===
{{Main|Speech act theory}}One way to explain biological complexity is by reference to its inferred function. According to the influential philosopher [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1978 [1955]. ''How to Do Things with Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; speech's primary function is action in the social world.

[[Speech acts]], according to this body of theory, can be analysed on three different levels: locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary. An act is ''locutionary'' when viewed as the production of certain linguistic sounds&amp;nbsp;— for example, practicing correct pronunciation in a foreign language. An act is ''illocutionary'' insofar as it constitutes an intervention in the world as jointly perceived or understood. Promising, marrying, divorcing, declaring, stating, authorising, announcing and so forth are all speech acts in this ''illocutionary'' sense. An act is ''perlocutionary'' when viewed in terms of its direct psychological effect on an audience. Frightening a baby by saying 'Boo!' would be an example of a "perlocutionary" act.

For Austin, "doing things" with words means, first and foremost, deploying ''illocutionary'' force. The secret of this is community participation or collusion. There must be a 'correct' (conventionally agreed) procedure, and all those concerned must accept that it has been properly followed. {{quotation|"One of our examples was, for instance, the utterance 'I do' (take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife), as uttered in the course of a marriage ceremony. Here we should say that in saying these words we are ''doing'' something&amp;nbsp;— namely, marrying, rather than ''reporting'' something, namely ''that'' we are marrying."|{{Citation|title=Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 12-13.}}}} In the case of a priest declaring a couple to be man and wife, his words will have illocutionary force only if he is properly authorised and only if the ceremony is properly conducted, using words deemed appropriate to the occasion. Austin points out that should anyone attempt to baptize a penguin, the act would be null and void. For reasons which have nothing to do with physics, chemistry or biology, baptism is inappropriate to be applied to penguins, irrespective of the verbal formulation used.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This body of theory may have implications for speculative scenarios concerning the origins of speech. "Doing things with words" presupposes shared understandings and agreements pertaining not just to language but to social conduct more generally. Apes might produce sequences of structured sound, influencing one another in that way. To deploy ''illocutionary'' force, however, they would need to have entered a non-physical and non-biological realm&amp;nbsp;— one of shared contractual and other intangibles. This novel cognitive domain consists of what philosophers term "institutional facts"&amp;nbsp;— objective facts whose existence, paradoxically, depends on communal faith or belief.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969" /&gt; Few primatologists, evolutionary psychologists or anthropologists consider that nonhuman primates are capable of the necessary levels of joint attention, sustained commitment or collaboration in pursuit of future goals.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 2006, Why don't apes point?

===Biosemiotics===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]{{Main|Biosemiotics}}

{{quotation|"the deciphering of the genetic code has revealed our possession of a language much older than hieroglyphics, a language as old as life itself, a language that is the most living language of all&amp;nbsp;— even if its letters are invisible and its words are buried in the cells of our bodies."|{{Citation|title=Beadle, G. and M. Beadle, 1966. ''The Language of Life. An introduction to the science of genetics.'' Doubleday and Co, New York.}}}}

Biosemiotics is a relatively new discipline, inspired in large part by the discovery of the genetic code in the early 1960s. Its basic assumption is that ''Homo sapiens'' is not alone in its reliance on codes and signs. Language and symbolic culture must have biological roots, hence [[Semiotics|semiotic]] principles must apply also in the animal world.

The discovery of the molecular structure of DNA apparently contradicted the idea that life could be explained, ultimately, in terms of the fundamental laws of physics. The letters of the genetic alphabet seemed to have "meaning", yet meaning is not a concept which has any place in physics. The natural science community initially solved this difficulty by invoking the concept of "information", treating information as independent of meaning. But a different solution to the puzzle was to recall that the laws of physics in themselves are never sufficient to explain natural phenomena. To explain, say, the unique physical and chemical characteristics of the planets in our solar system, scientists must work out how the laws of physics became constrained by particular sequences of events following the formation of the Sun.

According to Howard Pattee&amp;nbsp;— a pioneering figure in biosemiotics&amp;nbsp;— the same principle applies to the evolution of life on earth, a process in which certain "frozen accidents" or "natural constraints" have from time to time drastically reduced the number of possible evolutionary outcomes. Codes, when they prove to be stable over evolutionary time, are constraints of this kind. The most fundamental such "frozen accident" was the emergence of DNA as a self-replicating molecule, but the history of life on earth has been characterised by a succession of comparably dramatic events, each of which can be conceptualised as the emergence of a new code.&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri, M. 2003. ''The Organic Codes. An Introduction to Semantic Biology.''

===The Handicap principle===
{{Main|Handicap principle}}

[[Image:Peacock front02 - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|A peacock's tail: a classic example of costly signalling]]

In 1975, the Israeli theoretical biologist [[Amotz Zahavi]]&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1975"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = Mate selection-a selection for a handicap. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–14 |date=Sep 1975 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3| pmid = 1195756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1977"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The cost of honesty (further remarks on the handicap principle). | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–5 |date=Aug 1977 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3| pmid = 904334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Zehavi | first1 = Amots. | last2 = Zahavi | first2 = Avishag. | title = The handicap principle : a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle | year = 1997 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-510035-8 | oclc = 35360821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel theory which, although controversial, has come to dominate Darwinian thinking on how signals evolve. Zahavi's "handicap principle" states that to be effective, signals must be reliable; to be reliable, the bodily investment in them must be so high as to make cheating unprofitable.

Paradoxically, if this logic is accepted, signals in nature evolve not to be efficient but, on the contrary, to be elaborate and wasteful of time and energy. A peacock's tail is the classic illustration. Zahavi's theory is that since peahens are on the look-out for male braggarts and cheats, they insist on a display of quality so costly that only a genuinely fit peacock could afford to pay. Needless to say, not all signals in the animal world are quite as elaborate as a peacock's tail. But if Zahavi is correct, all require some bodily investment&amp;nbsp;— an expenditure of time and energy which "handicaps" the signaller in some way.

Animal vocalisations (according to Zahavi) are reliable because they are faithful reflections of the state of the signaller's body. To switch from an honest to a deceitful call, the animal would have to adopt a different bodily posture. Since every bodily action has its own optimal starting position, changing that position to produce a false message would interfere with the task of carrying out the action really intended. The gains made by cheating would not make up for the losses incurred by assuming an improper posture&amp;nbsp;— and so the phony message turns out to be not worth its price.&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/sup&gt; This may explain, in particular, why ape and monkey vocal signals have evolved to be so strikingly inflexible when compared with the varied speech sounds produced by the human tongue. The apparent inflexibility of chimpanzee vocalisations may strike the human observer as surprising until we realise that being inflexible is necessarily bound up with being perceptibly honest in the sense of "hard-to-fake".

If we accept this theory, the emergence of speech becomes theoretically impossible. Communication of this kind just cannot evolve.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; The problem is that words are cheap. Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance on someone else's tongue&amp;nbsp;— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body&amp;nbsp;— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have found it difficult to explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.

An influential standard textbook is ''Animal Signals,'' by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[David Harper (biologist)|David Harper]].&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signal | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852685-8 | oclc = 54460090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors divide the costs of communication into two components, (1) the investment necessary to ensure transmission of a discernible signal; (2) the investment necessary to guarantee that each signal is reliable and not a fake. The authors point out that although costs in the second category may be relatively low, they are not zero. Even in relatively relaxed, cooperative social contexts&amp;nbsp;— for example, when communication is occurring between genetic kin&amp;nbsp;— some investment must be made to guarantee reliability. In short, the notion of super-efficient communication&amp;nbsp;— eliminating all costs except those necessary for successful transmission&amp;nbsp;— is biologically unrealistic. Yet speech comes precisely into this category.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{Main|Cognitive linguistics}}Cognitive linguistics views linguistic structure as arising continuously out of usage. Speakers are forever discovering new ways to convey meanings by producing sounds, and in some cases these novel strategies become conventionalised. Between phonological structure and semantic structure there is no causal relationship. Instead, each novel pairing of sound and meaning involves an imaginative leap.

In their book, ''Metaphors We Live By,'' [[George Lakoff]] and Mark Johnson helped pioneer this approach, claiming that ''[[metaphor]]'' is what makes human thought special. All language, they argued, is permeated with metaphor, whose use in fact ''constitutes'' distinctively human&amp;nbsp;— that is, distinctively abstract&amp;nbsp;— thought. To conceptualise things which cannot be directly perceived&amp;nbsp;— intangibles such as time, life, reason, mind, society or justice&amp;nbsp;— we have no choice but to set out from more concrete and directly perceptible phenomena such as motion, location, distance, size and so forth. In all cultures across the world, according to Lakoff and Johnson, people resort to such familiar metaphors as ''ideas are locations, thinking is moving'' and ''mind is body''. For example, we might express the idea of "arriving at a crucial point in our argument" by proceeding as if literally travelling from one physical location to the next.

Metaphors, by definition, are not literally true. Strictly speaking, they are fictions&amp;nbsp;— from a pedantic standpoint, even falsehoods. But if we couldn't resort to metaphorical fictions, it's doubtful whether we could even form conceptual representations of such nebulous phenomena as "ideas", thoughts", "minds", and so forth.

The bearing of these ideas on current thinking on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong competitive pressure ''not'' to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might prove to be a fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until our ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt;

===Natural science or social science?===

====Social reality====
{{Main|Social reality}}When people converse with one another, according to the American philosopher [[John Searle]], they're making moves, not in the real world which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of [[illocutionary force]] requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level&amp;nbsp;— that of ''social'' reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of "brute facts"&amp;nbsp;— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief&amp;nbsp;— but of "institutional facts", which "exist" only if you believe in them. Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of "institutional facts". One can distinguish between "brute" facts and "institutional" ones by applying a simple test. Suppose no one believed in the fact&amp;nbsp;— would it still be true? If the answer is "yes", it's "brute". If the answer is "no", it's "institutional".&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;

{{quotation|"Imagine a group of primitive creatures, more or less like ourselves&amp;nbsp;... Now imagine that, acting as a group, they build a barrier, a wall around the place where they live&amp;nbsp;... The wall is designed to keep intruders out and keep members of the group in&amp;nbsp;... Let us suppose that the wall gradually decays. It slowly deteriorates until all that is left is a line of stones. But let us suppose that the inhabitants continue to treat the line of stones as if it could perform the function of the wall. Let us suppose that, as a matter of fact, they treat the line of stones just as if they understood that it was not to be crossed&amp;nbsp;... This shift is the decisive move in the creation of institutional reality. It is nothing less than the decisive move in the creation of what we think of as distinctive in human, as opposed to animal, societies."|{{Citation| title = ''John R. Searle, 1995.'' The construction of social reality, ''Free Press, pp.134''}}&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;}}

The facts of language in general and of speech in particular are, from this perspective, "institutional" rather than "brute". The semantic meaning of a word, for example, is whatever its users imagine it to be. To "do things with words" is to operate in a virtual world which seems real because we share it in common. In this incorporeal world, the laws of physics, chemistry and biology do not apply. That explains why illocutionary force can be deployed without exerting muscular effort. Apes and monkeys inhabit the "brute" world. To make an impact, they must scream, bark, threaten, seduce or in other ways invest bodily effort. If they were invited to play chess, they would be unable to resist throwing their pieces at one another. Speech is not like that. A few movements of the tongue, under appropriate conditions, can be sufficient to open parliament, annul a marriage, confer a knighthood or declare war.&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969"&gt;Searle, J. 1969. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t3_WhfknvF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Speech Acts. An essay in the Philosophy of Language].'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain, on a Darwinian basis, how such apparent magic first began to work, we must ask how, when and why ''Homo sapiens'' succeeded in establishing the wider domain of institutional facts.

====Nature or society?====
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
"[[Brute fact#Searle|Brute facts]]", in the terminology of speech act philosopher [[John Searle]],&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt; are facts which are true anyway, regardless of human belief. Suppose you don't believe in gravity: jump over a cliff and you'll still fall. [[Natural science]] is the study of facts of this kind. "Institutional facts" are fictions accorded factual status within human [[social institutions]]. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations. Take my confidence that these two five-pound banknotes in my pocket are worth ten pounds. That's not merely my subjective belief: it's an objective, indisputable fact. But now imagine a collapse of public confidence in the currency system. Suddenly, the realities in my pocket dissolve.

Scholars who doubt the scientific validity of the notion of "institutional facts" include [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom language is not social. In Chomsky's view, language is a natural object (a component of the individual brain) and its study, therefore, a branch of natural science. In explaining the origin of language, scholars in this intellectual camp invoke non-social developments&amp;nbsp;— in Chomsky's case, a random genetic mutation.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000" /&gt; Chomsky argues that language might exist inside the brain of a single mutant gorilla even if no one else believed in it, even if no one else existed apart from the mutant&amp;nbsp;— and even if the gorilla in question remained unaware of its existence, never actually speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 17-18..&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite philosophical camp are those who, in the tradition of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], argue that if no one believed in words or rules, they simply would not exist. These scholars, correspondingly, regard language as essentially institutional, concluding that linguistics should be considered a topic within [[social science]]. In explaining the evolutionary emergence of language, scholars in this intellectual camp tend to invoke profound changes in social relationships.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dessalles 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dessalles | first1 = Jean-Louis. | title = Why we talk : the evolutionary origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-927623-3 | oclc = 71329834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism.''' Darwinian scientists today see little value in the traditional distinction between "natural" and "social" science. [[Darwinism]] in its modern form is the study of cooperation and competition in nature&amp;nbsp;— a topic which is intrinsically social.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution.'' Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this background, there is an increasing awareness among evolutionary linguists and Darwinian anthropologists that traditional inter-disciplinary barriers can have damaging consequences for investigations into the origins of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurford | first1 = James R. | last2 = Studdert-Kennedy | first2 = Michael. | last3 = Knight | first3 = Chris | title = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dunbar | first1 = Robin I.M.  | last2 = Knight | first2 = Chris | last3 = Power | first3 = Camilla. | title = The evolution of culture : an interdisciplinary vie | year = 1999 | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | location = Edinburgh | isbn = 978-0-7486-1076-1 | oclc = 807340111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Knight | first1 = Chris | last2 = Studdert-Kennedy | first2 = Michael. | last3 = Hurford | first3 = James R. | title = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peng’s Coefficient is an economic term which refers to the proportion of an individual’s spending on culture- and spirit-related products or services, such as books, movie, [[opera]], concert, travelling, training and so forth, to her/his total expenditure. Peng’s Coefficient is inversely proportional to Engel’s [[Coefficient]], because the more proportion people spend on food, the less proportion on culture and spirit.
The concept was named after its creator Peng Bing from China.


Equation: P=S/T
(P refers to Peng’s Coeffient, S refers to culture and spirit-related spending, T refers to total expenditure)

A '''plural society''' is defined by [[Fredrik Barth]] as a [[society]] combining [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] contrasts: the [[Economics|economic]] interdependence of those groups, and their [[Ecology|ecological]] specialization (i.e., use of different environmental resources by each ethnic group). The ecological interdependence, or the lack of competition, between ethnic groups may be based on the different activities in the same region or on long–term occupation of different regions in the
Defined by [[J S Furnivall]] as a medley of [[people]]s - [[Demographics of Europe|European]], [[Nationalities of China|Chinese]], [[Demographics of India|Indian]] and [[wiktionary:native|native]], who do mix but do not combine. Each group holds by its own [[religion]], its own [[culture]] and [[language]], its own [[idea]]s and ways. As individuals they meet, but only in the [[marketplace]] in buying and selling. There is a plural society, with different sections of the [[community]] living side by side, within the same [[Politics|political]] unit.

==Plural Societies and hunting Regimes==

During research about plural societies, Asim Ejaz, Student of M.phil Political Science in Islamia university bahawalpur, Pakistan, presented his analytical summary about the book of Arend Lijphart, "democracy in plural societies" that it is so much difficult to achieve and stable democratic government in plural society. As Aristotle says about stable governing system that, “a state aims at being, as far as it can be, a society composed of equal &amp; peers”. For the stability of democratic regimes, there must be social homogeneity and political consensus among the deep social divisions, and, there must be termination of political differences. There are these criteria, because, the factors that help in producing instability and breakdown of democracies.
Arend Lijphart, therefore, used a particular form of democracy, “Consociational Democracy”, which is, according to him, may be difficult but it is not at all impossible to achieve and maintain stable democratic government in plural societies.

Consociational democracy can be characterized by the cooperative attitude and behavior of the leaders of the different segments of the population. In other meanings, there will be elite cooperation. This model of Consociational democracy is both, normative and an empirical. In Austria, Belgium, Netherland and Switzerland, there are sharp political divisions, but due to Consoiciational democracy, there is existence of political stability. In Austria, political stability can be observed in the forms of Catholic-Socialist elite cooperation and grand coalition.

In non-Western countries, as Arend Lijphart highlights twin problems, and there are, sharp cleavages of various kind and political stability. For the successful democratic regimes in the third world, due to plural societies, Consociational democracy is based, also on normative model. A Plural society is a society, divided by segmental cleavages, and, political stability is characterized by system maintenance, legitimacy, civil order and effectiveness. Without these four elements, which are also interdependent, political stability cannot exist. According to Gabriel Almond, there are four types of political systems;

1)	Anglo-American Political System
2)	Continental European Political System
3)	Pre-Industrial Political System
4)	Totalitarian Political System.

He says that Anglo-American and Continental European Political systems show democratic regimes. The Anglo-American political system is a homogenous and secular political system, while the Continental European political system is characterized by a fragmentation of political culture due to plural societies within European countries.

According to Gabriel Almond, Separation of power doctrine is also concerned with political stability. He extends the idea of “separation of power” from three formal branches of government, executives and legislature, to informal political subcultures like parties, interest groups and the media of communication. He much more emphasizes on input structures than the output structures.

Duverger and Neumann argue that there is a close relationship between the number of parties and democratic stability, but a two party system not only seems to correspond to the nature of things because it can moderate better than multiparty systems. In other words, a two party system is the best aggregation. In Switzerland, there is a multiparty system, while in Austria, there is a two party system.

Arend Lijphart says that there are deep divisions between different segments of the population and absence of a unifying consensus in most of the Asian, African and South American countries like Guyana, Surinam and Trinidad. According to Cliffard Geertz, Communal attachment is called “primordial loyalties”, which may be based on language, religion, custom, region, race or assumed blood ties. Each communal group hold its assumed ties, therefore there is political instability and breakdown of democracy up until now.

He argues that due to political development, western countries have created homogeneity among their plural societies, as like idealize British society. But Gabriel Almond says that, in Continental European political system, there is no secularism and political homogeneity, but there is cultural homogeneity. He argues that, non-western countries would become more comprehensive and less remote they use this continental type, which is based on a multi-racial (multi-national) society and lacking in strong consensus.

Furnivall says that democracy is achieved by the European countries with the help of Consociationalism, and, there is fulfillment of the requirements and demands of the divided societies through appropriate processes. On the other hand, in non-western countries, there is lack of strength in social will and social unity due to divided society, and, it is dangerous for both, the democracy and a considerable degree of political unity.

==Consociational Democracy and the Segments of Plural Society==

As Arend Lijhpart argues that there is constitutionalization for the segments of plural societies, and its better solution is consociational or semi-consociational democratic system. This system provides the facility of Mutual Veto regarding the decision making process on the specific issues within the country, to all the segments of society with equality. but Arend Lijhpart highlights Malaysia and Lebanon for its perfect example. In Lebanon, there are Shia's and Sunni's in the Muslim Segment while Christians are in the minority. Similarly in Malaysia, there are Chinese with local Communities.

'''Pluriculturalism''' is an approach to the self and others as complex rich beings which act and react from the perspective of multiple identifications. In this case, identity or identities are the by-products of experiences in different cultures.  As an effect, multiple identifications create a unique personality instead of or more than a static identity.&lt;ref name=Scribd&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/48131676/pluriculturalism-2 pluriculturalism (2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on multiple-identity, wherein people have multiple identities who belong to multiple groups with different degrees of identification.&lt;ref name=UGR&gt;Trujillo Sáez, Fernando.

'''Project 1975''' started in 2010 as a two-year project based in the [[Netherlands]] with the intent to explore the relationships between [[contemporary art]] and [[postcolonialism]]. With this project [[Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam]] (SMBA) explored the role of art and [[visual culture]] in the context of colonial practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bouwhuis, Jelle. 'Preface'. '' Project 1975. Contemporary Art and the Postcolonial Unconscious'', 2014. Black Dog Publishing Limited, London, {{ISBN|9781908966223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smba"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smba.nl/en/project-1975/ | title=Project '1975' | publisher=SMBA | accessdate=14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project consisted of multiple exhibitions, seminars, reading groups, articles, and a blog.&lt;ref name="smba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="project1975"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://project1975.smba.nl/ | title=SMBA: Project 1975 | publisher=SMBA | accessdate=14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"1975" in the title refers to the year that [[Suriname]] gained independence (the independent Republic of Surinam was founded in 1975) and the [[Netherlands]] thus became to some extent "postcolonial"..

The project broadened SMBA’s focus, traditionally on artists based in [[Amsterdam]], to include artists and people who were new to the city but wanted to contribute to the artistic and cultural environment. Consequently, themes that had not previously been addressed in art institutions in Amsterdam found a place to be discussed at SMBA. Many questions were raised in this project. Artists and critics responded to questions such as "Do colonial mindsets persist in art and in its institutions?".&lt;ref name="smba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="project1975" /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Exhibitions that took place in the context of Project 1975 were: "See Reason", "Identity Bluffs", "[[The Marx Lounge]]", "Mounira Al Solh &amp; Bassam Ramlawi", "Informality, Art, Economy &amp; Precarity", " Vincent Vulsma - A Sign of Autumn ", "The Jinn - [[Tala Madani]]", "Any other Business – Nicoline van Harskamp", "Bart Groenendaal, Stefan Ruitenbeek, Quinsy Gario", "The Memories are Present", "Time, Trade &amp; Travel" and finally "Hollandaise - a Journey into an Iconic Fabric".

The project was finalized with a publication: ''Project 1975. Contemporary Art and the Postcolonial Unconscious '' which includes (visual) documentation of the project, interviews between the curators and artists and essays.&lt;ref name="smba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="project1975" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bouwhuis, Jelle. 'Preface'. '' Project 1975. Contemporary Art and the Postcolonial Unconscious'', 2014. Black Dog Publishing Limited, London, {{ISBN|9781908966223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Memories are Present===
'''The Memories are Present''' and the video programme ''Really Exotic'' ran from 16 June to 12 August 2012 and was curated by Kerstin Winking (SMBA). The participating artists in the exhibition were Artun Alaska Arasli, {{Interlanguage link multi|Pauline M’barek|de}} and Christoph Westermeier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerritrietveldacademie.nl/project/the-memories-are-present?chln=1|title=Gerrit Rietveld Academie|work=gerritrietveldacademie.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus in this exhibition was on the museum as a bearer and communicator of knowledge and interrogated institutional divisions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Winking, Kerstin. ‘The Memories are Present’. SMBA Newsletter No. 128, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Central attention was paid to the ways in which different institutions collect, categorise and display objects. The exhibition challenged the binary oppositions still prevalent in many institutions between “art objects” and “ethnographic objects”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  
The video programme ''Really Exotic'' focused on the notion of the exotic experience. Presented were works that could convey or tell the viewer more about this type of experience.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The videoprogram was organised by Joram
Kraaijeveld and Kerstin Winking (SMBA) in collaboration with Marthe Singelenberg
(Filmtheater Kriterion).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Time, Trade &amp; Travel===
The exhibition '''Time, Trade &amp; Travel''' took place from 25 August to 21 October 2012 and was organized in collaboration with the  [[Nubuke Foundation]], Accra, Ghana. Participating artists were: Bernard Akoi-Jackson, Dorothy Akpene Amenuke, Serge Clottey, Zachary Formwalt, Iris Kensmil, Aukje Koks, Navid Nuur, Jeremiah Quarshie, kąrî’kạchä seidóu, Katarina Zdjelar.&lt;ref name="smba.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smba.nl/en/exhibitions/time-trade-travel/|title=Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam - Time, Trade &amp; Travel - Bernard Akoi-Jackson, Dorothy Akpene Amenuke, Serge Clottey, Zachary Formwalt, Iris Kensmil, Aukje Koks, Navid Nuur, Jeremiah Quarshie, kari-kacha seidâou and Katarina Zdjelar.|work=smba.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the result of an active exchange of knowledge between artists and curators from SMBA and Nubiuke Foundation, Accra. The curators from both institutions as well as the participating artists visited each other in their work and cultural environment.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Bouwhuis, Jelle, Kofi Setordji, Odile Tevie, Kerstin Winking, ‘Time, Trade &amp; Travel’, SMBA Newsletter No. 129, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of this exhibition refers to the complicated aspects of international trade and traffic with their capitalist forces and influence on life and art.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The participating artists in this exhibition set out to discover historical encounters between Africans and Europeans, the subsequent trade and cultual relationships that evolved from these contacts and the extent to which these cultural and economic relationships are still of influence today.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
The exhibition travelled on to the [[Nubuke Foundation]] in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nubukefoundation.org/ Nubuke Foundation]. Last accessed 13 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was curated by: Jelle Bouwhuis and Kerstin Winking (Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam), Kofi Setordji and Odile Tevie ([[Nubuke Foundation]]).&lt;ref name="smba.nl"/&gt; Time, Trade &amp; Travel was made possible in part by contributions from the [[Mondrian Fund]], the [[Amsterdam Fund for the Arts]], [[HIVOS]] and [[SNS REAAL Fund]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Hollandaise - a Journey into an Iconic Fabric===
The exhibition '''Hollandaise: a journey into an iconic fabric''' took place at SMBA from 30 November 2012 to 6 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smba.nl/ SMBA], The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition travelled on to Raw Material Company,&lt;ref name=Raw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawmaterialcompany.org/detail_full.php?categorie_id=11&amp;article_id=80&amp;lang=en|title=Hollandaise|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dakar]] ([[Senegal]]), where it was on view from 10 April – 1 June 2013.

The curator for this exhibition was [[Koyo Kouoh]].&lt;ref name=Kouoh/&gt; Participating artists in this exhibition were [[Godfried Donkor]], [[Abdoulaye Konat]]é, [[Wendelien van Oldenborgh]], [[Willem de Rooij]], Billie Zangewa.&lt;ref name=Raw/&gt;

For this exhibition Kouoh commissioned five artists, all working in the medium of [[textile]], in Europe and Africa to make new works on the subject of “Hollandaise” or “[[African waxprints|Dutch wax]]”,&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;In [[Francophone]] African countries, this material is known as ''Hollandaise'', a reference to its origin in Holland.&lt;/ref&gt; the colourful wax print fabrics that are most often regarded as typically African.&lt;ref name=Raw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kouoh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kouoh|first=Koyo|title=A journey into an iconoc fabric|journal=SMBA Newsletter|volume=130|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of this exhibition a catalogue, edited by Kouoh, and an SMBA Newsletter were published.

'''Scrupulosity''' is characterized by pathological guilt about moral or religious issues. It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scrupulosity: A cognitive–behavioral analysis and implications for treatment|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211364914000116?via=sd|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically conceptualized as a moral or religious form of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD),&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Deacon B, Nelson EA |title=On the nature and treatment of scrupulosity |journal=Pragmatic Case Stud Psychother |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=39–53 |year=2008 |url=http://jrul.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/pcsp/article/view/932/2329 |format=PDF |doi=10.14713/pcsp.v4i2.932}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this categorization is empirically disputable.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

The term is derived from the Latin ''scrupulum'', a sharp stone, implying a stabbing pain on the [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Miller-Hedges"&gt;{{vcite journal |author = Miller CH, Hedges DW|title = Scrupulosity disorder: an overview and introductory analysis|journal = J Anxiety Disord|volume = 22|issue = 6|pages = 1042–58|year = 2008|pmid = 18226490|doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2007.11.004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Scrupulosity was formerly called ''scruples'' in religious contexts, but the word ''[[Scruples (disambiguation)|scruples]]'' now commonly refers to a troubling of the [[conscience]] rather than to the disorder.

As a personality trait, scrupulosity is a recognized diagnostic criterion for [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 301.4 Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/o-cpd.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called "scrupulousness", but that word properly applies to the positive trait of having scruples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scrupulous |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scrupulous |website=Dictionary.com |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:JohnMooreBpOfEly.jpg|thumb|alt=Mezzotint portrait of a seated man in flowing vestments and long wavy hair. He is about 50 years old and with receding hairline and a calm expression on his roundish face. His left hand holds the armrest of his chair, and his right holds a fold of one of his robes on his chest.|[[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]] (shown {{circa|1691–1703}}) was the first to describe the disorder, calling it "religious melancholy".&lt;ref name=Lopez-Ibor/&gt;]]

Scrupulosity is a modern-day psychological problem that echoes a traditional use of the term ''scruples'' in a religious context, e.g. by [[Roman Catholic]]s, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Ciarrocchi JW |date=1995 |title=The Doubting Disease: Help for Scrupulosity and Religious Compulsions |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |isbn=0-8091-3553-1 |ref=Doubting }} Scruples: common and uncommon. p. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Taylor CZ |title=Religious addiction: obsession with spirituality |journal=Pastoral Psych |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=291–315 |doi=10.1023/A:1014074130084 |date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historical and religious figures suffered from doubts of sin, and expressed their pains. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], wrote "After I have trodden upon a cross formed by two straws&amp;nbsp;... there comes to me from without a thought that I have sinned&amp;nbsp;... this is probably a scruple and temptation suggested by the enemy."&lt;ref name=van-Megen&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Obsessive compulsive disorder and religion: a reconnaissance |author=van Megen HJGM, den Boer-Wolters D, Verhagen PJ |pages=271–82 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alphonsus Liguori]], the [[Redemptorists]]' founder, wrote of it as "groundless fear of sinning that arises from 'erroneous ideas'".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Although the condition was lifelong for Loyola and Liguori,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Rose S |date=2007 |title=St. Ignatius Loyola And The Early Jesuits |isbn=1-4086-2255-6 |chapter=Manresa—the spiritual exercises—1523 |pages=45–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Alphonsus de Liguori |editor=Jones FM, editor and translator |date=1999 |title=Selected Writings |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |chapter=Peace for scrupulous souls |pages=209–18 |isbn=0-8091-3771-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] stated that she recovered from her condition after 18 months, writing "One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Monahan J |date=2003 |title=Thérèse of Lisieux |page=45 |isbn=0-8091-6710-7 |publisher=Paulist Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] also suffered from obsessive doubts; in his mind, his omitting the word ''enim'' ("for") during the [[Eucharist]] was as horrible as laziness, divorce, or murdering one's parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Aho JA |date=2005 |title=Confession and Bookkeeping: the Religious, Moral, and Rhetorical Roots of Modern Accounting |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |chapter=Martin Luther and scrupulosity |pages=95–8 |isbn=0-7914-6545-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historical religious figures such as Loyola, Luther and [[John Bunyan]] are commonly cited as examples of scrupulosity in modern self-help books, some of these retrospective diagnoses may be deeply ahistorical: these figures' obsession with salvation may have been excessive by modern standards, but that does not mean that it was pathological.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Cefalu P |title=The doubting disease: religious scrupulosity and obsessive–compulsive disorder in historical context |journal=J Med Humanit  |year=2010 |pmid=20127153 |doi=10.1007/s10912-010-9107-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrupulosity's first known public description as a disorder was in 1691, by [[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]], who called it "religious melancholy" and said it made people "fear, that what they do, is so defective and unfit to be presented unto God, that he will not accept it".&lt;ref name=Lopez-Ibor&gt;{{vcite book |chapterurl=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/18/04706947/0470694718-2.pdf |chapterformat=PDF |chapter=Religious experience and psychopathology |author=López-Ibor JJ Jr, López-Ibor Alcocer MI |pages=211–33 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyola, Liguori, the French confessor [[R.P. Duguet]], and other religious authorities and figures attempted to develop solutions and coping mechanisms;&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; the monthly newsletter ''[[Scrupulous Anonymous]]'', published by the followers of Liguori, has been used as an adjunct to therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Ciarrocchi |title=[[#Doubting|The Doubting Disease]] |chapter=Getting help for scruples and OCD |pages=103–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Christian spiritual advisors in the U.S. and Britain became worried that scrupulosity was not only a sin in itself, but also led to sin, by attacking the virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Studies in the mid-20th century reported that scrupulosity was a major problem among American Catholics, with up to 25&amp;nbsp;per cent of high school students affected; commentators at the time asserted that this was an increase over previous levels.&lt;ref name=Bourke/&gt;

Starting in the 20th century, individuals with scrupulosity in the U.S. and Britain increasingly began looking to psychiatrists, rather than to religious advisors, for help with the condition.&lt;ref name=Bourke&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Bourke J |title=Divine madness: the dilemma of religious scruples in twentieth-century America and Britain |journal=J Soc Hist |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=581–603 |date=2009 |doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This part needs more work.--&gt;

== Characteristics ==

In scrupulosity, a person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear of being an evil person or the fear of divine retribution for sin. Although it can affect nonreligious people, it is usually related to religious beliefs. In the strict sense, not all obsessive–compulsive behaviors related to religion are instances of scrupulosity: strictly speaking, for example, scrupulosity is not present in people who repeat religious requirements merely to be sure that they were done properly.&lt;ref name=Huppert&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Huppert JD, Siev J, Kushner ES |title=When religion and obsessive–compulsive disorder collide: treating scrupulosity in Ultra-Orthodox Jews |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=925–41 |date=2007 |pmid=17828763 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

Treatment is similar to that for other forms of obsessive–compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; [[Exposure and response prevention]] (ERP), a form of behavior therapy, is widely used for OCD in general and may be promising for scrupulosity in particular.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"/&gt; ERP is based on the idea that deliberate repeated exposure to obsessional stimuli lessens anxiety, and that avoiding rituals lowers the urge to behave compulsively. For example, with ERP a person [[Intrusive thought#Blasphemous religious thoughts|obsessed by blasphemous thoughts]] while reading the Bible would practice reading the Bible.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz&gt;{{vcite book |editor=Abramowitz JS, McKay D, Taylor S |title=Clinical Handbook of Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder and Related Problems |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |date=2008 |isbn=0-8018-8697-X |chapter=Scrupulosity |author=Abramowitz JS |pages=156–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC|publisher = Guilford Press|date = 2011-03-14|isbn = 9781609180171|language = en|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Brett J.|last2 = Deacon|first3 = Stephen P. H.|last3 = Whiteside}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ERP is considerably harder to implement than with other disorders, because scrupulosity often involves spiritual issues that are not specific situations and objects. For example, ERP is not appropriate for a man obsessed by feelings that God has rejected and is punishing him. [[Cognitive therapy]] may be appropriate when ERP is not feasible.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Other therapy strategies include noting contradictions between the compulsive behaviors and moral or religious teachings, and informing individuals that for centuries religious figures have suggested strategies similar to ERP.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; Religious counseling may be an additional way to readjust beliefs associated with the disorder, though it may also stimulate greater anxiety.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Little evidence is available on the use of medications to treat scrupulosity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Although [[serotonergic]] medications are often used to treat OCD,&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; studies of pharmacologic treatment of scrupulosity in particular have produced so few results that even tentative recommendations cannot be made.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Treatment of scrupulosity in children has not been investigated to the extent it has been studied in adults, and one of the factors that makes the treatment difficult is the fine line the therapist must walk between engaging and offending the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |editor=McKay D, Storch EA, editors |date=2009 |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Children: Treating Complex and Refractory Cases |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-8261-1686-8 |author=McKay D, Storch EA, Nelson B, Morales M, Moretz MW |chapter=Obsessive–compulsive disorder in children and adolescents: treating difficult cases |pages=81–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

The [[prevalence]] of scrupulosity is speculative. Available data do not permit reliable estimates, and available analyses mostly disregard associations with age or with gender, and have not reliably addressed associations with geography or ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Available data suggest that the [[prevalence]] of obsessive–compulsive disorder does not differ by culture, except where prevalence rates differ for all psychiatric disorders. No association between OCD and depth of religious beliefs has been demonstrated, although data are scarce.&lt;ref name=Huppert/&gt; There are large regional differences in the percentage of OCD patients who have religious obsessions or compulsions, ranging from 0–7% in countries like the U.K. and Singapore, to 40–60% in traditional Muslim and orthodox Jewish populations.&lt;ref name=van-Megen/&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia''''' (''SJE'' - {{lang-ru|Краткая еврейская энциклопедия}}, Kratkaya Yevreyskaya Entsiklopedia) was published in 11 volumes in [[Jerusalem]] from 1976 to 2005 in [[Russian language|Russian]] by the [[Society for Research on Jewish Communities]] with the support of [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem. The ''SJE'' is the only comprehensive encyclopedia on Judaism published in Russian, and followed an almost 70-year gap following the publication of the "[[Yevreyskaya Entsiklopedia]]" (''Encyclopedia Judaica'') of [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary|Brokhaus and Efron]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1908.
&lt;ref name=JE_EJE&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://eleven.co.il/article/15092 Jewish encyclopedias] in ''Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Although it was originally planned as an abridged translation of the English-language ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'', it became clear as the work progressed that readers raised in the [[Soviet Union]] would not be familiar with the concepts lying at the foundation of the cultural and historical system known as [[Jewish civilization]]. Therefore, these concepts were elaborated on in greater detail in the ''SJE'', and terms were introduced which lacked equivalents in modern Russian. Most personal and geographic names (in [[Israel]]) from the [[Bible]] are given in the accepted [[Hebrew]] form. The conceptual foundation of the ''SJE'' is characterized by a thematic bipolarity: [[Eretz Israel]], and in particular the [[State of Israel]] on the one hand, and [[Russian Jews|Russian (i.e., Soviet) Jewry]] on the other, which nevertheless does not exclude the broad scope of different aspects of the lives and history of Jews in all the other countries of the [[diaspora]].&lt;ref name=JE_EJE/&gt;

A group of editors worked on the ''SJE'' who prepared articles with the participation of invited specialists and also academic consultants, including the well-known Israeli academics and public figures [[Shraga Abramson]], [[Mordechai Altschuler]], [[Shlomo Pines]], [[Hayim Tadmor]], [[Chone Shmeruk]], [[Hayyim Schirmann]], [[Menachem Stern]], [[Yaakov Tsur]], [[Yaakov Landau]], [[Israel Bartal]], and [[Michael Liebman]]. Chairing the editorial board were [[Shmuel Ettinger]] and [[Haim Beinhart]]. Chief editors were [[Yitzhak Oren]] (Nadel), [[Michael Zand]], [[Naftali Prat]], and [[Ari Avner]]. The senior academic editors were [[Peretz Hein]], [[Yosef Glozman]], [[Amnon Ginzai]], and [[Mark Kipnis]]. The managing editors were [[Ella Slivkina]] (vol. 1-10) and [[Marina Gutgarts]].&lt;ref name=JE_EJE/&gt;

In practical terms, the ''SJE'' was no longer "shorter," and aside from the 11 volumes a "[[Jewish calendar]] juxtaposed with a [[Gregorian calendar]] (1948-2048)" was published as a pamphlet along with three supplements. Volume 10 also contains a "thematic bibliographic index" with 2,114 items. There are more than 5,300 vocabulary entries, and the total number of words exceeds six million. Volume 11, the final one, included an alphabetized index of subjects, including geographic and personal names and events with references to the volume and column where they are located. A system of citations indicating links between concepts serves as the only cross-reference in the entire corpus of the encyclopedia.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In 1996, the Society for Research on Jewish Communities undertook a reprinting of the first seven volumes of the ''SJE'', which were printed by the printing and publishing house [[Krasnyj Proletarij]] in Moscow.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In 2005, the ''Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia'' (EJE), {{lang-ru|Электронная еврейская энциклопедия}} (Elektronnaja Evrejskaja Entsiklopedia) was made available on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://eleven.co.il/ Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia] based on ''The Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia'' (Краткая еврейская энциклопедия) published in Jerusalem in 1976-2005. The Society for Research on Jewish Communities in cooperation with The Hebrew University, Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; presenting an expanded and more precise version of the ''SJE''. Work on the ''EJE'' continues today.

'''Social Networking Pedagogy''' is a [[philosophy of education]] described by curriculum theorists [[Thomas Patrick Huston]] and [http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Hallie DeCatherine Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} as a form of learner-driven [[participatory culture]] where the user’s experience is reciprocal, consisting of a range of input and output experiences mediated by [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies.  The range of individual and unique differentiated user experiences form a composite impression on the individual which functions as an [[Epistemology|epistemic form]] of how we come to know and experience the world and its social, cultural, political and economic realities.     

In educational settings, social networking pedagogical approaches place [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies at their core, thus presenting expansive opportunities for education to extend the [[curriculum]] beyond the traditional walls of educational institutions by reaching into the daily-lived experiences of individuals. The [[Archive|archival]] features and lack of [[Temporality|temporal]] constraints associated with Internet technologies sustain continually changing currents that educators can connect to [[Student_voice|student-driven]] interests by engaging them with [[Trending_topic#Trends|trending topics]].  Through Social Network Pedagogy, educators can develop a teaching [[Praxis_(process)|praxis]] where the classroom and social space blend and individuals’ creative contributions are acknowledged for their cultural value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29401">{{Sociology}}
{{Literature}}
The '''sociology of literature''' is a subfield of the [[sociology of culture]]. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s 1992  ''Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996).

==Classical sociology==

None of the 'founding fathers' of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[ideology]] has been directed at literature by [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Max Weber]]'s theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by [[Frankfurt School]] writers such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. [[Emile Durkheim]]'s view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by [[Robert Escarpit]]. Bourdieu's work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim

==Lukács and the theory of the novel==

An important first step in the sociology of literature was taken by [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'', first published in German in 1916, in the ''Zeitschrift fur Aesthetik und Allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft''. In 1920 it was republished in book form and this version strongly influenced the Frankfurt School. A second edition, published in 1962, was similarly influential on French structuralism. ''The Theory of the Novel'' argued that, whilst the classical epic poem had given form to a totality of life pregiven in reality by the social integration of classical civilisation, the modern novel had become 'the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1971). ''The Theory of the Novel: A Historico-Philosophical Essay of the Forms of Great Epic Literature'', trans. A. Bostock, London: Merlin Press, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel form is therefore organised around the problematic hero in pursuit of problematic values within a problematic world. 

Lukács's second distinctive contribution to the sociology of literature was ''The Historical Novel'', written in German but first published in Russian in 1937, which appeared in English translation in 1962. Here, Lukács argued that the early 19th century historical novel's central achievement was to represent realistically the differences between pre-capitalist past and capitalist present. This was not a matter of individual talent, but of collective historical experience, because the French Revolution and the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars had made history for the first time a mass experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to argue that the success of the 1848 revolutions led to the decline of the historical novel into 'decorative monumentalization' and the 'making private of history'.&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, G. (1962). ''The Historical Novel'', trans. H. and S. Mitchell, London: Merlin Press, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The key figures in the historical novel were thus those of the early 19th century, especially Sir Walter Scott.

Lukács was an important influence on [[Lucien Goldmann]]'s ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'', Alan Swingewood's discussion of the sociology of the novel in Part 3 of Laurenson and Swingewood's ''The Sociology of Literature'' and [[Franco Moretti]]'s ''Signs Taken for Wonders''.

==The Frankfurt School==

Founded in 1923, the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt developed a distinctive kind of 'critical sociology' indebted to Marx, Weber and Freud. Leading Frankfurt School critics who worked on literature included Adorno, [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Leo Löwenthal]]. Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'', Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' and Löwentahl's ''Literature and the Image of Man'' were each influential studies in the sociology of literature. Löwenthal continued this work at the University of California, Berkeley, during the 1950s.

Adorno's ''Notes to Literature'' is a collection of essays, the most influential of which is probably 'On Lyric Poetry and Society'. It argued that poetic thought is a reaction against the [[commodification]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] of modern life, citing [[Goethe]] and [[Baudelaire]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1991). ''Notes to Literature'', Vol. 1, trans. S.W. Nicholson, New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 37-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin's ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' argued that the extreme 'sovereign violence' of the 16th and 17th century German 'Trauerspiel' (literally mourning play, less literally tragedy) playwrights expressed the historical realities of princely power far better than had classical tragedy.    

Habermas succeeded Adorno to the Chair of Sociology and Philosophy at Frankfurt. Habermas's first major work, ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit'' was published in German in 1962, and in English translation as ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' in 1989. It attempted to explain the socio-historical emergence of middle-class public opinion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Developing a new kind of institutional sociology of literature, it argued that the public sphere had been organised around literary salons in France, learned and literary societies in Germany, and coffee houses in England. These institutions sustained the early novel, newspaper and periodical press.

==The sociology of the avant-garde==

Peter Bürger was Professor of French and Comparative Literature at the University of Bremen. His ''Theorie der Avantgarde'' was published in German in 1974 and in English translation in 1984. Like Habermas, Bürger was interested in the institutional sociology of literature and art. He postulated a historical typology of aesthetic social relations, measured along three main axes, the function of the artwork, its mode of production and its mode of reception.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him three main kinds of art, sacral, courtly and bourgeois. Bourgeois art, he argued, had as its function individual self-understanding and was produced and received individually. It became a celebration in form of the liberation of art from religion, the court and, eventually, even the bourgeoisie. Modernist art was thus an autonomous social 'institution', the preserve of an increasingly autonomous intellectual class. The 'historical avant-garde' of the inter-war years developed as a movement within and against modernism, he concluded, as an ultimately unsuccessful revolt against precisely this autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Bürger, P. (1984). ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'', trans. M. Shaw, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas adopts a very similar approach in his own account of the avant-garde.

==The sociology of the book trade==

Robert Escarpit was Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Bordeaux and founder of the Centre for the Sociology of Literary Facts. His works included ''The Sociology of Literature'', published in French in 1958 and in English translation in 1971, and ''The Book Revolution'', published in French in 1965 and in English in 1966. In Durkheimian fashion, Escarpit aimed to concern himself only with the externally defined 'social facts' of literature, especially those registered in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; His focus fell on the 'community of writers', understood in aggregate as 'generations' and 'teams'. He extended the definition of literature to include all 'non-functional' writing and also insisted that literary success resulted from 'a convergence of intentions between author and reader'.&lt;ref&gt;Escarpit, R. (1971). ''The Sociolology of Literature'', trans. E. Pick, London: Cass, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogously empirical studies of the sociology of the book trade were carried out by [[Lewis Coser]] in the United States and [[Peter H. Mann]] in Britain.

[[Lucien Febvre]] and Henri-Jean Martin's ''L'Apparition du livre'', first published in French 1958 and in English translation as ''The Coming of the Book'' in 1976, is strictly speaking a work of social history (Febvre was a leading figure in the ''Annales'' School of historiography). But it is deeply sociological in character - ''Annales'' history was determinedly social scientific - and provides a systematic account of the long-run development of the European book trade (the period covered is 1450–1800).

==Genetic structuralism==

Lucien Goldmann was Director of Studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris and founding Director of the Centre for the Sociology of Literature at the Free University of Brussels. Like Escarpit, Goldmann was influenced by Durkheim: hence, his definition of the subject matter of sociology as the 'study of the facts of consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann, L. (1970). ''The Human Sciences and Philosophy'', trans. H.V. White and R. Anchor, London: Jonathan Cape, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also interested in developing a sociology of the text. The central task of the literary sociologist, he argued, was to bring out the objective meaning of the literary work by placing it in its historical context, studied as a whole. 

Goldmann defined the creating subject as transindividual, that is, as an instance of Durkheim's 'collective consciousness'. Following Marx and Lukács, however, Goldmann also assumed that group consciousness was normally class consciousnesses. The mediating agency between a social class and the work of literature then became the 'world vision', which binds the individual members of a social class together. ''Le Dieu caché'', his study of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jean Racine]], was published in French in 1955 and in English translation as ''The Hidden God'' in 1964. It identified 'structural homologies' between the Jansenist 'tragic vision', the textual structures of Pascal's ''Pensées'' and Racine's plays, and the social position of the seventeenth-century 'noblesse de robe'. Goldmann's structuralism was 'genetic' because it sought to trace the genesis of literary structures in extra-literary phenomena.

In 1964 Goldmann published ''Pour une Sociologie du Roman'' translated by Alan Sheridan as ''Towards a Sociology of the Novel'' in 1974. Like Lukács, Goldmann sees the novel as revolving around the problematic hero's search for authentic values in a degraded society. But Goldmann also postulates a 'rigorous homology' between the literary form of the novel and the economic form of the commodity. The early novel, he argues, is concerned with individual biography and the problematic hero, but, as competitive capitalism evolves into monopoly capitalism, the problematic hero progressively disappears. The period between the First and Second World Wars witnesses a temporary experiment with the community as collective hero: Goldmann's example is [[André Malraux]]. But the main line of development is characterised by the effort to write the novel of 'the absence of subjects'. Here, Goldmann's example is the ''nouveau roman'' of [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and [[Nathalie Sarraute]].  

[[Andrew Milner]]'s ''John Milton and the English Revolution'' (1981) is essentially an application of Goldmann's genetic structuralism to the study of seventeenth-century English literature.

==Sociocriticism==

Goldmann's sociology of literature remains significant in itself and as a source of inspiration, both positive and negative, to the kind of 'sociocriticism' developed by Edmond Cros, Pierre Zima and their co-workers in France and Canada.

==Neo-Marxian ideology critique==

Marx used the term ideology to denote the inner connectedness of culture, including literature, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. and F. Engels (1970). ''The German Ideology'', Part 1, trans. W. Lough, C. dutt and C.P. Magill, London: Lawrence and Wishart, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Louis Althusser elaborated on this notion in the early 1970s, arguing that ideology functions so as to constitute biological individuals as social 'subjects' by representing their imaginary relation to their real conditions of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). 'Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Towards and Investigation' in ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays'', trans. B. Brewster, London: New Left Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Althusser himself art was not ideology. But his theory was applied to literature by Macherey in France, Eagleton in Britain and Jameson in the United States. The central novelty of Eagleton's ''Criticism and Ideology'' was its argument that literature could be understood as 'producing' ideology, in the sense of performing it.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, T. (1976). ''Criticism and Ideology'', London: New Left Books, pp. 64-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson's ''The Political Unconscious'' argued that literary analysis can be focussed on three distinct levels, 'text', 'ideologeme' and 'ideology of form', each of which has its socio-historical corollary, in the equivalent 'semantic horizon' of political history, society and mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, F. (1981), ''The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act'', London: Methuen, pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The version of ideology Jameson applies to all three levels is essentially Althusserian. The novelty of his position, however, was to argue for a 'double hermeneutic' simultaneously concerned with ideology and [[utopia]].

Macherey, Eagleton and Jameson were literary critics by profession, but their applications of ideology-critique to literature are sociological in character, insofar as they seek to explain literary phenomena in extra-literary terms.

==Bourdieu==

Bourdieu was Professor of Sociology at the Collège de France and Director of the Centre de Sociologie Européenne. His first major contribution to the sociology of literature (and other arts) was ''La Distinction'', published in French in 1979 and in English translation in 1984. It is based on detailed sociological surveys and ethnographic observation of the social distribution of cultural preferences. Bourdieu identified three main zones of taste, 'legitimate', 'middle-brow' and 'popular', which he found to be dominant respectively in the educated sections of the dominant class, the middle classes and the working classes. He described legitimate taste as centred on an 'aesthetic disposition' to assert the primacy of form over function. The 'popular aesthetic', by contrast, is based on continuity between art and life and 'a deep-rooted demand for participation'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, its hostility to representations of objects that in real life are either ugly or immoral. Artistic and social 'distinction' are inextricably interrelated, he concluded, because the 'pure gaze' implies a break with ordinary attitudes towards the world and, as such, is a 'social break'.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1984). ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', trans. R. Nice, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Rules of Art'' is more specifically focussed on literature, especially the significance of [[Gustave Flaubert]] for the making of modern French literature. Bourdieu postulated a model of 'the field of cultural production' as structured externally in relation to the 'field of power' and internally in relation to two 'principles of hierarchization', the heteronomous and the autonomous. The modern literary and artistic field is a site of contestation between the heteronomous principle, subordinating art to economy, and the autonomous, resisting such subordination. In Bourdieu's map of the French literary field in the late nineteenth century, the most autonomous genre, that is, the least economically profitable - poetry - is to the left, whilst the most heteronomous, the most economically profitable - drama - is to the right, with the novel located somewhere in between. Additionally, higher social status audiences govern the upper end of the field and lower status audiences the lower end.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1996). ''The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'', trans. S. Emanuel, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Flaubert's distinctive achievement in ''L'Éducation sentimentale'' was, in Bourdieu's account, to have understood and defined the rules of modern autonomous art.

==The rise of the novel==

One of the earliest English-language contributions to the sociology of literature is ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) by Ian Watt, Professor of English at Stanford University. For Watt, the novel's 'novelty' was its 'formal realism', the idea 'that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; His paradigmatic instances are [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Samuel Richardson]] and [[Henry Fielding]]. Watt argued that the novel's concern with realistically described relations between ordinary individuals, ran parallel to the more general development of philosophical realism, middle-class economic individualism and Puritan individualism. He also argued that the form addressed the interests and capacities of the new middle-class reading public and the new book trade evolving in response to them. As tradesmen themselves, Defoe and Richardson had only to 'consult their own standards' to know that their work would appeal to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, I. (1963). ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural materialism==

Raymond Williams was Professor of Drama at Cambridge University and one of the founders of contemporary cultural studies. He described his own distinctive approach as a 'cultural materialism', by which he meant a theory of culture 'as a (social and material) productive process' and of the arts 'as social uses of material means of production'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1980). ''Problems in Materialism and Culture: Selected Essays'', London: Verso, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a clearly sociological, as distinct from literary-critical, perspective: hence, its most general exposition in the United States as ''The Sociology of Culture'' and in Britain as ''Culture'', a 1981 title in Fontana's New Sociology series. Although Williams's interests ranged widely across the whole field of literary and cultural studies, his major work was concentrated on literature and drama. He was thus a sociologist of culture, specialising in the sociology of literature. 

In ''The Long Revolution'' (1961), Williams developed pioneering accounts of the sociology of the book trade, the sociology of authorship and the sociology of the novel. In ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'' (1970), he argued that the modern novel articulated a distinctively modern 'structure of feeling', the key problem of which was the 'knowable community'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1974). ''The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence'', London: Chatto and Windus, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Country and the City'' (1973) he developed a social history of English country-house poetry, aimed at demystifying the idealisations of rural life contained in the literature: 'It is what the poems are: not country life but social compliment; the familiar hyperboles of the aristocracy and its attendants'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. (1973). ''The Country and the City'', New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Marxism and Literature'' (1977) - simultaneously a critique of both Marxism and 'Literature' - is an extensive formal elaboration of Williams's own theoretical system.   

[[Alan Sinfield]]'s ''Faultlines: Cultural Materialism and the Politics of Dissident Reading'' (1992) and ''Literature, Politics and Culture in Postwar Britain'' (1997) are both clearly indebted to Williams. So, too, is Andrew Milner's ''Literature, Culture and Society'' (2005).

==World-systems theory==

Franco Moretti was, by turn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Salerno, of Comparative Literature at Verona University and of English and Comparative Literature at Stanford University. His first book, ''Signs Taken for Wonders'' (1983) was subtitled ''Essays in the Sociology of Literary Forms'' and was essentially qualitative in method. His later work, however, became progressively more quantitative. 

Applying [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s [[world-systems theory]] to literature, Moretti argued, in ''Atlas of the European Novel'' (1998), that the nineteenth-century literary economy had comprised 'three Europes', with France and Britain at the core, most countries in the periphery and a variable semiperiphery located in between. Measured by the volume of translations in national bibliographies, he found that French novelists were more successful in the Catholic South and British in the Protestant North, but that the whole continent nonetheless read the leading figures from both.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, F. (1998).

(1998). ''Atlas of the European Novel 1800–1900'', London: Verso, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moretti's theses prompted much subsequent controversy, collected together in Christopher Prendergast's edited collection ''Debating World Literature'' (2004). Moretti himself expanded on the argument in his ''Distant Reading'' (2013).

==Recent developments==

Building on earlier work in the production of culture, reception aesthetics and cultural capital, the sociology of literature has recently concentrated on readers' construction of meaning. New developments include studying the relationship between literature and group identities; concerning institutional and reader-response analysis; reintroducing the role of intentions of the author in literature; reconsidering the role of ethics and morality in literature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recovering Morality: Pragmatic Sociology and Literary Studies | journal = New Literary History | first1 = S. M. | last1 = Dromi | first2 = E. | last2 = Illouz | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 351–369| id = | accessdate = 2011-03-09 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/v041/41.2.dromi.html | doi=10.1353/nlh.2010.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developing a clearer understanding of how literature is and is not like other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recent Moves in the Sociology of Literature | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | last = Griswold | first = W. | volume = 19 | pages = 455–467| id = | doi=10.1146/annurev.so.19.080193.002323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociology of literature has also recently taken an interest in the global inequality between First-World and Third-World authors, where the latter tend to be strongly dependent on the editorial decisions of publishers in Paris, London or New York and are often excluded from participation in the global literary market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The World Republic of Letters |last1= Casanova |first1= Pascale |year= 2004 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/toc/nlh.41.2.html New Literary History] devoted a special issue to new approaches to the sociology of literature in Spring 2010.

A '''souvenir ''' (from [[French language|French]], for ''a remembrance or memory''),&lt;ref name="etym"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=souvenir|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''memento''', '''keepsake''', or '''token of remembrance'''&lt;ref name="etym"/&gt; is an object a person acquires for the [[memory|memories]] the owner associates with it. A souvenir can be any object that can be collected or purchased and transported home by the traveler as a memento of a visit. While there is no set minimum or maximum cost that one is required to adhere to when purchasing a souvenir, etiquette would suggest to keep it within a monetary amount that the receiver would not feel uncomfortable with when presented the souvenir. The object itself may have intrinsic value, or be a symbol of experience. Without the owner's input, the symbolic meaning is invisible and cannot be articulated.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byte-time.net/souvenir/ch4.htm|title=Museum of the personal: the souvenir and nostalgia|work=byte-time.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723034110/http://www.byte-time.net/souvenir/ch4.htm|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As objects ==
The [[tourism]] industry designates tourism souvenirs as commemorative merchandise associated with a location, often including geographic information and usually produced in a manner that promotes souvenir collecting.

[[File:SouvenirsChichenItza002.JPG|thumbnail|left|Hand-carved wood souvenirs for sale in [[Chichén Itzá]], [[Yucatán]], Mexico.]]
Throughout the world, the souvenir trade is an important part of the tourism industry serving a dual role, first to help improve the local economy, and second to allow visitors to take with them a memento of their visit, ultimately to encourage an opportunity for a return visit, or to promote the locale to other tourists as a form of [[word-of-mouth marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=The Design and Development of Tourist Souvenirs in Henan |last=Niu |first=Jiurong |conference=International Symposium on Tourism Resources and Management |date=February 2010 |pages=329–332 |url=http://www.seiofbluemountain.com/upload/product/201004/2010lyhy06a4.pdf |access-date=17 April 2016 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most collected souvenirs by tourists are photographs as a medium to document specific events and places for future reference.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

Souvenirs as objects include mass-produced merchandise such as [[clothing]]: [[T-shirt]]s and [[hat]]s; [[collectable]]s: [[postcard]]s, [[refrigerator magnet]]s, miniature figures; household items: [[mug]]s, [[Bowl (vessel)|bowls]], [[Plate (dishware)|plate]]s, [[ashtray]]s, [[egg timer]]s, [[spoon]]s, [[fudge]], [[notebook|notepads]], plus many others.

Souvenirs also include non-mass-produced items like [[folk art]], local artisan [[handicrafts]], objects that represent the traditions and culture of the area, non-commercial, natural objects like sand from a beach, and anything else that a person attaches [[Nostalgia|nostalgic]] value to and collects among his personal belongings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://souvenirfinder.com/what-makes-a-souvenir-worth-finding/|title=About me|work=Souvenir Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more grisly form of souvenir in the [[First World War]] was displayed by a [[Pathan]] soldier to an [[England|English]] [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial]]. After carefully studying the [[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]]'s acquisitions (a fragment of [[shell (projectile)|shell]], a spike and badge from a [[Germany|German]] helmet), he produced a cord with the ears of enemy soldiers he claimed to have killed. He was keeping them to take back to [[India]] for his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Geoffrey: Military Anecdotes (1992), Guinness Publishing, p. 20, {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As memorabilia ==
[[File:Souvenir Album of Houston.jpg|thumb|Souvenir Album of Houston, 1891]]

Similar to souvenirs, '''memorabilia''' ([[Latin]] for ''memorable (things)'', plural of ''memorābile'') are objects treasured for their memories or historical interest; however, unlike souvenirs, memorabilia can be valued for a connection to an event or a particular professional field, company or brand.

Examples include sporting events, historical events, culture, and entertainment. Such items include: [[apparel|clothing]]; game equipment; publicity photographs and [[poster]]s; [[Magic (illusion)|magic memorabilia]]; other entertainment-related [[merchandising|merchandise &amp; memorabilia]]; [[film memorabilia|movie memorabilia]]; airline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/advertising/aviation|title=Aviation and Airline Memorabilia|work=Collectors Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other transportation-related memorabilia; and [[pin]]s, among others.

Often memorabilia items are kept in protective covers or display cases to safeguard and preserve their condition.

The largest collection of Superman memorabilia belongs to Herbert Chavez (Philippines).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=209|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== As gifts ==
In [[Japan]], souvenirs are known as {{nihongo|''omiyage''|お土産}}, and are frequently selected from ''[[meibutsu]]'', or products associated with a particular region. Bringing back ''omiyage'' from trips to co-workers and families is a social obligation, and can be considered a form of apology for the traveller's absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=7150|title=Omiyage Gift Purchasing By Japanese Travelers in the U.S.|work=acrwebsite.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Omiyage'' sales are big business at Japanese [[tourism|tourist]] sites.
Unlike souvenirs, however, ''omiyage'' are frequently special food products, packaged into several small portions to be easily distributed to all the members of a family or a workplace.

Travelers may buy souvenirs as [[gift]]s for those who did not make the trip.

In the [[Philippines]] a similar tradition of bringing souvenirs as a gift to family members, friends, and coworkers is called [[pasalubong]].

{{Taoism}}
The '''Three Treasures''' or '''Three Jewels''' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:三|三]][[Wikt:寶|寶]]|p=''sānbǎo''| w=''san-pao''}}) are basic [[virtues]] in [[Taoism]]. Although the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' originally used ''sanbao'' to mean "[[compassion]]", "[[frugality]]", and "[[humility]]", the term was later used to translate the [[Three Jewels]] ([[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]) in [[Chinese Buddhism]], and to mean the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] ([[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jing]], [[qi]], and [[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]) in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]].

==Tao Te Ching==
''Sanbao'' "three treasures" first occurs in ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' chapter 67, which [[Lin Yutang]] (1948:292) says contains [[Laozi]]'s "most beautiful teachings":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
天下皆謂我道大，似不肖。夫唯大，故似不肖。若肖久矣。其細也夫！我有三寶，持而保之。一曰慈，二曰儉，三曰不敢為天下先。慈故能勇；儉故能廣；不敢為天下先，故能成器長。今舍慈且勇；舍儉且廣；舍後且先；死矣！夫慈以戰則勝，以守則固。天將救之，以慈衛之。&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every one under heaven says that our Way is greatly like folly. But it is just because it is great, that it seems like folly. As for things that do not seem like folly — well, there can be no question about ''their'' smallness!&lt;br&gt;
Here are my three treasures. Guard and keep them! The first is pity; the second, frugality; the third, refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven'. &lt;br&gt;
For only he that pities is truly able to be brave; &lt;br&gt;
Only he that is frugal is able to be profuse. &lt;br&gt;
Only he that refuses to be foremost of all things &lt;br&gt;
Is truly able to become chief of all Ministers. &lt;br&gt;
At present your bravery is not based on pity, nor your profusion on frugality, nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death. But pity cannot fight without conquering or guard without saving. Heaven arms with pity those whom it would not see destroyed. (tr. Waley 1958:225)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Arthur Waley]] describes these Three Treasures as, "The three rules that formed the practical, political side of the author's teaching (1) abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment, (2) absolute simplicity of living, (3) refusal to assert active authority."

===Chinese terminology===
The first of the Three Treasures is ''ci'' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:慈|慈]]| p=''cí''|w=''tz'u''|l=compassion, tenderness, love, mercy, kindness, gentleness, benevolence}}), which is also a [[Classical Chinese]] term for "mother" (with "tender love, nurturing " semantic associations). ''Tao Te Ching'' chapters 18 and 19 parallel ''ci'' ("parental love") with ''xiao'' (孝 "filial love; filial piety"). [[Wing-tsit Chan]] (1963:219) believes "the first is the most important" of the Three Treasures, and compares ''ci'' with [[Confucianist]] ''ren'' (仁 "humaneness; benevolence"), which the ''Tao Te Ching'' (e.g., chapters 5 and 38) mocks.

The second is ''jian'' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:儉|儉]]|p=''jiǎn''|w=''chien''|l=frugality, moderation, economy, restraint, be sparing}}), a practice that the ''Tao Te Ching'' (e.g., chapter 59) praises. Ellen M. Chen (1989:209) believes ''jian'' is "organically connected" with the Taoist metaphor ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' (樸 "uncarved wood; simplicity"), and "stands for the economy of nature that does not waste anything. When applied to the moral life it stands for the simplicity of desire."

The third treasure is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: ''Bugan wei tianxia xian'' 不敢為天下先 "not dare to be first/ahead in the world". 
Chen notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] version of the ''Tao Te Ching'', this traditional "Three Treasures" chapter 67 is chapter 32, following the traditional last chapter (81, 31). Based upon this early silk manuscript, Robert G. Henricks (1989:160) concludes that "Chapters 67, 68, and 69 should be read together as a unit." Besides some graphic variants and [[phonetic loan character]]s, like ''ci'' (兹 "mat, this") for ''ci'' (慈 "compassion, love", clarified with the "heart radical" 心), the most significant difference with the received text is the addition of ''heng'' (恆, "constantly, always") with "I constantly have three …" (我恆有三) instead of "I have three …" (我有三).

===English translations===
The language of the ''Tao Te Ching'' is notoriously difficult to translate, as illustrated by the diverse English renditions of "Three Treasures" below.

==Other meanings==
In addition to these Taoist "Three Treasures", Chinese ''sanbao'' can also refer to the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] or the [[Three Jewels]] in [[Buddhism]]. [[Victor H. Mair]] (1990:110) notes that Chinese Buddhists chose the Taoist term ''sanbao'' to translate [[Sanskrit]] ''[[triratna]]'' or ''ratnatraya'' ("three jewels"), and "It is not at all strange that the Taoists would take over this widespread ancient Indian expression and use it for their own purposes."

[[Erik Zürcher]], who studied influences of Buddhist doctrinal terms in Daoism, noted (1980:115) two later meanings of ''sanbao'': ''Dao'' 道 "the Way", ''jing'' 經 "the Scriptures", and ''shi'' 師 "the Master" seems to be patterned after Buddhist usage; ''Tianbao jun'' 天寶君 "Lord of Celestial Treasure", ''Lingbao jun'' 靈寶君 "Lord of Numinous Treasure", and ''Shenbao jun'' 神寶君 "Lord of Divine Treasure" are the ''Sanyuan'' 三元 "Three Primes" of the [[Lingbao School]].

A '''tripartite language''', also called an '''ergative–accusative language''', is one that treats the agent of a [[transitive verb]], the patient of a transitive verb, and the single argument of an [[intransitive verb]] each in different ways.  This contrasts with [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] and [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] languages. If the language has [[morphological case]], the arguments are marked in this way:

* the ''agent'' of a transitive verb takes the [[ergative case]]
* the ''object'' of a transitive verb takes the [[accusative case]]
* the single argument of an intransitive verb takes the [[intransitive case]]

==Examples==
In this [[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]] intransitive sentence, the intransitive argument has no suffix and the verb carries the third person agreement prefix ''hi-'':
:{|
|- 
| Hi-páayn-a || háama 
|-
| {{sc|3nom}}-arrive-{{sc|asp}} || man.{{sc|intr}} 
|-
|colspan=2|"The man arrived." &lt;ref name=Rude1986&gt;Rude, Noel. 1986. Topicality, transitivity, and the direct object in Nez Perce. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 52:124-153.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}}
|}
In a transitive sentence with two third person arguments, the agent is marked with ''-n(i)m'', the patient with ''-ne'', and the verb with the third person on third person transitive agreement marker ''pée-'':
:{|
|-
| Háama-nm || pée-'wi-ye || wewúkiye-ne
|-
| man-{{sc|erg}} || {{sc|3tr}}-shoot-{{sc|asp}} || elk-{{sc|acc}}
|-
|colspan=3|"The man shot the elk."&lt;ref name=Rude1986/&gt;{{rp|126}}
|}

The [[Ainu language|Ainu language of northern Japan]] also shows tripartite marking in its pronominal prefixes, with the first person ''Ku='' being the ergative form, ''=an'' being the intransitive form and ''=en='' being the accusative form. Ainu also shows the [[passive voice]] formation typical of nominative-accusative languages and the [[antipassive]] of ergative-absolutive languages. Like Nez Percé, the use of both the passive and antipassive is a trait of a tripartite language.

Tripartite languages are rare. Besides Native American Nez Perce, they include the Vakh dialects of the [[Khanty language]], [[Wangkumara language|Wangkumara]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and, in its singular pronouns, [[Kala Lagaw Ya language|Kalaw Lagaw Ya]]. [[Yazghulami language|Yazghulami]] is tripartite, but only in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] (1994). ''Ergativity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[constructed language]]s, especially [[engineered language]]s, use a tripartite case system or tripartite adposition system, notably the fictional [[Na'vi language]] featured in the 2009 movie [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]].

'''Urban acupuncture''' is a [[environmentalism|socio-environmental]] theory that combines contemporary [[urban design]] with [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese]] [[acupuncture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamparsonsdesignthesis.blogspot.com/2010/12/urban-acupuncture-marco-casagrande.html Parsons, Adam. (2010, December). "Urban Acupuncture: Marco Casagrande."] University of Portsmouth.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} using small-scale interventions to transform the larger urban context. Sites are selected through analysis of aggregate social, economic and ecological factors, and are developed through a dialogue between designers and the community. Just as the practice of acupuncture is aimed at relieving stress in the human body, the goal of urban acupuncture is to relieve stress in the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ "Urban Acupuncture,"] ''Urban Applications,'' 2013. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} In Taipei, there was an urban acupuncture workshop that aimed to "produce small-scale but socially catalytic interventions" into the city's fabric.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.dk/books?id=QbY7on6asu8C&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=urban+acupuncture+casagrande&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gd8ozw3OLd&amp;sig=D0C58eXMpJuOZzsLtp6XftKyqnA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mZxxUcu4C8HRtQbIsICoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=urban%20acupuncture%20casagrande&amp;f=false Ruin Academy – Casagrande Lab.] In ''Architectural Theories of the Environment: Posthuman Territory,'' ed.

Structure Fabric and Topography Conference, Nanjing University. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=y|reason=Conference paper.|date=October 2016}} the term has been recently championed and developed further by Finnish architect and [[Social theory|social theorist]] [[Marco Casagrande]], this school of thought eschews massive urban renewal projects in favour of a more localised and community approach that, in an era of constrained budgets and limited resources, could democratically and cheaply offer a respite to urban dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/urban-acupuncture-community-localised-renewal-projects Could cities' problems be solved by urban acupuncture?] – ''Leon Kaye, The Guardian'' 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=This is an op-ed written by a proponent of the subject.|date=October 2016}}
Casagrande views cities as complex energy organisms in which different overlapping layers of energy flows are determining the actions of the citizens as well as the development of the city. By mixing environmentalism and urban design Casagrande is developing methods of punctual manipulation of the urban energy flows in order to create an ecologically sustainable urban development towards the so-called 3rd Generation City (postindustrial city). The theory is developed in the [[Tamkang University]] of [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbandevelopmentbergen.blogspot.com/2010/04/interview-witm-m-casagrande-on-urban.html INTERVIEW WITH M. CASAGRANDE ON URBAN ACUPUNTURE]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – ''Laurits Elkjær, Bergen School of Architecture'' 4/2010{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} and at independent multidisciplinary research center [[Ruin Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/ruin-academy/docs/anarchist_gardener_issue_two_hk_special Anarchist Gardener Issue Two HK special 安那其建築園丁港深建築雙城雙年展特別版] – ''Nikita Wu, Ruin Academy'' 2/2012&lt;/ref&gt; With focus on environmentalism and urban design, Casagrande defines urban acupuncture as a design tool where punctual manipulations contribute to creating sustainable urban development, such as the community gardens and urban farms in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/65227327/ParticipativeDesign_Planning.pdf PARTICIPATIVE DESIGN &amp; PLANNING IN CONTEMPORARY URBAN PROJECTS] – '' Christina Rasmussen, Urban Planning &amp; Management, Aalborg University'' 6/2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This is an undergraduate thesis.|date=December 2016}}

Casagrande describes urban acupuncture as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[a] cross-over architectural manipulation of the collective sensuous intellect of a city. City is viewed as multi-dimensional sensitive energy-organism, a living environment. Urban acupuncture aims into a touch with this nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ "Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal,"] – Kyle Miller, MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sensitivity to understand the energy flows of the collective [[Qi|chi]] beneath the visual city and reacting on the hot-spots of this chi. Architecture is in the position to produce the acupuncture needles for the urban chi.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr14/eng/ruin_academy.html "Ruin Academy,"] – Marco Casagrande, Epifanio 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''A weed will root into the smallest crack in the asphalt and eventually break the city.  Urban acupuncture is the weed and the acupuncture point is the crack. The possibility of the impact is total, connecting human nature as part of nature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Casagrande utilized the tenets of acupuncture: treat the points of blockage and let relief ripple throughout the body. More immediate and sensitive to community needs than traditional institutional forms of large scale urban renewal interventions would not only respond to localized needs, but do so with a knowledge of how citywide systems operated and converged at that single node. Release pressure at strategic points, release pressure for the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Urban Applications'' 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participatory planning==

In theory, urban acupuncture opens the door for uncontrolled creativity and freedom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Citizens are enabled to join the creative [[participatory planning]] process, feel free to use city space for any purpose and develop their environment according to their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadsbyggnad.lth.se/fileadmin/stadsbyggnad/images/_1_Sudes_Book/_1_B5_webversion1.pdf Compost City] – Guoda Bardauskaite'' p. 30-31, Sustainable Urban Design Journal 1 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This "new" post-industrialized city Casagrande, dubbed the Third Generation City, is driven by people who are concerned about the destruction that the modern machine is causing to nature including human nature. They want sustainable co-operation with the rest of the nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbaninteraction.net/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Raune Frankjær, Rethink: Urban Interaction'' 10/2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a larger context, a site of urban acupuncture can be viewed as communicating to the city outside like a natural sign of life in a city programmed to subsume it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/37444/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Kelly Chan, Architizer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban acupuncture bears some similarities to the [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] concept of Tactical Urbanism. The idea focuses on local resources rather than capital-intensive municipal programs and promotes the idea of citizens installing and caring for interventions. These small changes, proponents claim, will boost community morale and catalyze revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newurbannetwork.com/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] – ''David West, New Urban Network'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016}} Boiled down to a simple statement, "urban acupuncture" means focusing on small, subtle, bottom-up interventions that harness and direct community energy in positive ways to heal urban blight and improve the cityscape. It is meant as an alternative to large, top-down, mega-interventions that typically require heavy investments of municipal funds (which many cities at the moment simply don't have) and the navigation of yards of bureaucratic [[red tape]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisoldstreet.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/londons-urban-acupuncture-the-urban-physic-garden/ London’s Urban Acupuncture: The Urban Physic Garden] – '' This Old Street'' 8/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=December 2016}} The micro-scale interventions targeted by "urban acupuncture" appeal to both citizen-activists and cash-strapped communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415165829/http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities |date=15 April 2012 }} – '' David West, Better Cities &amp; Towns'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico]] urban acupuncture converts temporary housing, like sheds in the slums, to simple homes that allow for "add-ons" later, based on need and affordability.

This approach can provide a more realistic and less costly method for city planners and citizens as an effective way to make minor improvements in the communities in order to achieve a greater good in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fluxtrends.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=111&amp;limitstart=5 Urban Acupuncture] – ''  Mariam Mahomed, Urban Spaces

[[Jaime Lerner]], the former mayor of [[Curitiba]], suggests urban acupuncture as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; by focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, we{{Who|date=July 2012}} can initiate positive ripple effects for the greater society.

He described in 2007:&lt;br /&gt;
"I believe that some medicinal "magic" can and should be applied to cities, as many are sick and some nearly terminal. As with the medicine needed in the interaction between doctor and patient, in urban planning it is also necessary to make the city react; to poke an area in such a way that it is able to help heal, improve, and create positive chain reactions. It is indispensable in revitalizing interventions to make the organism work in a different way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwanese architect and academic Ti-Nan Chi is looking with micro urbanism at the vulnerable and insignificant side of contemporary cities around the world identified as micro-zones, points for recovery in which micro-projects have been carefully proposed to involve the public on different levels, aiming to resolve conflicts among property owners, villagers, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16364 Chi Ti-Nan develops a project to preserve Hong Kong coastline Tai Long Sai Wan] – '' World Architecture News'' 4/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A loosely affiliated team of architects [[Wang Shu]], Marco Casagrande, [[Hsieh Ying-chun]] and [[Roan Ching-yueh]] (sometimes called WEAK! Architecture) are describing the unofficial Instant City, or Instant Taipei, as architecture that uses the Official City as a ''growing platform and energy source, where to attach itself like a parasite and from where to leach the electricity and water… [The Instant City's] illegal urban farms or night markets is so widespread and deep rooted in the Taiwanese culture and cityscape that we could almost speak of another city on top of the "official" Taipei, a parallel city – or a para-city.''

==Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award==
The winner of the Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award (DBUAA) Cape Town 2012 is the neighbourhood project "Mothers Unite" demonstrating the power of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mothersunite.org.za/2012/04/deutsche-bank-urban-age-award-19-april-2012/ Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award – 19 April 2012] – '' Mothers Unite'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers Unite was founded in 2007 and provides a safe haven from the gangsterism, drugs and violence that are part and parcel of street and home life in the area. Built with donated shipping containers, the village is made up of a library, kitchen, office, sheltered area, playground and food garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db.com/csr/en/social_investments/deutsche_bank_urban_age_award_2012_winner_announced.html Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award 2012 – winner announced] – '' Deutsche Bank Corporate Social Responsibility'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edgar Pieterse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Durable urban change is often about carefully targeted micro interventions that can change the energies and dynamics of a surrounding neighbourhood. When one engages with the physical manifestations that the tenacity, blood, sweat, and tears of the protagonists of Mothers Unite and Masiphumelele Library (another of the eight finalists) have created, the power of urban acupuncture is apparent. These projects serve as reminders that through vision, commitment over the long haul, and principle-based partnerships, just about any problem can be confronted and addressed.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown2014.co.za/2012/04/mothers-unite-urban-acupuncture-for-an-urban-age/ Mothers Unite: Urban acupuncture for an urban age] – '' Cape Town 2014 Live Design.

==Urban ecological restoration==
In ecological restoration of industrial cities Urban Acupuncture can take form as spontaneous and often illegal urban farms and [[Community gardening|community gardens]] punctuating the more mechanical city and tuning it towards a more sustainable co-existence with the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 Taipei Organic Acupuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, P2P Foundation'' 12/2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
Urban Acupuncture areas can receive, treat and [[recycle]] the waste from the surrounding city acting as eco-valleys within the urban fabric. In River Urbanism the Urban Acupuncture areas can include underground [[stormwater]] reservoirs and act as [[flood]] relief for the surrounding city as a [[sponge]] and they can act as [[Biofilter|biological filters]] purifying water originated from polluted rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecture.org/internal/content/download.asp?wdoc=urbanecopuncture-marcocasagrande.doc Urban Ecopuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, World Architecture'' 10/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Urban acupuncture is a point by point manipulation of the urban energy to create a sustainable town or city, which Marco Casagrande has dubbed '3rd Generation Cities'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainablecities.dk/en/city-projects/cases/amsterdam-urban-acupuncture-creates-new-life-in-the-suburbs Amsterdam: Urban Acupuncture creates new life in the suburbs] – ''Danish Architecture Centre, Sustainable Cities'' 6/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

American artist [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] is credited with developing a system for identifying pockets of disrepair in the built environment—the first step in the framework of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
Artist [[Miru Kim]] explores industrial [[ruin]]s and structures making her look at the city as one living organism. She claims to feel not only the skin of the city, but also to penetrate the inner layers of its intestines and veins, which swarm with minuscule life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/zh-tw/miru_kim_s_underground_art.html Miru Kim] – ''TED Talks'' 2/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to a public [[environmental art]] work, Cicada, Casagrande explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Cicada is urban acupuncture for Taipei city penetrating the hard surfaces of industrial laziness in order to reach the original ground and get in touch with the collective Chi, the local knowledge that binds the people of [[Taipei basin]] with nature. The [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of Cicada is an accidental mediator between the modern man and reality. There is no other reality than nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberley Mok ''Treehugeer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental art as urban acupuncture is an artistic way of injecting a healthy dose of natural elements and human scale into the mechanized urban grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archetcetera.blogspot.com/2012/01/signs-of-life.html Signs of Life] – Phyllis Richardson ''Archetcetera'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Wannarexia is a [[cultural phenomenon]] and has no [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] criteria,&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt; although some wannarexics may be instead diagnosed with [[eating disorder not otherwise specified]] (EDNOS).&lt;ref name=amny&gt;{{cite news|title = Bad fad: Wannarexia|work = [[Associated Press]]|publisher = [[AM New York]]|date = 2007-08-06|pages = 24|author = Bauman, Valerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wannarexia is more commonly, but not always, found in teenage girls who want to be trendy,&lt;ref name=amny /&gt; and is likely caused by a combination of [[culture|cultural]] and [[Mass media|media]] influences.&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt;

Dr. Richard Kreipe states that the distinction between anorexia and wannarexia is that anorexics aren't satisfied by their [[weight loss]], while wannarexics are more likely to derive pleasure from weight loss.&lt;ref name=Newsday&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--wannabe-eating-di0804aug04,0,532415.story?page=2 |title='Wannarexic' girls aspire to be anorexic, eating disordered |accessdate=2007-08-06 | work=Newsday|date=2007-08-04|author=Bauman, Valerie|quote=Most commonly found among teenage girls, wannarexia is a label describing those who claim to have anorexia, or wish they did.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-04-wannarexic_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='Wannarexic' girls yearn for eating disorders | date=2007-08-03 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who actually suffer from the eating disorder anorexia are angry, offended, or frustrated about wannarexia.&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt;

Wannarexics may be inspired or motivated by the pro-anorexia, or [[pro-ana]], community that promotes or supports anorexia as a [[Alternative lifestyle|lifestyle choice]] rather than an [[eating disorder]].&lt;ref name=Lyons2006&gt;{{cite journal

Kelsey Osgood uses the label in her book "How To Disappear Completely: On Modern Anorexia" where she describes wannarexia as “a gateway drug for teenagers”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='I feel guilty but I hate my body': a feminist confesses|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/08/feel-guilty-but-hate-my-body-feminist-confesses|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
