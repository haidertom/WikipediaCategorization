'''Action Bioscience''' is a non-commercial, educational [[web site]] sponsored by the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] (AIBS) . It was created to promote [[Biology|bioscience]] [[scientific literacy|literacy]] and bring attention to seven bioscience issues of critical current importance: 1) [[Biodiversity]], 2) [[Natural environment|Environment]], 3) [[Genomics]], 4) [[Biotechnology]], 5) [[Evolution]], 6) New Frontiers, and 7) Science [[Education]]

The organization seeks to:

* motivate the public to play an active role in bioscience education
* show how developments in bioscience research can affect everyone
* promote an understanding of biogeography and the biodiversity of life
* engage the public to reflect on the relationship between human activity and the natural course of evolution
* promote global ecological awareness
* advance formal and informal bioscience education
* encourage students to pursue studies in the biosciences

To meet these goals, the web site provides articles by scientists, science educators, and science students on issues related to seven bioscience challenges: environment, biodiversity, genomics, biotechnology, evolution, new frontiers in science, and bioscience education. In addition, the web site provides educators with original lessons and resources to enhance bioscience teaching. Up-to-date external links are provided at the bottom of each article to help the reader "learn more" about or "get involved" in the issue. Selected articles are translated into Spanish.

It won an award as one of the best sci-tech web sites by [[Scientific American]].&lt;ref&gt;"2003 Sci/Tech Web Awards: BIOLOGY", Scientific American, http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000A436B-4DC2-1ECA-8E1C809EC588EF21, accessed December 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolescence''' ({{etymology|la|adolescere|to grow up}})&lt;ref name="MacmillanDictionaryforStudents"&gt;''Macmillan Dictionary for Students'' Macmillan, Pan Ltd. (1981), page 14, 456. Retrieved 2010-7-15.&lt;/ref&gt; is a transitional stage of [[Developmental biology|physical]] and [[psychological]] [[Human development (biology)|development]] that generally occurs during the period from [[puberty]] to legal adulthood ([[age of majority]]).&lt;!--NOTE: THIS DEFINITION WAS THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED on the talk page, spanning two separate discussions. It is reliably sourced and is the consensus version. Most sources state that adolescence begins at puberty and terminates at (legal) adulthood; most cultures define the end of adolescence by the beginning of legal adulthood rather than by biological adulthood or full biological adulthood. Further, at age 18, which is the age of majority in most countries, most people are at full physical development. Thus, any changes to this definition should be discussed on the talk page first.--&gt;&lt;ref name=MacmillanDictionaryforStudents/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adolescence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adolescence|publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]''|accessdate=May 9, 2012|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adolescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puberty and adolescence|publisher=[[MedlinePlus]]|accessdate=July 22, 2014|archivedate=April 3, 2013|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403080324/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescence is usually associated with the teenage years,&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adolescence|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''|accessdate=April 7, 2012|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/adolescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lifemodel.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Theoretical Basis for the Life Model-Research And Resources On Human Development|publisher= |url=http://www.lifemodel.org/download/Model%20Building%20Appendix.pdf|accessdate= 2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychology.sunysb"&gt;{{cite web|title=PSY 345 Lecture Notes - Ego Psychologists, Erik Erikson |publisher= |url=http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/ewaters/345/2007_erikson/2006_erikson.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tWHzkelF?url=http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/ewaters/345/2007_erikson/2006_erikson.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-16 |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but its physical, psychological or cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later.

A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, R., &amp; Wilson, S. (2004). Adolescence across place and time: Globalization and the changing pathways to adulthood. In R. Lerner and L. Steinberg Handbook of adolescent psychology. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, John; Roker, Debi. Psychologist11. 12 (Dec 1998): 593. "Adolescence".&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country. Furthermore, even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such privileges and responsibilities include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, marriage, and accountability for upholding the law. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.

In studying adolescent development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arnett J. J. | year = 2007 | title = Emerging Adulthood: What Is It, and What Is It Good For? | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives| volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 68–73 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2007.00016.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; adolescence can be defined biologically, as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as changes in the ability to think abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially, as a period of preparation for adult roles. Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the [[sex organ]]s, height, weight, and [[Muscle|muscle mass]], as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. [[Cognition|Cognitive]] advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in [[neuroscience]] or [[behavioral medicine|bio-behavioral health]] might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Côté, J. E. (1996). Identity: A multidimensional analysis. In G. R. Adams, T. Gullotta &amp; R. Montemeyer (Eds.), ''Issues in Adolescent Development (Vol. 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;130–180)''. New York, NY: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; [[developmental psychology|Developmental psychologists]] might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, R., &amp; Blyth, D. (1987). ''Moving into adolescence.'' New York: Aldine de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists have questioned the universality of adolescence as a developmental phase, arguing that traits often considered typical of adolescents are not in fact inherent to the teenage years.

===Puberty in general===
{{Main|Puberty}}
[[File:Cubes teenager.jpg|thumb|left|Upper body of a teenage boy. The structure has changed to resemble an [[adult]] form.]]
Puberty is a period of several years in which rapid physical growth and psychological changes occur, culminating in sexual maturity. The average age of onset of puberty is at 11 for girls and 12 for boys.&lt;ref name=Kail&gt;{{cite book| last = Kail | first = RV |author2=Cavanaugh JC | title = Human Development: A Lifespan View | isbn = 0495600377 | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010|accessdate= September 11, 2014| page = 296 | edition = 5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-n5E7oyCgoC&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PAmf.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Teenage Growth &amp; Development: 11 to 14 Years|publisher=[[Palo Alto Medical Foundation]]|url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/parents/health/growth-11-14.html|quote=For girls, puberty begins around 10 or 11 years of age and ends around age 16. Boys enter puberty later than girls-usually around 12 years of age-and it lasts until around age 16 or 17.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every person's individual timetable for puberty is influenced primarily by [[heredity]], although environmental factors, such as diet and exercise, also exert some influences.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplowitz01&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1542/peds.108.2.347 |vauthors=Kaplowitz PB, Slora EJ, Wasserman RC, Pedlow SE, Herman-Giddens ME |title=Earlier onset of puberty in girls: relation to increased body mass index and race |journal=Pediatrics |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=347–53 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11483799 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11483799}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors can also contribute to [[precocious puberty|precocious]] and [[delayed puberty]].&lt;ref name="Delayed puberty"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplowitz01/&gt;

Some of the most significant parts of pubertal development involve distinctive physiological changes in individuals' height, weight, body composition, and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[respiratory system|respiratory]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Marshal, W. (1978). Puberty. In F. Falkner &amp; J.Tanner (Eds.), ''Human growth'', Vol. 2. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are largely influenced by hormonal activity. Hormones play an organizational role, priming the body to behave in a certain way once puberty begins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sisk C. L. |author2=Foster D.L. | year = 2004 | title = The neural basis of puberty and adolescence | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 10| pages = 1040–1047 | doi = 10.1038/nn1326 | pmid = 15452575 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an active role, referring to changes in hormones during adolescence that trigger behavioral and physical changes.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, C., Hayashi, K., &amp; Levine, S. (1988). Hormones and behavior at puberty: Activation or concatenation. In M. Gunnar &amp; W.A. Collins (Eds.), ''The Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology'', Vol. 21, pp.&amp;nbsp;17–41. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s (for example, a deeper voice and larger [[adam's apple]] in boys, and development of [[breast]]s and more curved and prominent [[hips]] in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the [[pituitary gland]], which secretes a surge of [[Hormone|hormonal]] agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female [[gonads]] are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary [[chemical]]s. The testes primarily release [[testosterone]], and the ovaries predominantly dispense [[estrogen]]. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop [[gynecomastia]] due to an imbalance of [[sex hormone]]s, tissue responsiveness or [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nydick M, Bustos J, Dale JH, Rawson RW |title=Gynecomastia in adolescent boys |journal=JAMA |volume=178 |issue= 5|pages=449–54 |date=November 1961 |pmid=14480779|doi=10.1001/jama.1961.03040440001001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Facial hair]] in males normally appears in a specific order during puberty: The first facial hair to appear tends to grow at the corners of the upper lip, typically between 14 and 17 years of age.&lt;ref name="pamf.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puberty -- Changes for Males|publisher=pamf.org|accessdate=2009-02-20 |url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/puberty/physicalchanges.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303201905/http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/puberty/physicalchanges.html| archivedate= 3 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.ppwr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting The Facts: Puberty|publisher=ppwr|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226191204/http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html|archivedate=26 February 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then spreads to form a [[moustache]] over the entire upper lip. This is followed by the appearance of hair on the upper part of the cheeks, and the area under the lower lip.&lt;ref name="pamf.org"/&gt; The hair eventually spreads to the sides and lower border of the chin, and the rest of the lower face to form a full beard.&lt;ref name="pamf.org"/&gt; As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals.

The major landmark of puberty for males is [[spermarche]], the first [[ejaculation]], which occurs, on average, at age 13.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen &amp; Keiding"&gt;(Jorgensen &amp; Keiding 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; For females, it is [[menarche]], the onset of menstruation, which occurs, on average, between ages 12 and 13.&lt;ref name="Tanner"&gt;(Tanner, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title=Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Age at menarche in Canada: results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children &amp; Youth|publisher=BMC Public Health |year= 2010 |pmid=21110899 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-736 |pmc=3001737 |volume=10 |journal=BMC Public Health |page=736 |vauthors=Al-Sahab B, Ardern CI, Hamadeh MJ, Tamim H |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://vstudentworld.yolasite.com/resources/final_yr/gynae_obs/Hamilton%20Fairley%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynaecology%20Lecture%20Notes%202%20Ed.pdf |title=Obstetrics and Gynaecology |first=Diana |last=Hamilton-Fairley |edition=Second|publisher=Blackwell Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of menarche is influenced by heredity, but a girl's diet and lifestyle contribute as well.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt; Regardless of genes, a girl must have a certain proportion of body fat to attain menarche.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt; Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics).&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplowitz01/&gt; Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt;

The timing of puberty can have important psychological and social consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends.&lt;ref name=abbassi1998&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Abbassi V |title=Growth and normal puberty |journal=Pediatrics |volume=102 |issue=2 Pt 3 |pages=507–11 |year=1998 |pmid=9685454 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports.

For girls, early maturation can sometimes lead to increased self-consciousness, though a typical aspect in maturing females.&lt;ref name="Pamf.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Teenage Growth &amp; Development: 15 to 17 Years|publisher=[[Palo Alto Medical Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-02-20 |url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/parents/health/growth-15-17.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226174419/http://www.pamf.org/teen/parents/health/growth-15-17.html| archivedate= 26 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their bodies' developing in advance, pubescent girls can become more insecure and dependent.&lt;ref name="Pamf.org"/&gt; Consequently, girls that reach sexual maturation early are more likely than their peers to develop [[eating disorder]]s (such as [[anorexia nervosa]]). Nearly half of all American high school girls' diets are to lose weight.&lt;ref name="Pamf.org"/&gt; In addition, girls may have to deal with sexual advances from older boys before they are emotionally and mentally mature.&lt;ref&gt;(Peterson, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having earlier sexual experiences and more unwanted pregnancies than late maturing girls, early maturing girls are more exposed to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;(Caspi et al.1993: Lanza and Collins, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have had such experiences tend to perform not as well in school as their "inexperienced" peers.&lt;ref&gt;(Stattin &amp; Magnussion, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls have usually reached full physical development around ages 15–17,&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAmf.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAMf.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Teenage Growth &amp; Development: 15 to 17 Years|publisher=[[Palo Alto Medical Foundation]]|url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/parents/health/growth-15-17.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while boys usually complete puberty around ages 16–17.&lt;ref name="PAmf.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAMf.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall17677"&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 176–7&lt;/ref&gt; Any increase in height beyond the post-pubertal age is uncommon.

===Growth spurt===
The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in the individual's [[human height|height]] and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones, [[thyroid hormone]]s, and [[androgens]].&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Males experience their growth spurt about two years later, on average, than females. During their peak height velocity (the time of most rapid growth), adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler—about 4&amp;nbsp;inches (10.3&amp;nbsp;cm) a year for males and 3.5&amp;nbsp;inches (9&amp;nbsp;cm) for females.&lt;ref name="Susman, E. 2004"&gt;Susman, E., &amp; Rogol, A. (2004). Puberty and psychological development. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology'', New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to changes in height, adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight (Marshall, 1978). The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one's adult body weight.&lt;ref name="Susman, E. 2004"/&gt; Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty.&lt;ref name=Garn/&gt;

The accelerated growth in different body parts happens at different times, but for all adolescents it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities—the head, hands and feet—followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders.&lt;ref name="Tanner, J. 1972"&gt;Tanner, J. (1972). Sequence, tempo, and individual variation in growth and development of boys and girls aged twelve to sixteen. In J. Kagan &amp; R. Coles (Eds.), ''Twelve to sixteen: Early adolescence'', New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; This non-uniform growth is one reason why an adolescent body may seem out of proportion.

During puberty, bones become harder and more brittle. At the conclusion of puberty, the ends of the long bones close during the process called [[epiphysis]]. There can be ethnic differences in these skeletal changes. For example, in the United States of America, bone density increases significantly more among black than white adolescents, which might account for decreased likelihood of black women developing [[osteoporosis]] and having fewer bone fractures there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilsanz V. |author2=Roe T. |author3=Mora S. |author4=Costin G. |author5=Goodman W. | year = 1991 | title = Changes in vertebral bone density in Black girls and White girls during childhood and puberty | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 325 | issue = 23| pages = 1597–1600 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199112053252302 | pmid = 1944449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of significant physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution of fat and muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no sex differences in fat and muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smoll F. |author2=Schutz R. | year = 1990 | title = Quantifying gender differences in physical performance: A developmental perspective | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 360–369 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.26.3.360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pubertal development also affects [[circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[respiratory system|respiratory]] systems as an adolescents' heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity. These changes lead to increased strength and tolerance for exercise. Sex differences are apparent as males tend to develop "larger hearts and lungs, higher systolic blood pressure, a lower resting heart rate, a greater capacity for carrying oxygen to the blood, a greater power for neutralizing the chemical products of muscular exercise, higher blood hemoglobin and more red blood cells".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, A., &amp; Taylor, B. (1980). The biological approach to adolescence: Biological change and psychological adaptation. In J. Adelson (Ed.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology'', pp.129. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some genetic sex differences, environmental factors play a large role in biological changes during adolescence. For example, girls tend to reduce their physical activity in preadolescence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goran M. | year = 1998 | title = Developmental changes in energy expenditure and physical activity in children: Evidence for a decline in physical activity in girls before puberty | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 101 | issue = 5| pages = 887–891 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1542/peds.101.5.887 | pmid = 9565420 | last2 = Gower | first2 = BA | last3 = Nagy | first3 = TR | last4 = Johnson | first4 = RK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Savage M. |author2=Scott L. | year = 1998 | title = Physical activity and rural middle school adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 245–253 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021619930697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may receive inadequate nutrition from diets that often lack important nutrients, such as iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johnson R. |author2=Johnson D. |author3=Wang M. |author4=Smiciklas-Wright H. |author5=Guthrie H. | year = 1994 | title = Characterizing nutrient intakes of adolescents by sociodemographic factors | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 149–154 | doi = 10.1016/1054-139X(94)90542-8 | pmid = 8018688 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These environmental influences in turn affect female physical development.

===Reproduction-related changes===
Primary sex characteristics are those directly related to the [[sex organ]]s. In males, the first stages of puberty involve growth of the testes and scrotum, followed by growth of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, B. (1976). ''Introduction to human sexuality''. Belmont, CA: Star.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the penis develops, the [[seminal vesicle]]s, the [[prostate]], and the [[bulbourethral gland]] also enlarge and develop. The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation.&lt;ref name="Tanner, J. 1972"/&gt; Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"/&gt;

In females, changes in the primary sex characteristics involve growth of the uterus, vagina, and other aspects of the reproductive system. [[Menarche]], the beginning of menstruation, is a relatively late development which follows a long series of hormonal changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Dorn L.D., Nottelmann E.D., Sussman E.J., Inoff-Germain G., Chrousos G.P. | year = 1999 | title = Variability in hormone concentrations and self-reported menstrual histories in young adolescents: Menarche as an integral part of a developmental process | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 283–304 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021680726753 | last5 = Cutler }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a girl is not fully fertile until several years after menarche, as regular ovulation follows menarche by about two years.&lt;ref&gt;Hafetz, E. (1976). Parameters of sexual maturity in man. In E. Hafetz (Ed.), ''Perspectives in human reproduction'', Vol. 3: ''Sexual maturity: Physiological and clinical parameters.'' Ann Arbor, MI: Ann Arbor Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike males, therefore, females usually appear physically mature before they are capable of becoming pregnant.

Changes in [[secondary sex characteristic]]s include every change that is not directly related to sexual reproduction. In males, these changes involve appearance of pubic, facial, and body hair, deepening of the voice, roughening of the skin around the upper arms and thighs, and increased development of the sweat glands. In females, secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breasts, widening of the hips, development of pubic and underarm hair, widening of the areolae, and elevation of the nipples.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in secondary sex characteristics that take place during puberty are often referred to in terms of five [[Tanner scale|Tanner stages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthvermont.gov/family/toolkit/tools%5CJ-1%20CARD%20Tanner%20Stages.pdf |title=Tanner stages |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205151003/http://healthvermont.gov/family/toolkit/tools/J-1%20CARD%20Tanner%20Stages.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after the British pediatrician who devised the categorization system.

===Changes in the brain===
The human brain is not fully developed by the time a person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior (see [[#Cognitive development|Cognitive development]] below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age.&lt;ref name="Casey, B. J. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Casey B. J. |author2=Getz S. |author3=Galvan A. | year = 2008 | title = The adolescent brain | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 62–77 | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2007.08.003 | pmid = 18688292 | pmc = 2500212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the brain does not grow in size much during adolescence. However, the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes in the folds of the brain during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.&lt;ref name="Casey, B. J. 2008"/&gt;

Over the course of adolescence, the amount of [[white matter]] in the brain increases linearly, while the amount of [[grey matter]] in the brain follows an inverted-U pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giedd|first1=Jay, N|title=Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Adolescent Brain|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2004|volume=1021|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1196/annals.1308.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a process called [[synaptic pruning]], unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated and the amount of grey matter is pared down. However, this does not mean that the brain loses functionality; rather, it becomes more efficient due to increased [[myelin]]ation (insulation of axons) and the reduction of unused pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Giedd J. N. |author2=Blumenthal J. |author3=Jeffries N. O. |author4=Castellanos F. X. |author5=Liu H. |author6=Zijdenbos A. |author7=Rapoport J. L. | year = 1999 | title = Brain development during childhood and adolescence: a longitudinal MRI study | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 10| pages = 861–863 | doi = 10.1038/13158 | pmid = 10491603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first areas of the brain to be pruned are those involving primary functions, such as motor and sensory areas. The areas of the brain involved in more complex processes lose matter later in development. These include the lateral and [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] cortices, among other regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gogtay N. |author2=Giedd J. N. |author3=Lusk L. |author4=Hayashi K. M. |author5=Greenstein D. |author6=Vaituzis A. C. |author7=Thompson P. M. | year = 2004 | title = Dynamic mapping of human cortical development during childhood through early adulthood | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 21| pages = 8174–8179 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0402680101 | pmid = 15148381 | pmc = 419576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most developmentally significant changes in the brain occur in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in [[decision making]] and cognitive control, as well as other higher cognitive functions. During adolescence, myelination and synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex increases, improving the efficiency of information processing, and neural connections between the prefrontal cortex and other regions of the brain are strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Segalowitz S. J. |author2=Davies P. L. | year = 2004 | title = Charting the maturation of the frontal lobe: An electrophysiological strategy | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 116–133 | doi = 10.1016/S0278-2626(03)00283-5 | pmid = 15134847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to better evaluation of risks and rewards, as well as improved control over impulses. Specifically, developments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are important for controlling impulses and planning ahead, while development in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is important for decision making. Changes in the orbitofrontal cortex are important for evaluating rewards and risks.

Three [[neurotransmitter]]s that play important roles in adolescent brain development are [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]]. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. During the synaptic pruning that occurs during adolescence, most of the neural connections that are pruned contain receptors for glutamate or other excitatory neurotransmitters.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger, D.R., Elvevåg, B., Giedd, J.N. (2005). The Adolescent Brain: A Work in Progress. ''The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy''.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, by early adulthood the synaptic balance in the brain is more inhibitory than excitatory.

[[Dopamine]] is associated with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision-making. During adolescence, dopamine levels in the [[limbic system]] increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spear L. P. | year = 2000 | title = The adolescent brain and age-related behavioral manifestations | url = http://faculty.weber.edu/eamsel/Classes/Child%203000/Adolescent%20Risk%20taking/Lectures/3-4%20Biological/Spear%20LV%20%20(2000).pdf| journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 417–463 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(00)00014-2 | pmid = 10817843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitters and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent risk-taking and vulnerability to boredom (see [[#Cognitive development|Cognitive development]] below).

[[Serotonin]] is a neuromodulator involved in regulation of mood and behavior. Development in the limbic system plays an important role in determining rewards and punishments and processing emotional experience and social information. Changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and [[serotonin]] in the limbic system make adolescents more emotional and more responsive to rewards and stress. The corresponding increase in emotional variability also can increase adolescents' vulnerability. The effect of serotonin is not limited to the limbic system: Several serotonin receptors have their gene expression change dramatically during adolescence, particularly in the human frontal and prefrontal cortex

==Cognitive development==
Adolescence is also a time for rapid cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s916RMYHgJIC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=adolescents+rapid+%22cognitive+development%22#v=onepage&amp;q=adolescents%20rapid%20%22cognitive%20development%22&amp;f=false |title=S.R.

This allows the individual to think and reason in a wider perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etr.org/recapp/theories/AdolescentDevelopment/developmentalTheories.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227022804/http://etr.org/recapp/theories/AdolescentDevelopment/developmentalTheories.htm|archivedate=2009-02-27 |title=ReCAPP: Theories &amp; Approaches: Adolescent Development |publisher=Etr.org |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of behavioural and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] studies have demonstrated development of [[executive functions]], that is, cognitive skills that enable the control and coordination of thoughts and behaviour, which are generally associated with the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Choudhury | first1 = S. | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S.-J. | last3 = Charman | first3 = T. | title = Social cognitive development during adolescence | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 1 | pages = 165–74 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsl024 | issue = 3 | pmid = 18985103 | pmc = 2555426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thoughts, ideas and concepts developed at this period of life greatly influence one's future life, playing a major role in character and personality formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pedersen S |title=Personality formation in adolescence and its impact upon the psycho-analytical treatment of adults |journal=Int J Psychoanal |volume=42 |issue= |pages=381–8 |year=1961 |pmid=14484851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological changes in brain structure and connectivity within the brain interact with increased experience, knowledge, and changing social demands to produce rapid cognitive growth (see [[#Changes in the brain|Changes in the brain]] above). The age at which particular changes take place varies between individuals, but the changes discussed below begin at puberty or shortly after that and some skills continue to develop as the adolescent ages. The [[dual systems model]] proposes a maturational imbalance between development of the socioemotional system and cognitive control systems in the brain that contribute to impulsivity and other behaviors characteristic of adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|date=2010-04-01|title=A dual systems model of adolescent risk-taking|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.20445/abstract|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|language=en|volume=52|issue=3|pages=216–224|doi=10.1002/dev.20445|issn=1098-2302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical perspectives===
There are at least two major approaches to understanding cognitive change during adolescence. One is the [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist view]] of cognitive development. Based on the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], it takes a quantitative, state-theory approach, hypothesizing that adolescents' cognitive improvement is relatively sudden and drastic. The second is the [[information processing|information-processing perspective]], which derives from the study of artificial intelligence and attempts to explain cognitive development in terms of the growth of specific components of the thinking process.

===Improvements in cognitive ability===
By the time individuals have reached age 15 or so, their basic thinking abilities are comparable to those of adults. These improvements occur in five areas during adolescence:
# Attention. Improvements are seen in [[Attention#Selective attention|selective attention]], the process by which one focuses on one stimulus while tuning out another. [[Attention|Divided attention]], the ability to pay attention to two or more stimuli at the same time, also improves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Higgins A. |author2=Turnure J. | year = 1984 | title = Distractibility and concentration of attention in children's development | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = 5| pages = 1799–1810 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1984.tb00422.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schiff A. |author2=Knopf I. | year = 1985 | title = The effects of task demands on attention allocation in children of different ages | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 621–630 | doi = 10.2307/1129752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Memory. Improvements are seen in both [[working memory]] and [[long-term memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Keating, D. (2004). Cognitive and brain development. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of Adolescent Psychology'' (2nd ed.). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Processing speed. Adolescents think more quickly than children. Processing speed improves sharply between age five and middle adolescence; it then begins to level off at age 15 and does not appear to change between late adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kali R.V. |author2=Ferrer E. | year = 2007 | title = Processing speed in childhood and adolescence: Longitudinal models for examining developmental change | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 78 | issue = 6| pages = 1760–1770 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01088.x | pmid = 17988319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Organization. Adolescents are more aware of their thought processes and can use mnemonic devices and other strategies to think more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. (1975). The development of memory: Knowing, knowing about knowing, and knowing how to know. In H. Reese (Ed.), ''Advances in child development and behavior'' (Vol. 10). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Metacognition]].

Studies since 2005 indicate that the brain is not fully formed until the early twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog-extra/the-adolescent-brain-beyond-raging-hormones|title=The adolescent brain: Beyond raging hormones - Harvard Health|first=Harvard Health|last=Publishing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothetical and abstract thinking===
Adolescents' thinking is less bound to concrete events than that of children: they can contemplate possibilities outside the realm of what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in [[deductive reasoning]], which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking. This provides the ability to plan ahead, see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.

The appearance of more systematic, abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence. For example, adolescents find it easier than children to comprehend the sorts of higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies. Their increased facility permits them to appreciate the ways in which language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and [[sarcasm]]. (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm at all.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Demorest A. |author2=Meyer C. |author3=Phelps E. |author4=Gardner H. |author5=Winner E. | year = 1984 | title = Words speak louder than actions: Understanding deliberately false remarks | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1527–1534 | doi=10.2307/1130022 |jstor=1130022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.

===Metacognition===
A third gain in cognitive ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process referred to as [[metacognition]]. It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased [[introspection]], [[self-consciousness]], and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that people do not have complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the [[imaginary audience]] and the [[personal fable]]. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rankin J.L. |author2=Lane D.J. |author3=Gibbons F.X. |author4=Gerrard M. | year = 2004 | title = Adolescent self-consciousness: longitudinal age changes and gender differences in two cohorts | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 1–21 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01401001.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to metacognition and [[abstraction|abstract thought]], perspective-taking involves a more sophisticated [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J., &amp; Villalobos, M. (2009). Social cognitive development in adolescence. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinber (Eds.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology'' (3rd ed., Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;187–228. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents reach a stage of social perspective-taking in which they can understand how the thoughts or actions of one person can influence those of another person, even if they personally are not involved.&lt;ref&gt;Selman, R. (1980) ''The growth of interpersonal understanding: Developmental and clinical analyses''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relativistic thinking===
Compared to children, adolescents are more likely to question others' assertions, and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths. Through experience outside the family circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger children do not make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chandler M | year = 1987 | title = The Othello effect: Essay on the emergence and eclipse of skeptical doubt | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 137–159 | doi=10.1159/000273174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wisdom===
[[Wisdom]], or the capacity for insight and judgment that is developed through experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pasupathi M. |author2=Staudinger U.M. |author3=Bates P.B. | year = 2001| title = Seeds of wisdom: Adolescents' knowledge and judgment about difficult life problems|url =|journal = Developmental Psychology|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 351–361|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.37.3.351|pmid = 11370911}}&lt;/ref&gt; increases between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five, then levels off. Thus, it is during the adolescence-adulthood transition that individuals acquire the type of wisdom that is associated with age. Wisdom is not the same as intelligence: adolescents do not improve substantially on [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] tests since their scores are relative to others in their same age group, and relative standing usually does not change—everyone matures at approximately the same rate in this way.

===Risk-taking===

Because most injuries sustained by adolescents are related to risky behavior ([[Driving under the influence|car crashes]], alcohol, unprotected sex), a great deal of research has been done on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying adolescent risk-taking.  In addressing this question, it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors (prevalence), whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults (cognitive processing perspective), or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions.  The behavioral decision-making theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action. However, research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than do adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Albert D. |author2=Steinberg L. |year = 2011|title = Judgment and Decision Making in Adolescence| url =|journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence| volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 211–224 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00724.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research seems to favor the hypothesis that adolescents and adults think about risk in similar ways, but hold different values and thus come to different conclusions.  Some have argued that there may be evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk-taking in adolescence.  For example, without a willingness to take risks, teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to leave their family of origin.  In addition, from a population perspective, there is an advantage to having a group of individuals willing to take more risks and try new methods, counterbalancing the more conservative elements more typical of the received knowledge held by older adults.  Risktaking may also have reproductive advantages: adolescents have a newfound priority in sexual attraction and dating, and risk-taking is required to impress potential mates. Research also indicates that baseline [[sensation seeking]] may affect risk-taking behavior throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johnson C.A. |author2=Xiao L. |author3=Palmer P. |author4=Sun P. |author5=Want Q. |author6=Wei Y. | year = 2008 | title = Affective decision-making deficits, linked to a dysfunctional ventromedial prefrontal cortex, revealed in 10th grade Chinese adolescent binge drinkers | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 714–726 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.012|display-authors=etal | pmid=17996909 | pmc=3498846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Miller D. |author2=Byrnes J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of contextual and personal factors in children's risk taking | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 5| pages = 814–823 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.33.5.814 | pmid = 9300214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the potential consequences, engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky, particularly for adolescents. Having unprotected sex, using poor birth control methods (e.g. withdrawal), having multiple sexual partners, and poor communication are some aspects of sexual behavior that increase individual and/or social risk. Some qualities of adolescents' lives that are often correlated with [[risky sexual behavior]] include higher rates of experienced abuse, lower rates of parental support and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Luster Tom |author2=Small Stephen A | year = 1994 | title = Factors Associated with Sexual Risk-Taking Behaviors Among Adolescents | doi = 10.2307/352873 | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 622–632 |jstor=352873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inhibition ===
Related to their increased tendency for risk-taking, adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition, including deficits in [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCallum|first=Jessica|last2=Kim|first2=Jee Hyun|last3=Richardson|first3=Rick|date=2010-09-01|title=Impaired Extinction Retention in Adolescent Rats: Effects of D-Cycloserine|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=35|issue=10|pages=2134–2142|doi=10.1038/npp.2010.92|issn=0893-133X|pmc=3055297|pmid=20592716}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications for engaging in risky behavior such as unsafe sex or illicit drug use, as adolescents are less likely to inhibit actions that may have negative outcomes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spear|first=Linda Patia|date=2013-02-01|title=Adolescent Neurodevelopment|journal=The Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=52|issue=2 0 2|pages=S7–13|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.05.006|issn=1054-139X|pmc=3982854|pmid=23332574}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jee Hyun|last2=Richardson|first2=Rick|date=2010-02-15|title=New findings on extinction of conditioned fear early in development: theoretical and clinical implications|journal=Biological Psychiatry|volume=67|issue=4|pages=297–303|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.09.003|issn=1873-2402|pmid=19846065}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jee Hyun|last2=Ganella|first2=Despina E|date=2015-02-01|title=A Review of Preclinical Studies to Understand Fear During Adolescence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ap.12066/abstract|journal=Australian Psychologist|language=en|volume=50|issue=1|pages=25–31|doi=10.1111/ap.12066|issn=1742-9544}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that impaired inhibition, specifically extinction, may help to explain adolescent propensity to relapse to drug-seeking even following behavioral treatment for addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zbukvic|first=Isabel C.|last2=Ganella|first2=Despina E.|last3=Perry|first3=Christina J.|last4=Madsen|first4=Heather B.|last5=Bye|first5=Christopher R.|last6=Lawrence|first6=Andrew J.|last7=Kim|first7=Jee Hyun|date=2016-03-05|title=Role of Dopamine 2 Receptor in Impaired Drug-Cue Extinction in Adolescent Rats|url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/03/05/cercor.bhw051|journal=Cerebral Cortex|language=en|pages=2895–904|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhw051|issn=1047-3211|pmid=26946126|pmc=4869820|volume=26|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological development==
[[File:G. Stanley Hall.jpg|thumb|G. Stanley Hall]]
The formal study of adolescent psychology began with the publication of [[G. Stanley Hall]]'s "Adolescence in 1904". Hall, who was the first president of the [[American Psychological Association]], viewed adolescence primarily as a time of internal turmoil and upheaval (''sturm und drang''). This understanding of [[youth]] was based on two then new ways of understanding [[human behavior]]: [[Darwinism|Darwin's evolutionary theory]] and Freud's [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic theory]].  He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as [[Erik Erikson]] and [[Anna Freud]] started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between [[identity formation]] and role fulfillment.&lt;ref name="Lerner, R.M, &amp; Steinberg, L.D. 2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Adolescent Psychology|year=2004|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|location=Hoboken, NJ|author=Lerner, R.M |author2=Steinberg, L.D. |last-author-amp=yes|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion. The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer relations and cultural influence, were left largely ignored until the 1980s. From the '50s until the '80s, the focus of the field was mainly on describing patterns of behavior as opposed to explaining them.&lt;ref name="Lerner, R.M, &amp; Steinberg, L.D. 2004"/&gt;

[[Jean Macfarlane]] founded the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s Institute of Human Development, formerly called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927.&lt;ref name=NYT19890318&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/18/obituaries/jean-macfarlane-95-psychology-professor.html |title=Jean Macfarlane, 95, Psychology Professor - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-03-18 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--will clean up reference--&gt; The Institute was instrumental in initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities.&lt;ref name=NYT19890318 /&gt; The studies looked at human development during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. [[Jean Macfarlane]] launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oakland Growth and Berkeley Guidance Studies of the Institute of Human Development at the University of California, Berkeley|url=http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/lifecourse/research_projects/oakland_berkeley|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912072515/http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/lifecourse/research_projects/oakland_berkeley|archivedate=2012-09-12|publisher=University of North Carolina|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies provided the background for [[Glen Elder (sociologist)|Glen Elder]] in the 1960s, to propose a [[Life course theory|life-course perspective]] of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of [[human agency]] asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elder|first=Glen|title=The life course as developmental theory|journal=Child Development|date=February 1998|volume=69|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06128.x|pmid=9499552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Society for Research on Adolescence (SRA) became the first official organization dedicated to the study of adolescent psychology. Some of the issues first addressed by this group include: the [[nature versus nurture]] debate as it pertains to adolescence; understanding the interactions between adolescents and their environment; and considering culture, social groups, and historical context when interpreting adolescent behavior.&lt;ref name="Lerner, R.M, &amp; Steinberg, L.D. 2004"/&gt;

Evolutionary biologists like [[Jeremy Griffith]] have drawn parallels between adolescent psychology and the developmental evolution of modern humans from hominid ancestors as a manifestation of [[Recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Jeremy|title=Freedom|year=2011|isbn=978-1-74129-011-0|url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/freedom-book1-sobered-and-depressed-adolescentman/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social development==

===Identity development===

Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle.&lt;ref name="Kroger, J. 1996 pp. 40-46"&gt;Kroger, J. (1996) The Balance Between Self and Other. (pp. 40-46). New York, U.S.A. [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are.&lt;ref name="Strasburger, V.C. 2014 pp. 11-19"&gt;Strasburger, V.C., Wilson B.J., Jordan, A.B. (2014) Children and Adolescents: Unique Audiences. Children, Adolescents, and the Media. (pp. 11-19). U.S.A: [[SAGE Publications]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are likely to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status.&lt;ref name="Kroger, J. 1996 pp. 40-46"/&gt; Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as [[Identity formation|identity development]], rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. New York, NY: [[McGraw-Hill]].&lt;/ref&gt; The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Strasburger, V.C. 2014 pp. 11-19"/&gt; Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991).&lt;ref name="psychtoday"/&gt; The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. Studies done by the [[American Psychological Association]] have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.&lt;ref name="APA on adolescent environment"&gt;[[American Psychological Association]] (APA). [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-concept====
{{See also|Self-concept}}
The idea of self-concept is known as the ability of a person to have opinions and beliefs that are defined confidently, consistent and stable.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020 | volume=48 | issue=2 | title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks | journal=Journal of Adolescent Health | pages=121–127 | pmid=21257109 | date=February 2011 |vauthors=Valkenburg PM, Peter J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in adolescence, [[cognitive development]]s result in greater self-awareness, greater awareness of others and their thoughts and judgments, the ability to think about abstract, future possibilities, and the ability to consider multiple possibilities at once. As a result, adolescents experience a significant shift from the simple, concrete, and global self-descriptions typical of young children; as children they defined themselves by physical traits whereas adolescents define themselves based on their values, thoughts, and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolescents can conceptualize multiple "possible selves" that they could become&lt;ref name="Markus1986"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Markus H. |author2=Nurius P. |year = 1986 | title = Possible selves|url =|journal = American Psychologist|volume = 41|issue = 9| pages = 954–969 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.41.9.954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and long-term possibilities and consequences of their choices.&lt;ref&gt;Nurmi, J. (2004). Socialization and self-development: Channeling, selection, adjustment, and reflection. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring these possibilities may result in abrupt changes in self-presentation as the adolescent chooses or rejects qualities and behaviors, trying to guide the [[self-discrepancy theory#Actual|actual]] self toward the [[self-discrepancy theory#Ideal|ideal]] self (who the adolescent wishes to be) and away from the feared self (who the adolescent does not want to be). For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves.&lt;ref name="Markus1986" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Oyserman D. |author2=Markus H. | year = 1990 | title = Possible selves and deliquency. | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 112–125 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.59.1.112 | pmid = 2213484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further distinctions in self-concept, called "differentiation," occur as the adolescent recognizes the contextual influences on their own behavior and the perceptions of others, and begin to qualify their traits when asked to describe themselves.&lt;ref name="Harter, S. 1999"&gt;Harter, S. (1999). ''The construction of the self''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiation appears fully developed by mid-adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marsh H | year = 1989 | title = Age and sex differences in multiple dimensions of self-concept: Preadolescence to earl adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 417–430 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.81.3.417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peaking in the 7th-9th grades, the [[personality traits]] adolescents use to describe themselves refer to specific contexts, and therefore may contradict one another. The recognition of inconsistent content in the self-concept is a common source of distress in these years (see [[Cognitive dissonance]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harter S. |author2=Monsour A. | year = 1992 | title = Developmental analysis of conflict caused by opposing attributes in the adolescent self-portrait | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 251–260 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this distress may benefit adolescents by encouraging structural development.

====Sense of identity====
[[Egocentrism]] in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R., &amp; Heth, C. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas [[Erik Erikson]] argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of development]] includes the [[identity crisis]] in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of "identity achievement" but also stressed that the identity challenge "is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time".&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 287. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their [[Crowds (adolescence)|crowd membership]]. "Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers." Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers "finding their selves"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;"You're Wearing That?" by Stacey Schultz. U.S. News &amp; World Report Special Issue&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"&gt;{{Citation |last=Rawlins |first=W.K. |title= Friendship matters: Communication, dialectics, and life course |publisher= Aldine de Gruyter |place= New York |year= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. "Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards."&lt;ref&gt;"The Media Assault on Male Body Image" by Brandon Klein. Seed Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marcia J | year = 1966 | title = Development and validation of ego identity status | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 551–558 | doi = 10.1037/h0023281 | pmid = 5939604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marcia J | year = 1976 | title = Identity six years after: A follow-up study | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 551–558 | pmid = 5939604 | doi=10.1037/h0023281}}&lt;/ref&gt; His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and [[interpersonal relationship]]s. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 286. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research since reveals self-examination beginning early in adolescence, but identity achievement rarely occurring before age 18.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia, J. (1980). Identity in adolescence. In J. Adelson (Ed.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology'', pp.&amp;nbsp;159–187. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The freshman year of college influences identity development significantly, but may actually prolong psychosocial moratorium by encouraging reexamination of previous commitments and further exploration of alternate possibilities without encouraging resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Montemayor, R., Brown, B., &amp; Adams, G. (1985). Changes in identity status and psychological adjustment after leaving home and entering college. Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research in Child Development, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, evidence has supported Erikson's stages: each correlates with the personality traits he originally predicted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Studies also confirm the impermanence of the stages; there is no final endpoint in identity development.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 288. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environment and identity====
An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development.&lt;ref name="APA on adolescent environment"/&gt; While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity.&lt;ref name="APA on adolescent environment"/&gt; The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furstenberg|first=Frank F.|title=The Sociology of Adolescence and Youth in the 1990s: A Critical Commentary|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=November 2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=896–910|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00896.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices,&lt;ref&gt;How do Young Adolescents Cope With Social Problems? An Examination of Social Goals, Coping With Friends, and Social Adjustment. ''Journal of Early Adolescence.''&lt;/ref&gt; to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development.  Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions.  While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.&lt;ref name="APA on adolescent environment"/&gt;

====Sexual orientation and identity====
[[Sexual orientation]] has been defined as "an erotic inclination toward people of one or more genders, most often described as sexual or erotic attractions".&lt;ref name="Saewyc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saewyc|first=E.M.|title=Research on Adolescent Sexual Orientation: Development, Health Disparities, Stigma, and Resilience|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=256–272|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00727.x|pmid=27099454|pmc=4835230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, psychologists have sought to understand how sexual orientation develops during adolescence. Some theorists believe that there are many different possible developmental paths one could take, and that the specific path an individual follows may be determined by their sex, orientation, and when they reached the onset of puberty.&lt;ref name="Saewyc"/&gt;

In 1989, Troiden proposed a four-stage model for the development of [[homosexual]] sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Troiden|first=R. R.|title=The formation of homosexual identities|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1989|volume=17|pages=43–73|doi=10.1300/J082v17n01_02|pmid=2668403|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first stage, known as sensitization, usually starts in childhood, and is marked by the child's becoming aware of same-sex attractions. The second stage, identity confusion, tends to occur a few years later. In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners. In the third stage of identity assumption, which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a self-definition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Floyd|first=Frank J.|author2=Stein, Terry S.|title=Sexual orientation identity formation among gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths: Multiple patterns of milestone experiences|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|year=2002|volume=12|issue=2|pages=167–191|doi=10.1111/1532-7795.00030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final stage, known as commitment, the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle. Therefore, this model estimates that the process of coming out begins in childhood, and continues through the early to mid 20s. This model has been contested, and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years.

In terms of [[sexual identity]], adolescence is when most [[gay]]/[[lesbian]] and [[transgender youth|transgender]] adolescents begin to recognize and make sense of their feelings. Many adolescents may choose to [[coming out|come out]] during this period of their life once an identity has been formed; many others may go through a period of [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] or denial, which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences.&lt;ref name="Morrow 2004 91–99"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrow|first=Deana|title=Social work practice with gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender adolescents|journal=Families in Society|date=Jan–Mar 2004|volume=85|issue=1|pages=91–99|doi=10.1606/1044-3894.246}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one's sexual orientation occurred, on average, around age 10, but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Augelli|first=Anthony|author2=Scott Hershberger|title=Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth in community settings: Personal challenges and mental health problems|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|year=1993|volume=21|issue=4|pages=421–448|doi=10.1007/BF00942151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coming to terms with and creating a positive [[LGBT]] identity can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons. Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who are questioning their sexuality or [[gender identity]] are surrounded by [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] peers and can cause great distress due to a feeling of being different from everyone else. While coming out can also foster better psychological adjustment, the risks associated are real. Indeed, coming out in the midst of a heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence.&lt;ref name="Morrow 2004 91–99"/&gt;  Because of this, statistically the [[suicide rate]] amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaylife.about.com/od/gayteens/a/gaysuicide.htm |title=Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning Teen Suicide Statistics - Gay Teen Suicide Statistics |publisher=Gaylife.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-esteem====
The final major aspect of identity formation is [[self-esteem]]. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Marmot, M. (2003) Self-Esteem and Health: Autonomy, Self-Esteem, and Health are Linked Together". British Medical Journal (327) pp. 574-575&lt;/ref&gt; Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 270. New York, NY: [[McGraw-Hill]].&lt;/ref&gt; "Barometric self-esteem" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, M. (1986). Self-concept from middle childhood through adolescence. In J. Suls &amp; A. Greenwald (Eds.), ''Psychological perspectives on the self'', Vol. 3. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 273. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;
Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority.&lt;ref&gt;"Psychology: The Science of Behaviour" 3rd Canadian Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--citation is inadequately specific e.g. author etc--&gt; As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun &amp; Sartorius, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Osvelia Deeds, Jeannette Delgado, Miguel Diego, Tiffany Field, and Martha Pelaez (2009). "Adolescence".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===

====In general====
The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends.&lt;ref name="Adolescent peer pressure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adolescents and Peer Pressure|publisher=sitemaker.umich.edu/[[University of Michigan]]|accessdate=November 6, 2012|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/356.darnell/peer_pressure}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of [[peer pressure]]. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. "The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and,&amp;nbsp;... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barenboim|first=Carl|title=The Development of Person Perception in Childhood and Adolescence: From Behavioral Comparisons to Psychological Constructs to Psychological Comparisons|journal=Child Development|volume=52|pages=129–144|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;hid=14&amp;sid=fdbcae39-8efd-4773-976a-e26f2afc32b7%40sessionmgr13|accessdate=8 November 2012|date=1 March 1981|doi=10.2307/1129222|jstor=1129222}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, R.B., Rosenfeld, L.B., Proctor, R.F., &amp; Winder, C. (2012). "Interplay: The Process of Interpersonal Communication, Third Canadian Edition" Oxford University Press. pp. 42-45&lt;/ref&gt; These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.

====Family====

[[File:James Collinson - The Sisters.jpg|thumb|180px|Teenage sisters]]
Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;Grotevant, H. (1997). Adolescent development in family contexts. In N. Eisenberg (Ed.), ''Handbook of child psychology'' (5th ed.), Vol. 3: ''Social, emotional, and personality development'', pp. 1097–1149. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's [[right to privacy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Steinberg L|year = 2001| title = We know some things: Adolescent-parent relationships in retrospect and prospect | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1111/1532-7795.00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.jrank.org/pages/315/Conflict.html |title=Conflict - Couple Relationships, Family Relationships, Parent-child Relationships - Theory, Development, Children, and Parents - JRank Articles |publisher=Family.jrank.org |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smetana J.

Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements.&lt;ref name="Teens Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theantidrug.com/advice/teens-today/teens-and-technology/social-networking.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103162953/http://www.theantidrug.com/advice/teens-today/teens-and-technology/social-networking.aspx|archivedate=2012-11-03|title=Social Networking|publisher=theantidrug.com|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites in the first place and this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neil R.|author2=Carlson C.|author3=Donald Heth|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour, 4th Canadian Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[childhood]], siblings are a source of conflict and frustration as well as a support system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lempers J, Clark-Lempers D | year = 1992 | title = Young, middle, and late adolescents; comparisons of the functional importance of five significant relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 53–96 | doi = 10.1007/BF01536983 | pmid = 24263682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescence may affect this relationship differently, depending on sibling gender. In same-sex sibling pairs, intimacy increases during early adolescence, then remains stable. Mixed-sex siblings pairs act differently; siblings drift apart during early adolescent years, but experience an increase in intimacy starting at middle adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kim J. |author2=McHale S.

Siblings are able to act as peers, and may increase one another's sociability and feelings of self-worth. Older siblings can give guidance to younger siblings, although the impact of this can be either positive or negative depending on the activity of the older sibling.

A potential important influence on adolescence is change of the family dynamic, specifically [[divorce]]. With the divorce rate up to about 50%,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, updated and revised from "Families and Work in Transition in 12 Countries,1980–2001," Monthly Labor Review, September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. [[Child custody|Custody]] disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent.&lt;ref name="Vangelisti"&gt;{{Citation |last=Vangelisti |first=A.L. |title= Handbook of family communication |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |place=New Jersey |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can have a positive effect on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers who grow up in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sun Y. |author2=Li Y. | year = 2009 | title = Postdivorce family stability and changes in adolescents' academic performance: A growth-curve model | url = | journal = Journal of Family Issues | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 1527–1555 | doi=10.1177/0192513x09339022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory,&lt;ref name="Ziemer"/&gt; which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training.&lt;ref name="Ziemer"&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Ziemer, B.

These negative effects include romantic relationships and conflict style, meaning as adults, they are more likely to use the styles of avoidance and competing in conflict management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cherlin Andrew J. |author2=Chase-Lansdale P.

Despite changing family roles during adolescence, the home environment and parents are still important for the behaviors and choices of adolescents.&lt;ref name="trends"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822130027/http://www.childtrends.org/Files/FamilyEnvironmentRB.pdf|title=The Family Environment and Adolescent Well-being: Exposure to Positive and Negative Family Influences|archivedate=2006-08-22|url=http://www.childtrends.org/Files/FamilyEnvironmentRB.pdf|date=June 2006|publisher=NAHIC|author1=Aufseeser, Dena|author2=Jekielek, Susan|author3=Brown, Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents who have a good relationship with their parents are less likely to engage in various risk behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, fighting, and/or unprotected [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name = "trends" /&gt;
In addition, parents influence the education of adolescence. A study conducted by Adalbjarnardottir and Blondal (2009) showed that adolescents at the age of 14 who identify their parents as authoritative figures are more likely to complete secondary education by the age of 22—as support and encouragement from an authoritative parent motivates the adolescence to complete schooling to avoid disappointing that parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adalbjarnardottir S. |author2=Blondal K.S. | year = 2009 | title = Parenting practices and school dropout: a longitudinal study | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 44 | issue = | page = 176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer groups are essential to social and general development.

An Examination of Social Goals, Coping With Friends, and Social Adjustment. ''[[Journal of Early Adolescence]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A three-factor structure of dealing with friends including avoidance, mastery, and nonchalance has shown that adolescents use friends as coping devices with social stresses.

Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent's own self-concept.&lt;ref name="Swanson"/&gt; Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Peer-groups.html |title=Peer groups - children, therapy, adults, drug, people, skills, effect, women |publisher=Minddisorders.com |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18020830|year=2007|last1=Steinberg|first1=L|last2=Monahan|first2=KC|title=Age Differences in Resistance to Peer Influence|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1531–43|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1531|pmc=2779518|journal=Developmental Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carlo G. |author2=Mestre M.

Adolescents tend to associate with "cliques" on a small scale and "crowds" on a larger scale. During early adolescence, adolescents often associate in [[Adolescent cliques|cliques]], exclusive, single-sex groups of peers with whom they are particularly close. Despite the common{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} notion that cliques are an inherently negative influence, they may help adolescents become socially acclimated and form a stronger sense of identity. Within a clique of highly athletic male-peers, for example, the clique may create a stronger sense of fidelity and competition. Cliques also have become somewhat a "collective parent", i.e. telling the adolescents what to do and not to do.&lt;ref&gt;Grier, Peter. "The Heart of a High School: Peers As Collective Parent."

Web. 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards late adolescence, cliques often merge into mixed-sex groups as teenagers begin romantically engaging with one another.&lt;ref name="Connolly J 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Connolly J. |author2=Craig W. |author3=Goldberg A. |author4=Pepler D. | year = 2004 | title = Mixed-gender groups, dating, and romantic relationships in early adolescence | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 185–207 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01402003.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These small friend groups then break down further as socialization becomes more couple-oriented. On a larger scale, adolescents often associate with ''crowds'', groups of individuals who share a common interest or activity. Often, crowd identities may be the basis for stereotyping young people, such as [[Jock (athlete)|jocks]] or [[nerd]]s. In large, multi-ethnic high schools, there are often ethnically determined crowds.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B., &amp; Mounts, N. (1989, April). "Peer groups structures in single versus multiethnic high schools". Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; While crowds are very influential during early and middle adolescence, they lose salience during high school as students identify more individually.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, R.W. (1979). ''Suburban youth in cultural crisis''. New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of communication is the channel used. ''Channel'', in this respect, refers to the form of communication, be it face-to-face, email, text message, phone or other. Teens are heavy users of newer forms of communication such as text message and social-networking websites such as Facebook, especially when communicating with peers.&lt;ref name="Subrahmanyam"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Subrahmanyam| first=Kaveri | last2=Greenfield| first2=Patricia|date= Spring 2008|title= Online Communication and Adolescent Relationships|journal= The Future of Children| volume=18|pages=119–146| doi=10.1353/foc.0.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents use online technology to experiment with emerging identities and to broaden their peer groups, such as increasing the amount of friends acquired on Facebook and other social media sites.&lt;ref name="Swanson"/&gt; Some adolescents use these newer channels to enhance relationships with peers however there can be negative uses as well such as cyberbullying, as mentioned previously, and negative impacts on the family.&lt;ref name="Subrahmanyam"/&gt;

====Romance and sexual activity====
{{Main|Adolescent sexuality}}
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality in the United States}}
[[Intimate relationship|Romantic relationships]] tend to increase in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month over the course of the previous 18 months.&lt;ref name="Carver K. 2003"&gt;Carver K., Joyner K., Udry J.R. (2003). National estimates of adolescent romantic relationships. In ''Adolescent Romantic Relationships and Sexual Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practical Implications'', 291–329.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 study conducted by [[YouGov]] for [[Channel 4]], 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="sex stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/teen-sex-survey|title=Teen Sex Survey|accessdate=2008-09-11|publisher=Channel 4|year=2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080912225248/http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/teen-sex-survey| archivedate= 12 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstrategist.com/productdetails/Sex.SamplePgs.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120093911/http://www.newstrategist.com/productdetails/Sex.SamplePgs.pdf|archivedate=2006-11-20 |title=Seventeen Is the Average Age at First Sexual Intercourse, '&amp;#39;American Sexual Behavior'&amp;#39;, p.4-5 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by [[sexual maturity|sexual maturation]] and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J., &amp; Land, D.

While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.&lt;ref name="Carver K. 2003"/&gt;

Some researchers are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; they want to move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality.{{why|This sounds pov, in itself without an explanation|date=April 2014}} College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there were no significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = O'Sullivan L. F., Cheng M., Brooks-Gunn J., Mantsun K. Harris | year = 2007 | title = I wanna hold your hand: The progression of social, romantic and sexual events in adolescent relationships | url = | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 100–107 | doi = 10.1363/3910007 | pmid = 17565623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;

Adolescence marks a time of sexual maturation, which manifests in social interactions as well. While adolescents may engage in [[casual sex|casual sexual encounters]] (often referred to as hookups), most sexual experience during this period of development takes place within romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Manning W. |author2=Longmore M. |author3=Giordano P. | year = 2000 | title = The relationship context of contraceptive use at first intercourse | url = | journal = Family Planning Perspectives | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 104–110 | doi = 10.2307/2648158 | pmid = 10894255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents can use technologies and social media to seek out romantic relationships as they feel it is a safe place to try out dating and identity exploration. From these social media encounters, a further relationship may begin.&lt;ref name="Swanson"/&gt; Kissing, hand holding, and hugging signify satisfaction and commitment. Among young adolescents, "heavy" sexual activity, marked by genital stimulation, is often associated with violence, depression, and poor relationship quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Welsh D.

For older adolescents, though, sexual activity in the context of romantic relationships was actually correlated with lower levels of deviant behavior after controlling for genetic risks, as opposed to sex outside of a relationship (hook-ups)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harden K. |author2=Mendle J. | year = 2011 | title = Adolescent sexual activity and the development of delinquent behavior: The role of relationship context | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 40 | issue = 7| pages = 825–838 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-010-9601-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dating abuse|Dating violence]] is fairly prevalent within adolescent relationships. When surveyed, 10-45% of adolescents reported having experienced physical violence in the context of a relationship while a quarter to a third of adolescents reported having experiencing psychological aggression. This reported aggression includes hitting, throwing things, or slaps, although most of this physical aggression does not result in a medical visit. Physical aggression in relationships tends to decline from high school through college and young adulthood. In heterosexual couples, there is no significant difference between the rates of male and female aggressors, unlike in adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halpern C. |author2=Oslak S. |author3=Young M. |author4=Martin S. |author5=Kupper L. | year = 2001 | title = Partner violence among adolescents in opposite-sex romantic: Findings from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 91 | issue = 10| pages = 1679–1685 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.91.10.1679 | pmid = 11574335 | pmc = 1446854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halpern C. |author2=Young M. |author3=Waller M. |author4=Martin S. |author5=Kupper L. | year = 2004 | title = Prevalence of partner violence in same-sex romantic and sexual relationships in a national sample of adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 124–131 | pmid = 15261641 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2003.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Collins W.

Adolescent girls with male partners who are older than them are at higher risk for adverse sexual health outcomes than their peers. Research suggests that the larger the partner age difference, the less relationship power the girls experience. Behavioral interventions such as developing relationship skills in identifying, preventing, and coping with controlling behaviors may be beneficial. For condom use promotion, it is important to identify decision-making patterns within relationships and increase the power of the adolescent female in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Volpe EM, Hardie T, Cerulli C, Sommers MS, Morrison-Beedy D. What's age got to do with it? Partner age difference, power, intimate partner violence, and sexual risk in urban adolescents. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2013; 28(10): 2068-2087&lt;/ref&gt; Female adolescents from minority populations are at even higher risk for [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV). Recent research findings suggest that a substantial portion of young urban females are at high risk for being victims of multiple forms of IPV. Practitioners diagnosing depression among urban minority teens should assess for both physical and non-physical forms of IPV, and early detection can help to identify youths in need of intervention and care.&lt;ref&gt;Teitelman AM, Ratcliffe SJ, McDonald CC, Brawner BM, Sullivan C.

Urban adolescent girls’ perspectives on romantic relationships: Initiation, involvement, negotiation and conflict. Issues in Mental Health Nursing, 2014; 35: 776-790&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to adult victims, adolescent victims do not readily disclose abuse, and may seek out medical care for problems not directly related to incidences of IPV. Therefore, screening should be a routine part of medical treatment for adolescents regardless of chief complaint. Many adults discount instances of IPV in adolescents or believe they do not occur because relationships at young ages are viewed as “puppy love,” however, it is crucial that adults take IPV in adolescents seriously even though often policy falls behind.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. Police-documented incidents of intimate partner violence against young women. Journal of Women's Health, 2010; 19: 1079-1087&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]]/diseases (STIs/STDs), including [[HIV/AIDS]], are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as [[teenage pregnancy]] (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI.&lt;ref name="Mulrine, A 2010"&gt;Mulrine, A."Risky Business." U.S. News &amp; World Report. 27 May 2002: 42-49. SIRS Researcher. Web. 25 Oct 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents in the United States often chose "anything but intercourse" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of [[Herpes simplex|herpes]] and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21.&lt;ref name="Mulrine, A 2010"/&gt; Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 [[sex education]] instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]], the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.

==Culture==

===Summary===
[[File:Japan08.07 Shibuya Mybestfriends.jpg|thumb|Japanese ''[[gyaru]]'' girls in Tokyo]]
There are certain characteristics of adolescent development that are more rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures. [[Culture]] has been defined as the "symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=J.V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara.|isbn=1576072053|page=807|author2=Lerner, R.M. |author3= Finkelstein, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects all aspects of an individual's life.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 807"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=807|author2=Rosenberg, Richard M. |author3= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a [[youth culture]].&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 807"/&gt;  For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 807"/&gt; However, "culture" should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group. Furthermore, to avoid [[ethnocentrism]], researchers must be careful not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=271|author2=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, teenagers first came to public attention during the Second World War, when there were fears of juvenile delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Tebbutt, ''Making Youth: A History of Youth in Modern Britain'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, the media presented teenagers in terms of generational rebellion.  The exaggerated moral panic among politicians and the older generation was typically belied by the growth in intergenerational cooperation between parents and children. Many working-class parents, enjoying newfound economic security, eagerly took the opportunity to encourage their teens to enjoy more adventurous lives.&lt;ref&gt;Selina Todd, and Hilary Young. "Baby-Boomers to ‘Beanstalkers’ Making the Modern Teenager in Post-War Britain."

''Cultural and Social History'' 12.4 (2015): 489-507.&lt;/ref&gt; The media distortions of the teens as too affluent, and as promiscuous, delinquent, counter-cultural rebels do not reflect the actual experiences of ordinary young adults, particularly young women.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Mills, "Using the personal to critique the popular: women’s memories of 1960s youth." ''Contemporary British History'' 30#4 (2016): 463-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomy===
The degree to which adolescents are perceived as autonomous beings varies widely by culture, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main types of [[autonomy]]: emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=79|editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= foreword by Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emotional autonomy is defined in terms of an adolescent's relationships with others, and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern. Cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating, social time with peers, and time-management decisions.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Cognitive autonomy describes the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health, high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and self-initiating and regulating behaviors.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Furthermore, it has been found that adolescents' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy match closely with those of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Juang, L., Lerner, J. McKinney, J., &amp; von Eye, A. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

A questionnaire called the teen timetable has been used to measure the age at which individuals believe adolescents should be able to engage in behaviors associated with autonomy.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2011"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2011). "Adolescence," 9th ed. 292. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; This questionnaire has been used to gauge differences in cultural perceptions of adolescent autonomy, finding, for instance, that White parents and adolescents tend to expect autonomy earlier than those of Asian descent.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2011"/&gt;  It is, therefore, clear that cultural differences exist in perceptions of adolescent autonomy, and such differences have implications for the lifestyles and development of adolescents. In sub-Saharan African youth, the notions of individuality and freedom may not be useful in understanding adolescent development. Rather, African notions of childhood and adolescent development are relational and interdependent.&lt;ref name="The World's Youth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=B. Bradford|last2=W.

===Social roles and responsibilities===
[[File:Alessandro Allori 003.jpg|thumb|180px|Portrait of a noble girl c. 1571]]
The lifestyle of an adolescent in a given culture is profoundly shaped by the roles and responsibilities he or she is expected to assume. The extent to which an adolescent is expected to share family responsibilities is one large determining factor in normative adolescent behavior. For instance, adolescents in certain cultures are expected to contribute significantly to household chores and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 115"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=115|editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household chores are frequently divided into self-care tasks and family-care tasks. However, specific household responsibilities for adolescents may vary by culture, family type, and adolescent age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=116 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown that adolescent participation in family work and routines has a positive influence on the development of an adolescent's feelings of self-worth, care, and concern for others.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 115"/&gt; 	

In addition to the sharing of household chores, certain cultures expect adolescents to share in their family's financial responsibilities. According to family economic and financial education specialists, adolescents develop sound money management skills through the practices of saving and spending money, as well as through planning ahead for future economic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=44|editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between families in the distribution of financial responsibilities or provision of [[Allowance (money)|allowance]] may reflect various social background circumstances and intrafamilial processes, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values, as well as by the business sector and market economy of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|pages=44–45|editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in many developing countries it is common for children to attend fewer years of formal schooling so that, when they reach adolescence, they can begin working.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, R., &amp; Verma, S. (1999). How children and adolescents spend their time: Time budgest for locations, activities, and companionship. "American Journal of Community Psychology, 29", 565-597.&lt;/ref&gt;

While adolescence is a time frequently marked by participation in the workforce, the number of adolescents in the workforce is much lower now than in years past as a result of increased accessibility and perceived importance of formal higher education.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2005"&gt;National Research Council. (2005). "Growing up global". Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, half of all 16-year-olds in China were employed in 1980, whereas less than one fourth of this same cohort were employed in 1990.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2005"/&gt;	
 	
Furthermore, the amount of time adolescents spend on work and leisure activities varies greatly by culture as a result of cultural norms and expectations, as well as various socioeconomic factors. American teenagers spend less time in school or working and more time on leisure activities—which include playing sports, socializing, and caring for their appearance—than do adolescents in many other countries.&lt;ref name="Larson, R. 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Larson R. |author2=Verma S. | year = 1999 | title = How children and adolescents spend time across the world:Work, play, and developmental opportunities | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 125 | issue = 6| pages = 701–736 | pmid = 10589300 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.701}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences may be influenced by cultural values of education and the amount of responsibility adolescents are expected to assume in their family or community.

Time management, financial roles, and social responsibilities of adolescents are therefore closely connected with the education sector and processes of career development for adolescents, as well as to cultural norms and social expectations. In many ways, adolescents' experiences with their assumed social roles and responsibilities determine the length and quality of their initial pathway into adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=101 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief system development===
Adolescence is frequently characterized by a transformation of an adolescent's understanding of the world, the rational direction towards a life course, and the active seeking of new ideas rather than the unquestioning acceptance of adult authority.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 577"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=577 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An adolescent begins to develop a unique [[belief system]] through his or her interaction with social, familial, and cultural environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|pages=577–579 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While organized religion is not necessarily a part of every adolescent's life experience, youth are still held responsible for forming a set of beliefs about themselves, the world around them, and whatever higher powers they may or may not believe in.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 577"/&gt; This process is often accompanied or aided by cultural traditions that intend to provide a meaningful transition to adulthood through a ceremony, ritual, confirmation, or [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=578 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Many cultures define the transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, [[menarche]] (the first menstrual period of a female), or [[semenarche]] (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. In the United States specifically, adolescents are said to have "raging hormones" that drive their sexual desires. These sexual desires are then dramatized regarding [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sex]] and seen as "a site of danger and risk; that such danger and risk is a source of profound worry among adults".&lt;ref&gt;[Fields, J. (2012). Sexuality Education in the United States: Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide. Retrieved April 28, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is little to no normalization regarding teenagers having sex in the U.S., which causes conflict in how adolescents are taught about [[sex education]]. There is a constant debate about whether [[abstinence-only sex education]] or [[comprehensive sex education]] should be taught in schools and this stems back to whether or not the country it is being taught in is permissive or restrictive. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through [[Public humiliation|public shaming]] and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur.&lt;ref name="Connolly J 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford, C. 1951"&gt;Ford, C. &amp; Beach, F. (1951). "Patterns of sexual behavior". New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or [[teenage pregnancy]], as long as they occur after marriage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2011). "Adolescence", 9th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is—in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, L., Savin- Williams, R. (2009). Adolescent Sexuality. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinberg (Eds.), "Handbook of adolescent psychology" (3rd ed., Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;479–523). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth face much discrimination through bullying from those unlike them and may find telling others that they are gay to be a traumatic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Andy (2013). "Youth Studies", New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of sexual attitudes that a culture embraces could thus be seen to affect the beliefs, lifestyles, and societal perceptions of its adolescents.

===Legal issues, rights and privileges===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}

====General issues====
[[File:2009-04-13 Cherry Pie sign.jpg|thumb|A sign outside a [[sex shop]] reads "Must Be 18 To Enter" in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].]]
Adolescence is a period frequently marked by increased rights and privileges for individuals. While cultural variation exists for legal rights and their corresponding ages, considerable consistency is found across cultures. Furthermore, since the advent of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 (children here defined as under 18), almost every country in the world (except the U.S. and South Sudan) has legally committed to advancing an anti-discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages. This includes protecting children against unchecked [[child labor]], enrollment in the [[military]], [[prostitution]], and [[pornography]].
In many societies, those who reach a certain age (often 18, though this varies) are considered to have reached the [[age of majority]] and are legally regarded as [[adults]] who are responsible for their actions. People below this age are considered [[Minor (law)|minors]] or [[child]]ren. A person below the age of majority may gain adult rights through [[Emancipation of minors|legal emancipation]].

The [[legal working age]] in Western countries is usually 14 to 16, depending on the number of hours and type of employment under consideration. Many countries also specify a minimum [[school leaving age]], at which a person is legally allowed to leave [[compulsory education]]. This age varies greatly cross-culturally, spanning from 10 to 18, which further reflects the diverse ways formal education is viewed in cultures around the world.

In most democratic countries, a citizen is [[Voting age|eligible to vote]] at age 18. In a minority of countries, the voting age is as low as 16 (for example, [[Brazil]]), and at one time was as high as 25 in [[Uzbekistan]].

The [[age of consent]] to sexual activity varies widely between jurisdictions, ranging from 12 to 20 years, as does the [[marriageable age|age at which people are allowed to marry]].&lt;ref name="ageofconsent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm |title=Ageofconsent.com |publisher=Ageofconsent.com |accessdate=2012-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023184559/http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific legal ages for adolescents that also vary by culture are enlisting in the military, gambling, and the purchase of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[cigarette]]s or items with parental advisory labels.
It should be noted that the legal coming of age often does not correspond with the sudden realization of autonomy; many adolescents who have legally reached adult age are still dependent on their guardians or peers for emotional and financial support. Nonetheless, new legal privileges converge with shifting social expectations to usher in a phase of heightened independence or social responsibility for most legal adolescents.

====Alcohol and illicit drug use====

=====Prevalence=====
Following a steady decline, beginning in the late 1990s up through the mid-2000s, illicit drug use among adolescents has been on the rise in the U.S.  Aside from alcohol, [[marijuana]] is the most commonly indulged drug habit during adolescent years. Data collected by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] shows that between the years of 2007 and 2011, marijuana use grew from 5.7% to 7.2% among 8th grade students; among 10th grade students, from 14.2% to 17.6%; and among 12th graders, from 18.8% to 22.6%.&lt;ref name="NIDA"&gt;[http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/high-school-youth-trends], National Institute of Drug Abuse. (2012, July). "Drugfacts: High school and youth."&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional, recent years have seen a surge in popularity of [[MDMA]]; between 2010 and 2011, the use of MDMA increased from 1.4% to 2.3% among high school seniors.&lt;ref name="NIDA" /&gt; The heightened usage of ecstasy most likely ties in at least to some degree with the rising popularity of [[Rave|rave culture]].

One significant contribution to the increase in teenage [[substance abuse]] is an increase in the availability of [[Prescription drug|prescription medication]]. With an increase in the diagnosis of behavioral and attentional disorders for students, taking pharmaceutical drugs such as Vicodin and Adderall for pleasure has become a prevalent activity among adolescents: 15.2% of high school seniors report having abused prescription drugs within the past year.&lt;ref name="NIDA" /&gt;

Teenage alcohol drug use is currently at an all-time low.  Out of a polled body of students, 4.4% of 8th graders reported having been on at least one occasion been drunk within the previous month; for 10th graders, the number was 13.7%, and for 12th graders, 25%.&lt;ref name="NIDA" /&gt;  More drastically, cigarette smoking has become a far less prevalent activity among American middle- and high-school students; in fact, a greater number of teens now smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes, with one recent study showing a respective 15.2% versus 11.7% of surveyed students.&lt;ref name="NIDA" /&gt;  Recent studies have shown that male late adolescents are far more likely to smoke cigarettes rather than females. The study indicated that there was a discernible gender difference in the prevalence of smoking among the students. The finding of the study show that more males than females began smoking when they were in primary and high schools whereas most females started smoking after high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mashamba|first1=Tshilidzi|last2=Mudhovozi|first2=Pilot|last3=Sodi|first3=Tholene|title=Gender differences in cigarette smoking among college students|journal=African Journal for Physical, Health Education, Recreation and Dance|date=September 2012|pages=117–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be attributed to recent changing social and political views towards marijuana; issues such as medicinal use and legalization have tended towards painting the drug in a more positive light than historically, while cigarettes continue to be vilified due to associated health risks.

Different drug habits often relate to one another in a highly significant manner. It has been demonstrated that adolescents who drink at least to some degree may be as much as sixteen times more likely than non-drinkers to experiment with illicit drugs.&lt;ref name="Greenblatt"&gt;{{cite report |author=Greenblatt, Janet C. |author-link= |authors= |date=2000 |title= Patterns of Alcohol Use Among Adolescents and Associations with Emotional and Behavioral Problems|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.365.6700&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |publisher=Office of Applied Studies, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |page= |docket= |access-date=2018-06-29 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Social influence=====
[[File:Night Life in Cork, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Irish teenagers over 18 hanging around outside a bar. People under 18 are not allowed to drink outside the home; this is not strictly enforced in Ireland.]]
Peer acceptance and social norms gain a significantly greater hand in directing behavior at the onset of adolescence; as such, the alcohol and illegal drug habits of teens tend to be shaped largely by the substance use of friends and other classmates.  In fact, studies suggest that more significantly than actual drug norms, an individual's perception of the illicit drug use by friends and peers is highly associated with his or her own habits in substance use during both middle and high school, a relationship that increases in strength over time.&lt;ref name="Duan et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duan|first=L.|author2=Chou, C.|author3=Andreeva, V.|author4=Pentz, M.|title=Trajectories of Peer Social Influences as Long-term Predictors of Drug Use from Early Through Late Adolescence|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=July 2009|volume=38|issue=3|pages=454–465|doi=10.1007/s10964-008-9310-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas social influences on alcohol use and marijuana use tend to work directly in the short term, peer and friend norms on smoking cigarettes in middle school have a profound effect on one's own likelihood to smoke cigarettes well into high school.&lt;ref name="Duan et al" /&gt;  Perhaps the strong correlation between peer influence in middle school and cigarette smoking in high school may be explained by the addictive nature of cigarettes, which could lead many students to continue their smoking habits from middle school into late adolescence.

=====Demographic factors=====
Until mid-to-late adolescence, boys and girls show relatively little difference in drinking motives.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuntsche|first=E.|author2=Knibbe, R.|author3=Gmel, G.|author4=Engels, R.|title=Who drinks and why? A review of socio-demographic, personality, and contextual issues behind the drinking motives in young people|journal=Addictive Behaviors|year=2006|volume=31|issue=10|pages=1844–1857|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2005.12.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distinctions between the reasons for alcohol consumption of males and females begin to emerge around ages 14–15; overall, boys tend to view drinking in a more social light than girls, who report on average a more frequent use of alcohol as a coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt; The latter effect appears to shift in late adolescence and onset of early adulthood (20–21 years of age); however, despite this trend, age tends to bring a greater desire to drink for pleasure rather than coping in both boys and girls.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;

Drinking habits and the motives behind them often reflect certain aspects of an individual's personality; in fact, four dimensions of the [[Big Five personality traits|Five-Factor Model]] of personality demonstrate associations with drinking motives (all but 'Openness').  Greater enhancement motives for alcohol consumption tend to reflect high levels of extraversion and sensation-seeking in individuals; such enjoyment motivation often also indicates low conscientiousness, manifesting in lowered inhibition and a greater tendency towards aggression.  On the other hand, drinking to cope with negative emotional states correlates strongly with high neuroticism and low agreeableness.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;  Alcohol use as a negative emotion control mechanism often links with many other behavioral and emotional impairments, such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;

Research has generally shown striking uniformity across different cultures in the motives behind teen alcohol use. Social engagement and personal enjoyment appear to play a fairly universal role in adolescents' decision to drink throughout separate cultural contexts.  Surveys conducted in Argentina, Hong Kong, and Canada have each indicated the most common reason for drinking among adolescents to relate to pleasure and recreation; 80% of Argentinian teens reported drinking for enjoyment, while only 7% drank to improve a bad mood.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;  The most prevalent answers among Canadian adolescents were to "get in a party mood," 18%; "because I enjoy it," 16%; and "to get drunk," 10%.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;  In Hong Kong, female participants most frequently reported drinking for social enjoyment, while males most frequently reported drinking to feel the effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;

===Media===

====Body image====
[[File:Teenage girl texting.jpg|160px|thumb|Teenage girl texting]]
Much research has been conducted on the psychological ramifications of [[body image]] on adolescents. Modern day teenagers are exposed to more media on a daily basis than any generation before them. Recent studies have indicated that the average teenager watches roughly 1500 hours of television per year.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html], TV-Free America. (2007). Television and Health. In ''The Sourcebook for Teaching Science.'' Retrieved 2012, from http://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, modern day adolescents are exposed to many representations of ideal, societal beauty. The concept of a person being unhappy with their own image or appearance has been defined as "body dissatisfaction". In teenagers, body dissatisfaction is often associated with body mass, low [[self-esteem]], and atypical eating patterns.&lt;ref name="Makinen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mäkinen | first1 = M | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Body dissatisfaction and body mass in girls and boys transitioning from early to mid-adolescence: additional role of self-esteem and eating habits | url = | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 35 | doi=10.1186/1471-244x-12-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars continue to debate the effects of media on body dissatisfaction in teens.&lt;ref name="Ata"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ata | first1 = R.

====Media profusion====

Because exposure to media has increased over the past decade, adolescents' utilization of computers, cell phones, stereos and televisions to gain access to various mediums of [[popular culture]] has also increased. Almost all American households have at least one television, more than three-quarters of all adolescents' homes have access to the Internet, and more than 90% of American adolescents use the Internet at least occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenhart|first=Amanda|title=Teens and social media|journal=Pew Internet and American Life Project|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the amount of time adolescents spend using these devices, their total media exposure is high. In the last decade, the amount of time that adolescents spend on the computer has greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=M|title=Trajectories of perceived adult and peer discrimination among Black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents: patterns and psychological correlates.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=March 2006|volume=42|pages=391–396|pmid=16569162|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.2.218|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online activities with the highest rates of use among adolescents are video games (78% of adolescents), email (73%), instant messaging (68%), social networking sites (65%), news sources (63%), music (59%), and videos (57%).

====Social networking====

In the 2000s, social networking sites proliferated and a high proportion of adolescents used them: as of 2012 73% of 12–17 year olds reported having at least one social networking profile;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reich|first=Stephanie M.|author2=Kaveri Subrahmanyam |author3=Guadalupe Espinoza|title=Friending, IMing, and Hanging Out Face-to-Face: Overlap in Adolescents' Online and Offline Social Networks|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=March 2012|volume=48|issue=2|pages=356–368|doi=10.1037/a0026980|pmid=22369341}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-thirds (68%) of teens texted every day, half (51%) visited social networking sites daily, and 11% sent or received tweets at least once every day. More than a third (34%) of teens visited their main social networking site several times a day. One in four (23%) teens were "heavy" social media users, meaning they used at least two different types of social media each and every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teens are avid, daily users of social media|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/social-media-social-life/key-finding-1%3A-teens-are-avid,-daily-users-of-social-media|work=Social Media, Social Life: How Teens View Their Digital Lives|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research has been inconclusive, some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents' social development, replaces face-to-face communication, impairs their social skills, and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers. A 2015 review reported that "adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyberbullying, which has been consistently associated with an increased likelihood of depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamm|first1=MP|last2=Newton|first2=AS|last3=Chisholm|first3=A|last4=Shulhan|first4=J|last5=Milne|first5=A|last6=Sundar|first6=P|last7=Ennis|first7=H|last8=Scott|first8=SD|last9=Hartling|first9=L|title=Prevalence and Effect of Cyberbullying on Children and Young People: A Scoping Review of Social Media Studies|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|date=22 June 2015|pmid=26098362|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0944|volume=169|issue=8|pages=770–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents' social functioning. Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable, while socializing in [[Internet café]]s seems only to affect boys academic achievement. However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for [[Social anxiety|socially anxious]] teens, who find it easier to interact socially online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Su-Yen|author2=Fu, Yang-Chih|title=Internet use and academic achievement in early adolescence|journal=Adolescence|year=2009|volume=44|issue=176|pages=797–812|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;hid=107&amp;sid=fa31d0ca-f7e6-4ad5-b0e8-a5030d690614%40sessionmgr115&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=sih&amp;AN=47715864|accessdate=4 October 2012|pmid=20432601}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities. However, the Internet can be significantly useful in educating teens because of the access they have to information on many various topics.

===Transitions into adulthood===
{{see|Leaving the nest}}
[[File:Da Nang, Vietnam. A young Marine private waits on the beach during the Marine landing. - NARA - 532432 (restored).jpg|thumbnail|160px|A young U.S. Marine in the [[Vietnam War]], 1965]]
A broad way of defining adolescence is the transition from child-to-adulthood. According to Hogan &amp; Astone (1986), this transition can include markers such as leaving school, starting a full-time job, leaving the home of origin, getting married, and becoming a parent for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, N. (2000). "Pathways To Adulthood In Changing Societies: Variabilities and Mechanisms in Life Course Perspective"Annu. Rev. Sociol. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture. In some countries, such as the United States, adolescence can last nearly a decade, but in others, the transition—often in the form of a ceremony—can last for only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2011). "Adolescence", 9th ed. 101. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of social and religious transition ceremonies that can be found in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are [[Confirmation]], [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]s, [[Quinceañera]]s, [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteens]], [[cotillion]]s, and [[débutante]] balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.

==Promoting positive changes in adolescents==
At the decision-making point of their lives, youth is susceptible to drug addiction, sexual abuse, peer pressure, violent crimes and other illegal activities. Developmental Intervention Science (DIS) is a fusion of the literature of both developmental and intervention sciences. This association conducts youth interventions that mutually assist both the needs of the community as well as psychologically stranded youth by focusing on risky and inappropriate behaviors while promoting positive self-development along with self-esteem among adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;"The initiative to promote positive changes in youth".

The concept of adolescence has been criticized by experts, such as [[Robert Epstein]], who state that an undeveloped brain is not the main cause of teenagers' turmoils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drrobertepstein.com/pdf/Epstein-THE_MYTH_OF_THE_TEEN_BRAIN-Scientific_American_Mind-4-07.pdf|title=Dr. Robert Epstein: The myth of the teen brain - Psychology Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/why-its-time-to-lay-the-stereotype-of-the-teen-brain-to-rest-85888|title=Why it's time to lay the stereotype of the 'teen brain' to rest|last=Romer|first=Dan|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have criticized the concept of adolescence because it is a relatively recent phenomenon in human history created by modern society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199501/the-invention-adolescence|title=The Invention of Adolescence|magazine=Psychology Today|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ482132|title=On the "Invention" of Adolescence.|last=Fasick|first=Frank A.|journal=Journal of Early Adolescence|volume=14|number=1|pages=6–23|date=February 1994|doi=10.1177/0272431694014001002}} "[...] the application of technology to increase productivity, the affluence generated by it, and the related structural changes in society have contributed to the creation of adolescence in the North American urban-industrial society."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Teen_2_0.html?id=OENf1J45SS0C|title=Teen 2.0: Saving Our Children and Families from the Torment of Adolescence|last=Epstein|first=Robert|publisher=Linden Publishing|date=2010|isbn=1610351010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demos|first1=John|last2=Demos|first2=Virginia|date=1969|title=Adolescence in Historical Perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=31|pages=632–638|doi=10.2307/349302|jstor=349302|via=|number=4}} "The idea of adolescence is today one of our most widely held and deeply imbedded assumptions about the process of human development. Indeed most of us treat it not as an idea but as a ''fact''. [...] The concept of adolescence, as generally understood and applied, did not exist before the last two decades of the nineteenth century."&lt;/ref&gt; and have been highly critical of what they view as the [[infantilization]] of young adults in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.fortroubledteens.com/the-danger-of-treating-teens-like-children.html|title=The Danger of Treating Teens Like Children|website=help.fortroubledteens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[Scientific American]]'', Robert Epstein and Jennifer Ong state that "American-style teen turmoil is absent in more than 100 cultures around the world, suggesting that such mayhem is not biologically inevitable. Second, the brain itself changes in response to experiences, raising the question of whether adolescent brain characteristics are the cause of teen tumult or rather the result of lifestyle and experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-teens-who-behave-reck/|title=Are the Brains of Reckless Teens More Mature Than Those of Their Prudent Peers?|author1-last=Epstein|author1-first=Robert|author2-last=Ong|author2-first=Jennifer|magazine=Scientific American|date=August 25, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Moshman has also stated in regards to adolescence that brain research "is crucial for a full picture, but it [[Correlation does not imply causation|does not provide an ultimate explanation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-moshman/adolescents-and-their-tee_b_858360.html|title=The Teenage Brain: Debunking the 5 Biggest Myths|last=Moshman|first=David|date=2011-05-17|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of the concept of adolescence do point at individual differences in brain growth rate, citing that some (though not all) early teens still have infantile undeveloped [[corpus callosum]]s, concluding that "the adult in *every* adolescent" is too generalizing. These people tend to support the notion that a more interconnected [[brain]] makes more precise distinctions (citing [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s comparisons of [[conditioned reflex]]es in different species) and that there is a [[critical phenomena|non-arbitrary threshold]] at which distinctions become sufficiently precise to correct assumptions afterward as opposed to being ultimately dependent on exterior assumptions for communication. They argue that this threshold is the one at which an individual is objectively capable of speaking for himself or herself, as opposed to culturally arbitrary measures of "maturity" which often treat this ability as a sign of "immaturity" merely because it leads to questioning of authorities. These people also stress the low probability of the threshold being reached at a birthday, and instead advocate non-chronological emancipation at the threshold of afterward correction of assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Richard W.|date=1988|title=Ethics without Indoctrination.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ373375|journal=Educational Leadership|language=en|volume=45|issue=8|pages=10–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes cite similarities between "adolescent" behavior and [[KZ syndrome]] (inmate behavior in adults in prison camps) such as aggression being explainable by oppression and "immature" financial or other risk behavior being explainable by a way out of captivity being more worth to captive people than any incremental improvement in captivity, and argue that this theory successfully predicted remaining "immature" behavior after reaching the [[age of majority]] by means of longer-term traumatization. In this context, they refer to the [[fallibility]] of official assumptions about what is good or bad for an individual, concluding that [[paternalism|paternalistic]] "rights" may harm the individual. They also argue that since it never took many years to move from one group to another to avoid inbreeding in the [[paleolithic]], [[evolutionary psychology]] is unable to account for a long period of "immature" risk behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51633820|title=The Thinker's Guide to Ethical Reasoning|last=Paul|first=Richard W.|last2=Elder|first2=Linda|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking|others=|year=2013|isbn=0944583172|edition=2nd|location=Dillon Beach, CA|pages=|oclc=51633820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-schooling activism''' or '''radical education reform''' seeks to abolish [[compulsory education|compulsory schooling]] laws.

==Arguments==

===Teaching as political control===

A non-curriculum, non-instructional method of teaching was advocated by [[Neil Postman]] and Charles Weingartner in their book ''Teaching as a Subversive Activity''. In [[inquiry education]] students are encouraged to ask questions which are meaningful to them, and which do not necessarily have easy answers; teachers are encouraged to avoid giving answers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil, and Weingartner, Charles (1969), Teaching as a Subversive Activity, Dell, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray N. Rothbard]] argues that the history of the drive for [[compulsory schooling]] is not guided by altruism, but by a desire to coerce the population into a mold desired by "The Establishment".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}{{clarify|date=July 2017}}

[[John Caldwell Holt]] asserts that youths should have the right to control and direct their own learning, and that the current compulsory schooling system violates a basic fundamental right of humans: the right to decide what enters our minds. He thinks that freedom of learning is part of [[freedom of thought]], even more fundamental a human right than [[freedom of speech]]. He especially states that forced schooling, regardless of whether the student is learning anything whatsoever, or if the student could more effectively learn elsewhere in different ways, is a gross violation of civil liberties (Holt, 1974).

[[Nathaniel Branden]] adduces government should not be permitted to remove children forcibly from their homes, with or without the parents' consent, and subject the children to educational training and procedures of which the parents may or may not approve. He also claims that citizens should not have their wealth expropriated to support an educational system which they may or may not sanction, and to pay for the education of children who are not their own. He claims this must be true for anyone who understands and is consistently committed to the principle of [[individual rights]]. He asserts that the disgracefully low level of education in America today is the predictable result of a state-controlled school system, and that the solution is to bring the field of education into the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Branden, N. (1963). Public Education, Should Education be Compulsory and Tax Supported, as it is Today? Chapter 5, Common Fallacies About Capitalism, [[Ayn Rand]], [[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The corruption of children – Rousseau===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] wrote in his book ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'' that all children are perfectly designed organisms, ready to learn from their surroundings so as to grow into virtuous adults, but due to the malign influence of corrupt society, they often fail to do so. Rousseau advocated an educational method which consisted of removing the child from society—for example, to a country home—and alternately conditioning him through changes to environment and setting traps and puzzles for him to solve or overcome.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Rousseau was unusual in that he recognized and addressed the potential of a problem of legitimation for teaching. He advocated that adults always be truthful with children, and in particular that they never hide the fact that the basis for their authority in teaching was purely one of physical coercion: "I'm bigger than you." Once children reached the age of reason, at about 12, they would be engaged as free individuals in the ongoing process of their own.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Grading – Illich===
In ''[[Deschooling Society]]'', [[Ivan Illich]] calls for the disestablishment of schools. He claims that schooling confuses teaching with learning, grades with education, diplomas with competence, attendance with attainment, and, especially, process with substance. He writes that schools do not reward real achievement, only processes. Schools inhibit a person’s will and ability to self-learn, ultimately resulting in psychological impotence. He claims that forced schooling perverts the victims’ natural inclination to grow and learn and replaces it with the demand for instruction. Further, the current model of schooling, replete with credentials, betrays the value of a self-taught individual. Moreover, institutionalized schooling seeks to quantify the unquantifiable – human growth.

=== Effects on local culture and economics  ===
In some cases schooling has been used as a tool for assimilation and a both deliberate and inadvertent tool to change local culture and economics into another form. Opponents of this effect argue it is a human right for a culture to be maintained, and education can violate this human right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66455/|title=Indigenous education and human rights|last=Noam|first=Schimmel,|date=2007-01-01|website=eprints.lse.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forced schooling has been used to forcibly assimilate Native Americans in the [[American Indian boarding schools|United States]] and [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canada]], which some have said is [[cultural genocide]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/world/americas/canadas-forced-schooling-of-aboriginal-children-was-cultural-genocide-report-finds.html|title=Canada’s Forced Schooling of Aboriginal Children Was ‘Cultural Genocide,’ Report Finds|last=Austen|first=Ian|date=2015-06-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf|title=American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing|last=Jones|first=Jennifer|last2=Bosworth|first2=Dee Ann|date=2011|website=|publisher=Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways|access-date=|last3=Lonetree|first3=Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many psychologists believe the forced assimilation of native cultures has contributed to their high suicide rates and poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb07/astruggle.aspx|title='A struggle for hope'|website=apa.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Western education encourages Western modes of survival and economic systems, which can be worse and poorer than the existing modes of survival and economic systems of an existing culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.webster.edu/corbetre/philosophy/education/bg/bg-ch-5.html|title=Philosophy of Education -- From: Chapter 5: Schooling in Capitalist America|website=faculty.webster.edu|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eco-action.org/dt/affluent.html|title=neolithic hunter-gatherers: Marshall Sahlins- The Original Affluent  Society|website=www.eco-action.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ineffective or counter to its purpose ===
Some of the proposed purposes of western style compulsory education are to prepare students to join the adult workforce and be financially successful, have students learn useful skills and knowledge, and prepare students to make positive economic or scientific contributions to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/newsletters/education-update/jul12/vol54/num07/What-Is-the-Purpose-of-Education%C2%A2.aspx|title=Education Update:Quality Feedback:What Is the Purpose of Education?|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sec-ed.co.uk/best-practice/what-is-the-purpose-of-education/|title=What is the purpose of education?|website=www.sec-ed.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of schooling say it is ineffective at achieving these purposes and goals.

Instead of being a way out of poverty and a way to stay away from crime, for many, school has the opposite effect. Schooling often perpetuates poverty and class divisions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/15/how-public-schools-demand-failure-and-perpetuate-poverty.html|title=How Public Schools Demand Failure and Perpetuate Poverty|last=Soling|first=Cevin|date=2016-05-15|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hochschild|first=Jennifer L.|date=2016-11-19|title=Social Class in Public Schools|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/jlhochschild/publications/social-class-public-schools|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=59|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At many schools, students are introduced to gangs, drugs and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/183015.pdf|title=Youth Gangs in School|last=Howell|first=James|date=2000|work=Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; Juvenile Justice Bulletin|last2=Lynch|first2=James|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[School-to-prison pipeline|school to prison pipeline]] also converts children into criminals through overly harsh punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/juvenile-justice/school-prison-pipeline|title=School-to-Prison Pipeline|newspaper=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments from truancy and other school related laws also adversely effect students and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whatiscommoncore.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/compulsory-educations-unforeseen-consequences-nebraska-case-studies/|title=Compulsory Education’s Unforeseen Consequences: Nebraska Case Studies|date=2013-07-23|website=COMMON CORE|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/121186/truancy-laws-unfairly-attack-poor-children-and-parents|title=Inexcusable Absences|last=Goldstein|first=Dana|date=2015-03-06|website=New Republic|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2015/06/06/jail-for-missed-days-at-school-the-madne|title=Jail for Missed Days at School?

The '''Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore (BISE Lahore)''' is a secondary and intermediate education examining board in [[Lahore Division]]. It is located at 86 Mozang Road, Lahore. It was established in 1954. The Board's jurisdiction has been confined to the districts of [[Lahore]], [[Kasur]], [[Sheikhupura]] and [[Nankana Sahib]]. The Board is the mainstream of education{{clarify|date=August 2015}} throughout the country. The Lahore Board is considered as the biggest educational board in [[Pakistan]]: around 2 million students are examined every year through this board in matriculation and intermediate exams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biselahore.com/aboutus.htm Establishment ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226101139/http://www.biselahore.com/aboutus.htm |date=February 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Since Pakistan emerged on the map of the world, the examinations of the matriculation and intermediate level were conducted under the aegis of [[University of the Punjab]]. However, through the promulgation of the Punjab University Act (Amendment) Ordinance 1954, the Board of Secondary Education, Punjab was established in the province which took from the said University control of examinations of Secondary, Intermediate and Pakistani &amp; Classical Languages. The first-ever examination for these stages was conducted in the year 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biselahore.com/aboutus.htm Introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226101139/http://www.biselahore.com/aboutus.htm |date=February 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Owing to tremendous increase in the candidature, two more Boards were established at [[Multan]] and [[Sargodha]] under [[West Pakistan]] Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (Multan &amp; Sargodha) Ordinance No.XVII of 1968. As a result of further bifurcation, Boards were also established at [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Gujranwala]]. The re-construction of the Board of Intermediate &amp; Secondary Education, Lahore has been done through the Punjab Boards of Intermediate &amp; Secondary Education Act 1976 (lately amended by Punjab Ordinance No.XLVII) and presently in the administrative setup of the province, nine Boards are functioning at division level.

== Jurisdiction ==
At the time of its inception in 1954, the Board inherited vast territorial jurisdictions for conducting examinations in the provinces of [[Punjab]], [[Baluchistan]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and Northern Areas. To accommodate overseas candidates, the Board also constituted examination centers at [[Kuwait]] and [[Nairobi]] (Kenya).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biselahore.com/aboutus.htm Jurisdiction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226101139/http://www.biselahore.com/aboutus.htm |date=February 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Current jurisdiction of the Board of Intermediate &amp; Secondary Education Lahore has been confined to the districts of Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Cognitive strategies''' are the specific methods that people use to [[Problem solving|solve problems]], including all sorts of reasoning, planning, arithmetic, etc. Importantly, a cognitive strategy need not be all "in the head", but will almost always interact with various aspects of what might be called the "execution context".

==Examples==

A commonly used and elegant example of cognitive strategies comes from small-number addition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990) The adaptive character of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous different ways (i.e., different strategies) by which one can get the sum of two (let's say) one digit numbers, for example 3+4 (=7). The way that most adults would solve this problem is by simply remembering the answer (a "memory" strategy), but a toddler would probably use one of a number of different finger-counting strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R.S., &amp; Shipley, C. (1995). Variation, selection, and cognitive change. In T. Simon &amp; G. Halford (Eds.), Developing cognitive competence: New approaches to process modeling (pp. 31–76). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can represent the first addend (3) on one's left hand by raising three fingers, and then do the same with four fingers on the right hand, and then count up the number of fingers that are raised. But there are many other ways to do this. For example, one can do the same first step (raise three fingers on one's left hand), and then start counting from 4 as one raises four more fingers one at a time on either the right hand, or even starting from the fourth finger on the left hand (which would require continuing from 6 on the right hand). Different strategies may have very different characteristics in terms of their time and space complexity, memory requirements, etc., and therefore in terms of their error characteristics.

Thus, collaborative learning is commonly illustrated when groups of students work together to search for understanding, meaning, or solutions or to create an artifact or product of their learning. Further, collaborative learning redefines traditional student-teacher relationship in the classroom which results in controversy over whether this paradigm is more beneficial than harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Chiu, M. M. (2004). [http://www.gse.buffalo.edu/fas/chiu/pdf/Adapting_Teacher_Interventions.pdf Adapting teacher interventions to student needs during cooperative learning]. American Educational Research Journal, 41, 365-399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding-Smith, T. (1993). Learning together: An introduction to collaborative learning. New York, NY: HarperCollins College Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative learning activities can include collaborative writing, group projects, joint problem solving, debates, study teams, and other activities. The approach is closely related to [[Introduction to Cooperative Learning|cooperative learning]].

== Theoretical background ==
Collaborative learning is rooted in [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s concept of learning called [[zone of proximal development]]. Typically there are tasks that learners can and cannot accomplish. Between these two areas is the zone of proximal development, which is a category of things that a learner can learn but with the help of guidance. The zone of proximal development gives guidance as to what set of skills a learner has that are in the process of maturation. In Vygotsky's definition of zone of proximal development, he highlighted the importance of learning through communication and interactions with others rather than just through independent work.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, Lev. (1997). [http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/vygotsky78.pdf "Interaction between Learning and Development"]. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This has made way for the ideas of group learning, one of which being collaborative learning.

Collaborative learning is very important in achieving critical thinking. According to Gokhale (1995), individuals are able to achieve higher levels of learning and retain more information when they work in a group rather than individually, this applies to both the facilitators of knowledge, the instructors, and the receivers of knowledge, the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative learning enhances critical thinking|last = Gokhale|first = A.A.|date = 1995|journal = Journal of Technology Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Indigenous communities of the Americas illustrate that collaborative learning occurs because individual participation in learning occurs on a horizontal plane where children and adults are equal.&lt;ref&gt;Paradise, R. (1985). Un análisis psicosocial de la motivación y participación emocional en un caso de aprendizaje individual. Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Educativos, XV, 1, 83-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from cooperative learning ==
There has been a split regarding to the differences between collaborative and cooperative learning. Some believe that collaborative learning is similar, yet distinct from cooperative learning. While both models use a division of labor, collaborative learning requires the mutual engagement of all participants and a coordinated effort to solve the problem whereas cooperative learning requires individuals to take responsibility for a specific section and then coordinate their respective parts together.&lt;ref&gt;Dillenbourgh, P., Baker, M., Blaye, A. &amp; O'Malley, C. (1995). The evolution of research on Collaborative Learning. Retrieved February 19, 2008, from CSCL-A brief overview&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposed differentiation is that cooperative learning is typically used for children because it is used to understand the foundations of knowledge while collaborative learning applies to college and university students because it is used to teach non-foundations of learning. Another believed difference is that cooperative learning is a philosophy of interaction where collaborative learning is a structure of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Kyndt, E., Raes, E., Lismont, B., Timmers, F., Cascallar, E., Dochy, F. (2013). A meta-analysis of the effects of face-to-face cooperative learning. Do recent studies falsify or verify earlier findings? Educational Research Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many psychologists have defined cooperative learning and collaborative learning similarly. Both are group learning mechanisms for learners to obtain a set of skills or knowledge. Some notable psychologists that use this definition for both collaborative and cooperative learning are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Slavin, Cooper and more.

==Classroom==
Often, collaborative learning is used as an umbrella term for a variety of approaches in [[education]] that involve joint intellectual effort by students or students and teachers by engaging individuals in interdependent learning activities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B. L., &amp; MacGregor, J. T. (1992). "What Is Collaborative Learning?". National Center on Postsecondary Teaching, Learning, and Assessment at Pennsylvania State University&lt;/ref&gt; Many have found this to be beneficial in helping students learn effectively and efficiently than if the students were to learn independently. Some positive results from collaborative learning activities are students are able to learn more material by engaging with one another and making sure everyone understands, students retain more information from thoughtful discussion, and students have a more positive attitude about learning and each other by working together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/cal/pdf/guiding-principles4.pdf "Wisconsin's Guiding Principles for Teaching and Learning".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraging collaborative learning may also help improve the learning environment in higher education as well. Kenneth Bruffee performed a theoretical analysis on the state of higher education in America. Bruffee aimed to redefine collaborative learning in academia. Simply including more interdependent activities will help the students become more engaged and thoughtful learners, but teaching them that obtaining knowledge is a communal activity itself.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kelly, J. (2002). [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&amp;context=nchcjournal "Collaborative Learning: Higher Education, Interdependence, and the Authority of Knowledge by Kenneth Bruffee: A Critical Study"] Journal of the National Collegiate Honors Council --Online Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared to more traditional methods where students non-interactively receive information from a teacher, cooperative, problem-based learning demonstrated improvement of [[student engagement]] and retention of classroom material.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, M. (2004).[http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/Prince_AL.pdf "Does Active Learning Work? A Review of Research".] J. Engr. Education, 93(3), 223-231.&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis comparing small-group work to individual work in K-12 and college classrooms also found that students working in small groups achieved significantly more than students working individually, and optimal groups for learning tended to be three- to four-member teams with lower-ability students working best in mixed groups and medium-ability students doing best in homogeneous groups. For higher-ability students, group ability levels made no difference.&lt;ref&gt;Lou, Y., Others. (1996).[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ542075&amp;searchtype=keyword&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;accno=EJ542075&amp;_nfls=false&amp;source=ae "Within-Class Grouping: A eta-Analysis".] Review of Educational Research. 66(4), 423-58.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In more than 40 studies of elementary, middle, and high school English classrooms, discussion-based practices improved comprehension of the text and critical-thinking skills for students across ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, J. (2009)[http://www.quality-talk.org/pdf/Murphy_et_al_2009.pdf "Examining the Effects of classroom Discussion on Students' Comprehension of Text: A Meta-Analysis".] Journal of Educational Psychology. 101(3). 760-764.&lt;/ref&gt; Even discussions lasting as briefly as ten minutes with three participants improved perceived understanding of key story events and characters.&lt;ref&gt;Fall, R., Webb, N., Chudowsky, N. (1997).[https://web.archive.org/web/20100703184836/http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/Reports/TECH445.pdf "Group Discussion and Large-Scale Language Arts Assessment: Effects on Students' Comprehension"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workplace ==
The popularity of collaborative learning in the workplace&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Learning in the Workplace: Practical Issues and Concerns|last = Lee|first = H.||last2 = Bonk|first2 = C.J.|date = 2014|journal = International Journal of Advanced Corporate Learning|doi = 10.3991/ijac.v7i2.3850|pmid = |access-date =|volume=7|issue=2|page=10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has increased over the last decade. With the emergence of many new collaborative tools, as well as the cost benefit of being able to reinforce learning in workers and in trainees during collaborative training, many work environments are now looking toward methods that involve collaborating with older employees and giving trainees more of a hands-on approach. Most companies are transitioning from traditional training programs that include instructor-led training sessions or online guided tutorials. Collaborative learning is extremely helpful because it uses past experiences from prior employees to help new trainees get over different challenges.

There are many facets to collaboration in the workplace. It is critical to helping worker's share information with each other and creating strategic planning documents that require multiple inputs. It also allows for forms of vertical integration to find effective ways to synchronize business operations with vendors without being forced to acquire additional businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The nature and effectiveness of collaboration between firms, their customers and suppliers: a supply chain perspective.|last = Singh|first = P.J.|date = 2009|journal = Supply Chain Management: An international Journal|doi = 10.1108/13598540910954539|pmid = |access-date =|volume=14|pages=189–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses still work on the traditional instructor and trainee model and as they transition from one model to another there are many issues that still need to be debugged in the conversation process:
*Need to understand actual interests and concerns regarding collaborating processes, activities and tools
*Reigning leaders and managers must better understand the collaborative tools and processes that can boost productivity
*Become better equipped to design, implement and evaluate collaborative learning environment

Web technologies have been accelerating learner-centered personalized learning environments. This helps knowledge be constructed and shared, instead of just passed down by authorities and passively consumed or ignored. Technologies such as discussion threads, email or electronic bulletin boards by sharing personal knowledge and ideas do not let others refine individual ideas so we need more collaborative tools. Now these tools on Web 2.0 have been able to enhance collaborative learning like no other because it allows individuals to work together to generate, discuss and evaluate evolving ideas. These tools allow for them to find people that are like minded and collaborate with them effortlessly.

According to a collaborative learning study conducted by Lee &amp; Bonk (2014), there are still many issues that are still being resolved when dealing with collaborative learning in a workplace. The goal was to examine corporate personnel, including learning managers and instructors, plus the tools that they use for collaboration. The researchers conducted an online survey to see what aspects of collaborative learning should be investigated, followed by an open discussion forum with 30 corporate personnel. The results showed that collaboration is becoming very necessary in workplaces and tools such as wikis are very commonly used. There is implication for a lot of future work, in order to have collaborative learning be highly effective in the workplace. Some of the unsolved problems they identified:
# Cultural diversity, and accordingly a lack of awareness of cultural norms
# Geographical distance and time zone differences
# Member isolation in virtual teams
# Generation gaps and age differences in the acceptance of collaboration tools
# Lack of technology support for learners
# Lack of learners' awareness about effective collaboration processes and strategies
# Lack of learners' technological skills and knowledge about collaboration tools &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
It is crucial to consider the interactive processes among people, but the most critical point is the construction of new knowledge brought about through joint work.

== Technology ==
Technology has become an important factor in collaborative learning. Over the past ten years, the Internet has allowed for a shared space for groups to communicate. Virtual environments have been critical to allowing people to communicate long-distances but still feel like they are part of the group. Research has been conducted on how technology has helped increase the potential of collaborative learning.One study in particular conducted by Elizabeth Stacey looked at how technology affected the communication of postgraduate students studying a Master of Business Administration (MBA) using computer-mediated communication (CMC). Many of these students were able to still remotely learn even when they were not present on their university campus. The results of the study helped build an online learning environment model but since this research was conducted the Internet has grown extensively and thus new software is changing these means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment|last = Stacy|first = Elizabeth|date = 1999|journal = Journal of Distance Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a development of new technology that support collaborative learning in higher education and the workplace. These tools allow for a strong more power and engaging learning environment. Chickering identified seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education developed by Chickering.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Implementing the Seven Principles: Technology as Lever|last = Chickering &amp; Ehrmann|first = |date = 1996|journal = AAHE Bulletin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these principles are especially important in developing technology for collaboration.
# "Good practice develops reciprocity and cooperation among students,"
# Good practice uses active learning techniques.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Some examples of how technology is being increasingly integrated with technology are as follows:

Collaborative networked learning: according to Findley (1987) "Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL) is that learning which occurs via electronic dialogue between self-directed co-learners and learners and experts. Learners share a common purpose, depend upon each other and are accountable to each other for their success. CNL occurs in interactive groups in which participants actively communicate and negotiate learning with one another within a contextual framework which may be facilitated by an online coach, mentor or group leader.

Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is a relatively new educational paradigm within collaborative learning which uses technology in a learning environment to help mediate and support group interactions in a collaborative learning context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Robotic Instruction: A Graph Teaching Experience|last = Mitnik|first = R.|date = 2009|journal = Computers &amp; Education|doi = 10.1016/j.compedu.2009.02.010|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Recabbaren|first2 = M.|first3 = M.|first4 = A.|last3 = Nussubaum|last4 = Soto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Online discussion processes|last = Chen|first = G.|date = 2008|journal = Computers and Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Chiu|first2 = M.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSCL systems use technology to control and monitor interactions, to regulate tasks, rules, and roles, and to mediate the acquisition of new knowledge.

Collaborative learning using [[Wikipedia]]: Wikipedia is an example of how collaborative learning tools have been extremely beneficial in both the classroom and workplace setting. They are able to change based on how groups think and are able to form into a coherent idea based on the needs of the Wikipedia user.

Collaborative learning in virtual worlds by their nature provide an excellent opportunity for collaborative learning. At first learning in virtual worlds was restricted to classroom meetings and lectures, similar to their counterparts in real life. Now collaborative learning is evolving as companies starting to take advantage of unique features offered by virtual world spaces - such as ability to record and map the flow of ideas,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; use 3D models and virtual worlds mind mapping tools.

==Cultural variations==
There also exists cultural variations in ways of collaborative learning. Research in this area has mainly focused on children in indigenous Mayan communities of the Americas or in San Pedro, Guatemala and European American middle-class communities.

Generally, researchers have found that children in indigenous Mayan communities such as San Pedro typically learn through keenly observing and actively contributing to the mature activities of their community.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Roberts, A.L. (2009). Children's reflections on cultural differences in ways of working together. (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University of California, Santa Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of learning is characterized by the learner's collaborative participation through multi-modal communication [[Nonverbal communication#Culture|verbal and non-verbal]] and observations.&lt;ref name="Roberts"  /&gt; They are highly engaged within their community through focused observation.&lt;ref name="Gaskins"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaskins | first1 = S | year = 2000 | title = Children's daily activities in a mayan village: a culturally grounded description | url = | journal = Cross-Cultural Research | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 375–389 | doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayan parents believe that children learn best by observing and so an attentive child is seen as one who is trying to learn.&lt;ref name="Gaskins"  /&gt; It has also been found that these children are extremely competent and independent in self-maintenance at an early age and tend to receive little pressure from their parents.&lt;ref name="Gaskins"  /&gt;

Research has found that even when Indigenous Mayan children are in a classroom setting, the cultural orientation of indigenous learners shows that observation is a preferred strategy of learning.&lt;ref name="Paradise 91"&gt;Paradise, R. (1991). El conocimiento cultural en el aula: Niños indígenas y su orientación hacia la observación. Infancia y Aprendizaje, 55, 73-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus children and adults in a classroom setting adopt cultural practice and organize learning collaboratively.&lt;ref name="Paradise 91"  /&gt; This is in contrast to the European-American classroom model, which allocates control to teachers/adults allowing them to control classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, S. U. (1983). The invisible culture: Communication in the classroom and community on the warm springs reservation. Longman Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the European American middle-class communities, children typically do not learn through collaborative learning methods. In the classroom, these children generally learn by engaging in initiation-reply-evaluation sequences.&lt;ref name="Roberts"  /&gt; This sequence starts with the teacher initiating an exchange, usually by asking a question. The student then replies, with the teacher evaluating the student's answer.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, M. (1990). Cognitive development and formal schooling: The evidence from cross-cultural research. In L.C. Moll (Ed), Vygotsky and education: Instructional implications and applications of sociohistorical psychology. (89-110). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This way of learning fits with European-American middle-class cultural goals of autonomy and independence that are dominant in parenting styles within European-American middle-class culture.&lt;ref name="Roberts"  /&gt;

===Examples from Indigenous communities in the Americas===

Although learning happens in a variety of ways in indigenous communities, collaborative learning is one of the main methods used in [[Indigenous education|indigenous learning styles]] instead of using European-American approaches to learning. These methods include learning in a horizontal plane where children and adults equally contribute to ideas and activities.

For example, Mayan people of San Pedro use collaboration in order to build upon one another's ideas and activities. Mayan mothers do not act as teachers when completing a task with their children, but instead collaborate with children through [[Learning through play#Culture and Learning Through Play|play]] and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, B., Toma, C. (2009). "Shared thinking: Community and institutional variations. Discourse Processes". DOI: 10.1080/01638539209545000.&lt;/ref&gt; People of this Mayan community use the shared endeavors method more than European-Americans who tend to use the transmit-and-test model more often.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt; The shared endeavors model is when people go off of others ideas{{clarify|date=October 2015}} and learn from them, while the transmit-and-test model is what is used in most American schools when a teacher gives students information and then tests the students on the information.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;  The shared endeavors model is a form of collaborative learning because everyone learns from one another and are able to hear and share others' ideas.

In Nocutzepo, Mexico, indigenous heritage families form collective units where it is generally agreed that children and youth engage in adult cooperative household or community economic practices such as food preparation, child care, participating in markets, agriculture, animal herding, and construction to name a few.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urrieta Jr | first1 = L. | year = 2013 | title = Familia and comunidad-based saberes: Learning in an indigenous heritage community | url = | journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 320–335 | doi=10.1111/aeq.12028}}&lt;/ref&gt; During planting and harvesting season, entire families are out in the fields together where children usually pitch into the activity with smaller tasks alongside adults; however, are always observant when it comes to activities done by adults, such as driving a tractor or handling an axe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These children learn through imitation, observation, listening, pitching in, and doing activities in a social and cultural context.&lt;ref name=name&gt;Urrieta Jr., L. (2013). Familia and comunidad-based saberes: Learning in an indigenous heritage community. Antrhopology &amp; Education Quarterly, 44(3), 320-335. Doi:10.1111/aeq.12028&lt;/ref&gt; When children begin to participate in the daily family/community activities, they form a sense of belonging, especially when they collaborate with adults establishing a more mature integration with their family and community. 
  
Indigenous people of the Americas utilize collaborative learning through their emphasis on role sharing and responsibility sharing within their communities. The Mayan community of San Pedro, Guatemala utilizes flexible leadership that allows children to have an active role in their learning.&lt;ref name="Chavajay"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chavajay | first1 = P | year = 2008 | title = Organizational patterns in problem solving among Mayan fathers and children | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 882–888 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.3.882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children and adults work as cohesive groups when tackling new projects.&lt;ref name="Chavajay"  /&gt; Collaborative learning is prevalent in Indigenous communities due to the integration of children in the daily lives of the adults.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, B., Correa-Chavez, M., &amp; Silva, K. G. (2011). Cultural variation in children's attention and learning. In M.A. Gernsbaber, R. W. Pew, L. M. Hough &amp; J. R. Pomerantz (Eds.), Psychology and the real world: Essays illustrating fundamental contributions to society (pp. 154-163). New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Age is not a determining factor in whether or not individuals are incorporated into collaborative efforts and learning that occurs in indigenous communities.

Participation of learner is a key component to collaborative learning as it functions as the method by which the learning process occurs. Thus collaborative learning occurs when children and adults in communities switch between "knowledge performers" and "observing helpers".&lt;ref name="Paradise"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paradise | first1 = R. | last2 = De Haan | first2 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Responsibility and reciprocity: social organization of Mazahua learning practices | url = | journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 187–204 | doi=10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when parents in an indigenous [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] community where assigned the task of organizing children to build a roof over a market stand in such a way that they would learn to do it themselves, parents and children both collaborated on a horizontal structure. Switching between knowledge performer and observing helper, adults and children completed the task peacefully, without assigned roles of educator/student and illustrated that children still took initiative even when adults were still performing.&lt;ref name="Paradise"  /&gt;

Adults and children in indigenous communities of the Americas participate in a horizontal organizational structure; therefore when they work together with one another they are reciprocals of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B. | last2 = Paradise | first2 = R. | last3 = Arauz | first3 = R. M. | last4 = Correa-Chavez | first4 = M. | last5 = Angelillo | first5 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Firsthand learning through intent participation | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 1| pages = 175–203 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118 | pmid=12499516}}&lt;/ref&gt; This horizontal structure allows for flexible leadership, which is one of the key aspects of collaborative learning. The indigenous communities of the Americas are unique in their collaborative learning because they do not discriminate upon age, instead Indigenous communities of the Americas encourage active participation and flexible leadership roles, regardless of age. Children and adults regularly interchange their roles within their community. In addition, Indigenous communities consider [[Observational learning#Observational learning across cultures|observation]] to be a part of the collaborative learning process.&lt;ref name="Paradise"  /&gt;

Collaborative learning can also be incorporated into university settings. For example, the Intercultural Maya University of [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]], has a system that incorporates elders, such as grandparents to act as tutors and as a resource for students to discuss information and knowledge regarding their own language and culture.  The elders give their recommendation at the end of a semester in the decision of passing or failing a student, based on his/her behavior in the community and how well he/she is learning [[Mayan languages|Maya]]. The system is called IKNAL, a mayan word that implies companionship in the learning and doing process that involves several members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Rosado-May, F.  J. (2012).

=== Examples from around the world ===
Collaborative learning varies across the world. The traditional model for learning is instructor based but that model is quickly changing on a global standpoint as countries fight to be at the top of the economy. A country's history, culture, religious beliefs and politics are all aspects of their national identity and these characteristics influence on citizen's view of collaboration in both a classroom and workplace setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Learning Around the World|last = Chylinski|first = Manya|date = 2011|journal = Faculty Matters- Phoenix University|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* '''Collaborative learning development''' Enables developers of learning systems to work as a network. Specifically relevant to e-learning where developers can share and build knowledge into courses in a collaborative environment. Knowledge of a single subject can be pulled together from remote locations using software systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* Collaborative learning in [[thesis circle]]s in higher education is another example of people learning together. In a thesis circle, a number of students work together with at least one professor or lecturer, to collaboratively coach and supervise individual work on final (e.g. undergraduate or MSc) projects. Students switch frequently between their role as co-supervisor of other students and their own thesis work (incl. receiving feedback from other students).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* Collaborative learning in a composition classroom can unite students when assigned open-tasks. [[Kenneth Bruffee]] introduced the learning method, Classroom Consensus Group, in which the instructor allocates groups of three to five (three being ideal) students and assigns a problem to be solved or question to be answered.  There are two directions the nonfoundational task can be presented: as an indistinct, no right answer that generates discussion or propose an answer and request questions and a process of how the answer came to be.  Once the task is assigned, the instructor backs off in order to resist the urge to intervene in students' conversation.  The goal is to remove focus of the instructor's authority.  The instructor must keep time to ensure the students are centered on analogizing, generalizing, and bridging their comprehension with others.  Following group discussion, the instructor is to evaluate, not judge, the students' work.  Ideas should be presented to the entire class thus allowing the small groups to come together as a whole. It is then that the answers can be compared, gaps can be filled, and authority is not on one individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruffee|first=Kenneth|title=Collaborative Learning|year=1993|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=28–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collaborative scripts structure collaborative learning by creating roles and mediating interactions while allowing for flexibility in dialogue and activities.&lt;ref name="Dillen2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dillenbourg | first1 = P. | last2 = Tchounikine | first2 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Flexibility in Macro-Scripts for Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning | url = | journal = Journal of Computer Assisted Learning | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 1–13 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2729.2007.00191.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kollar"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kollar | first1 = I. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = F. | last3 = Hesse | first3 = F. | year = 2006 | title = Collaboration Scripts--A Conceptual Analysis | url = | journal = [[Educational Psychology Review]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 159–185 | doi=10.1007/s10648-006-9007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative scripts are used in nearly all cases of collaborative learning some of which are more suited for face-to-face collaborative learning—usually, more flexible—and others for computer-supported collaborative learning—typically, more constraining.&lt;ref name="Dillen2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kollar"/&gt; Additionally, there are two broad types of scripts: macro-scripts and micro-scripts. Macro-scripts aim at creating situations within which desired interactions will occur. Micro-scripts emphasize activities of individual learners.&lt;ref name="Dillen2007"/&gt;
Collaborative learning is also employed in the business and government sectors. For example, within the [[federal government of the United States]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) is employing a [[collaborative project management]] approach that focuses on [[collaborating, learning and adapting]] (CLA). CLA involves three concepts:&lt;ref&gt;The CLA approach is detailed for USAID staff in the recently revised ADS 201 guidance that details the project management: USAID.

[[File:Garfield Goose 1953 book at home in castle.jpg|thumb|250px|Filled-in child's coloring book, ''Garfield Goose'' (1953)]]

A '''coloring book''' (or '''colouring book''', or '''colouring page''') is a type of book containing [[line art]] to which people are intended to add color using [[crayon]]s, [[Pencil|colored pencil]]s, [[marker pen]]s, [[paint]] or other artistic media. Traditional coloring books and coloring pages are printed on paper or card. Some coloring books have [[Perforation|perforated edge]]s so their pages can be removed from the books and used as individual sheets. Others may include a [[Narrative|story]] line and so are intended to be left intact. Today many children's coloring books feature popular [[character (arts)|cartoon character]]s. They are often used as promotional materials for animated motion pictures. Coloring books may also incorporate other activities such as [[connect the dots]], [[maze]]s and other [[puzzle]]s. Some also incorporate the use of [[stickers]].

==History==
[[Image:The Little Folks Paint Book.jpg|thumb|150px|''The Little Folks Painting Book'', 1879]]
Paint books and coloring books emerged in the United States as part of the "democratization of art" process, inspired by a series of lectures by British artist [[Joshua Reynolds]], and the works of Swiss educator [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and his student [[Friedrich Fröbel]]. Many educators concluded that all, regardless of background, students stood to benefit from [[art education]] as a means of enhancing their conceptual understanding of the tangible, developing their cognitive abilities, and improving skills that would be useful in finding a profession, as well as for the children's spiritual edification.&lt;ref name="Absolutearts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2003/08/04/31263.html|title=Drawn to Art: Art Education and the American Experience, 1800–1950|year=2003|publisher=absolutearts.com|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McLoughlin Brothers]] are credited as the inventors of the coloring book, when, in the 1880s, they produced ''The Little Folks' Painting Book'', in collaboration with [[Kate Greenaway]]. They continued to publish coloring books until the 1920s, when the McLoughlin Brothers became part of the [[Milton Bradley Company]].

Another pioneer in the genre was [[Richard F. Outcault]]. He authored ''Buster's Paint Book'' in 1907, featuring the character of [[Buster Brown]], which he had invented in 1902. It was published by the Stokes Company. This launched a trend to use coloring books to advertise a wide variety of products, including coffee and pianos.&lt;ref name="Absolutearts" /&gt; Until the 1930s, books were designed with the intent for them to be painted instead of colored. Even when [[crayon]]s came into wide use in the 1930s, books were still designed so that they could be painted or colored.&lt;ref name="PatJacobs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loti.com/then_now/Coloring_Books.htm|last=Jacobs|first=Pat|title=Coloring Books|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloring books are widely used in schooling for young children for various reasons.  For example, children are often more interested in coloring books rather than using other learning methods; pictures may also be more memorable than simply words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringpagesonline.net/coloring-pages-online-a-helping-hand-for-parents-and-teachers/|title=A Helping Hand for Parents and Teachers|date=February 5, 2012|publisher=Coloring Pages Online|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring may also increase creativity in painting, according to some research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colorkid.net/benefits_of_coloring research]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a predominantly non-verbal medium, coloring books have also seen wide applications in education where a target group does not speak and understand the primary language of instruction or communication. Examples of this include the use of coloring books in [[Guatemala]] to teach children about hieroglyphs and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] artist patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Perspectives of Children's Literature in Guatemala | jstor=344988 | journal=Hispania | first=Sue | last=Misheff |date=September 1994 | volume=77 | issue=3 | pages=524–531 | doi=10.2307/344988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production of coloring books to educate the children of farm workers about "the pathway by which agricultural pesticides are transferred from work to home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1289/ehp.5203 | title=Nuclear Waste Transportation: Case Studies of Identifying Stakeholder Risk Information Needs |date=March 2003 | journal=Environmental Health Perspectives | volume=111 | issue=3 | pages=263–272 | last=Drew | first=Christina H. |author2=Deirdre A.

Faustman  | pmid=12611653 | pmc=1241381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring books are also said to help to motivate students' understanding of concepts that they would otherwise be uninterested in.

They have been used as teaching aids for developing creativity and knowledge of geometry, such as in [[Roger Burrows]]' ''Altair Designs''.

Since the 1980s, several publishers have produced educational coloring books intended for studying graduate-level topics such as anatomy and physiology, where color-coding of many detailed diagrams are used as a learning aid. Examples include ''The Anatomy Coloring Book'' and subsequent book series, by Wynn Kapit and Lawrence Elson, published by [[HarperCollins]] (1990s) and [[Benjamin Cummings]] (2000s).&lt;ref&gt;''The Anatomy Coloring Book'', Wynn Kapit and Lawrence M. Elson. HarperCollins, 1993, second revised and expanded edition, {{ISBN|0-06-455016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some examples of educators using coloring books to better explain complicated topics, like math&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Vn3GLf-4YkEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=coloring+book&amp;ots=mWvrVhWoy2&amp;sig=MVSjMedFtE-tFSCApYpacxV-AYE#v=onepage&amp;q=coloring%20book&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045794979900622]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publishers have specialized in coloring books with an explicit educational purpose, both for children and for adults. The books often have extensive text accompanying each image. These publishers include [[Dover Books]], [[Really Big Coloring Books]], [[Running Press]], and [[Malcolm Whyte|Troubador Press]].

==Health and therapeutic uses==
Coloring books have seen wide application in the health professions as educational tools. One nurse, trying to limit the trauma of surgery, described in an academic publication how the use of a coloring book "might help [the child] to understand what was going to happen to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Tonsil Season | first=Carolyn | jstor=3451768 | last=Harris | journal=The American Journal of Nursing | volume=61 | issue=1 |date=January 1961 | pages=91–92 | doi=10.2307/3451768}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in rehabilitation of accident victims to aid recovery of [[hand–eye coordination]], and they are used with [[Autism|autistic]] children both for entertainment and for their soothing effect. Coloring books have been used to explain complicated medical conditions to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R. |last1=McDonald |first2=A. |last2=Thomsen |first3=Y. |last3=Belessis |first4=A. |last4=Jaffe |date=June 2007 |title=292 CF and Me – a colouring book for children |journal=Journal of Cystic Fibrosis |volume=6 |issue=Suppl 1 |page=S71 |doi=10.1016/S1569-1993(07)60267-7 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199307602677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals of adult coloring books is that they help users relax and de-stress.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colouring books designed for adults topping bestseller lists (Books by illustrator Johanna Basford (Secret Garden and Enchanted Forest) created as a way to de-stress) |date= April 6, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2015|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/04/06/colouring-books-designed-for-adults-topping-bestseller-lists.html|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political uses==
In 1962, cartoonist [[Mort Drucker]] teamed with humorist [[Paul Laikin]] in creating the ''[[John F. Kennedy]] Coloring Book'', a satirical introduction to Kennedy, his family and administration, told from the point of view of his daughter [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]]. The book sold 2,500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

In 1968 the ''Black Panther Coloring Book'' began circulating in the United States; the book features black men and children killing [[List of slang terms for police officers#P|pigs dressed as police officers]].  It was argued to have been made not by the [[Black Panther Party]] but by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[COINTELPRO]] program to discredit the organization, a claim which other sources dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Some commentators have alleged that the book was a piece of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[agitprop]].

The term and concept of the "coloring book" was adopted by the [[feminism|feminist]] artist [[Tee Corinne]] as a tool of female empowerment. Corinne made pencil sketches of female genitalia, which she then inked and printed on card stock. She published a collection of them in 1975 as ''The Cunt Coloring Book.''
{{quote|No other name seemed really to fit, although the word "cunt" was not one with which I was particularly comfortable. The alliteration, though, was nice.

In August 2011, American publisher Really Big Coloring Books released ''We Shall Never Forget: The Kids Book of Freedom'' detailing specific drawings in the accounting of [[SEAL Team 6]] shooting [[Osama bin Laden]] in his home. The book was criticized by some for portraying Muslims in a negative manner.

==Fine art==
Photographer Jno Cook produced line drawings based on [[Robert Frank]]'s ''[[The Americans (photography)|The Americans]]'', and in 1983 published them in a limited edition as ''The Robert Frank Coloring Book''. In 1994, the [[National Gallery of Art]] used the images as [[party favor]]s for writers working on the catalog for a retrospective of Frank's work.&lt;ref name="jnocook"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Jno|title=The Robert Frank Coloring Book|url=http://jnocook.net/frank/rfcolor1.htm|website=jnocook.net|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloring books are a form of adult [[therapy]] that have seen a growth in popularity in the 2010s. They reportedly bring people a sense of their [[childhood]],&lt;ref name="MedicalDaily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dovey|first1=Dana|title=The Therapeutic Science Of Adult Coloring Books: How This Childhood Pastime Helps Adults Relieve Stress|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/therapeutic-science-adult-coloring-books-how-childhood-pastime-helps-adults-356280|accessdate=13 April 2016|publisher=Medical Daily|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and help with developing fine motor skills and vision, reducing anxiety and creating focus, and relieving stress and anxiety in a manner similar to [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/health/adult-coloring-books-popularity-mental-health/index.html|title=Why adult coloring books are good for you|website=CNN|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrating on coloring may facilitate the replacement of negative thoughts and images with pleasant ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/therapeutic-science-adult-coloring-books-how-childhood-pastime-helps-adults-356280|title=The Therapeutic Science Of Adult Coloring Books|website=Medical Daily|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring books can be used in daily activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Paper notebook with adult coloring pages|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books are also a way to get away from technology, which some regard as beneficial to people's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bratskeir|first1=Kate|title=Unplug From Technology: 19 Ways To Spend Time Off The Grid|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/unplug-from-technology_n_2762116.html|accessdate=13 April 2016 |publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com |date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used by people who are uncomfortable with more creatively expressive forms of art.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

While coloring books for adults were popular in the early 1960s, those were satirical works rather than the therapeutic works that define the adult coloring book form today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/126580/radical-history-1960s-adult-coloring-books|title=The Radical History of 1960s Adult Coloring Books|publisher=''The New Republic''|date=December 28, 2015|first=Laura|last=Marsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful adult coloring books were published in 2012 and 2013,&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; and began increasing in popularity in 2015.

By 2016, [[Faber-Castell]], a worldwide color pencil supplier, was reported to have trouble keeping up with demand for their products due to the craze,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryall|first1=Jenni|title=All the adults colouring is leading to huge sales for pencil companies|url=http://mashable.com/2016/04/10/colouring-trend/#OD9Gr_TPMgqb|website=Mashable|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Blue Star Coloring]] sold over a million titles in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/02/10/books-how-adult-coloring-books-became-popular|title=How adult coloring books became a million-dollar trend|work=MPR News|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Author [[Susan Jacoby]] has criticized adult coloring books, along with the popularity among adults of [[young adult fiction]], as "an artifact of a broader cultural shift. And that cultural shift is a bad thing.”&lt;ref name="newyorkerraphael"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raphael|first1=Adrienne|title=Why Adults Are Buying Coloring Books (for Themselves)|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-adults-are-buying-coloring-books-for-themselves|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes the [[Great Recession]] has contributed to this shift, as adults unable to find employment have moved home to live with their parents. New York City [[futurist]] and blogger Dominic Bulsuto describes adult coloring book fans as "stuck in The Shallows, mindfully coloring books to counter the existential angst of living in a digital society." He goes on to say that "...the endless Internet parade of silly cat photos, infantile comments and adolescent [[Internet meme|meme]]s has dumbed us down." However, Bulsuto ultimately sees the trend as a good thing, noting that adults are increasingly buying books they want to buy, rather than books they are supposed to buy.&lt;ref name=Coloringpost/&gt;

==Coloring book software==
Coloring books can also be found digitally in the form of coloring book websites and applications. Coloring book software often has features such as color mixing, [[Flood Fill|flood filling]], and paintbrush tools that allow for more accurate and detailed drawings than regular coloring books.

'''Compliance training''' refers to the process of educating employees on laws, regulations and company policies that apply to their day-to-day job responsibilities. An organization that engages in compliance training typically hopes to accomplish several goals: (1) avoiding and detecting violations by employees that could lead to legal liability for the organization; (2) creating a more hospitable and respectful workplace; (3) laying the groundwork for a partial or complete defense in the event that employee wrongdoing occurs despite the organization's training efforts; and (4) adding business value and a competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Business Case For Safety|url=https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/success_stories/compliance_assistance/abbott/abbott_casestudies/slide3.html|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations offer their employees compliance training on a wide range of topics, including workplace discrimination and harassment, dealings with competitors, [[insider trading]], protecting [[trade secret]]s, [[records management]], bribery and kickbacks, etc. Typically, most or all of these compliance topics are addressed in an organization's [[Code of Conduct]], and the organization may offer employees annual or bi-annual Code of Conduct training in lieu of requiring employees to take multiple individual training programs.

== History ==

"The history of how compliance regulations and mandates came about is not linear and completely clear, however most refer that it began around the Reagan scandals during his presidency. Moving ahead from that, it was the early 1990's after the Federal Sentencing Guidelines promised reduced fines for implementing an Effective Compliance and Ethics Program (ECEP). The last phase came from a number of high profile corporate corruption cases that include companies such as Enron, MCI/WorldCom, and Tyco."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thetruthaboutbusiness.blogspot.com/2010/10/history-and-emergence-of-ethics-and.html|title=History and Emergence of Ethics and Compliance|last=Joe|website=The Truth About Business|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Who is required to have compliance training? ==

Companies in all business sectors are under pressure to demonstrate that their employees are trained in laws and regulations, and internal policies, that pertain to their roles. Most notably, companies in the financial and healthcare sectors - who face stringent regulations - and publicly regulated companies have taken the lead by instituting firm-wide compliance training programs. For example, [[Walmart|WalMart]] would be required to train their employees on sexual harassment, data security, anti-harassment, and more.

For financial institutions, the key compliance training topics are [[Money laundering|anti money laundering]], [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]], and [[Insider trading|insider dealing]] ([[market abuse]] in the EU).

== Process ==

Compliance training can be performed in-house by compliance training specialists, or hired out to consultant firms. Some compliance training is done online.

=== Penalties for non-compliance ===
While this is entirely tied to the realm of compliance that is being considered, the penalties can range from a Fine, through the seizure of company assets, to jail time for executives of the company at fault. For example, the consequences of not being compliant with Anti Money Laundering cost the Las Vegas Sands Resort to pay $47 Million in penalties for suspicious credit card transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.markspaneth.com/insights/service/service/consequences-of-having-a-poor-anti-money-laundering-program|title=Consequences of Having a Poor Anti-Money Laundering Program - Marks Paneth|website=www.markspaneth.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIPAA fines for lack of compliance can be staggering as well. In the past, the Alaska State Department paid $1,700,000 in fines for an Unencrypted USB hard drive stolen, poor policies and risk analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.truevault.com/blog/what-is-the-penalty-for-a-hipaa-violation.html|title=What is the penalty for a HIPAA violation? - TrueVault|website=www.truevault.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical thinking''' is the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] analysis of [[fact]]s to form a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=The International Center for the Assessment of Higher Order Thinking (ICAT, US)/Critical Thinking Community|accessdate=2017-03-22|author=Edward M. Glaser}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is complex, and several different [[Critical thinking#Definitions|definitions]] exist, which generally include the [[rational]], [[skepticism|skeptical]], [[unbiased]] analysis, or evaluation of factual [[evidence]]. Critical thinking is [[Self-directedness|self-directed]], [[Discipline|self-disciplined]], self-[[Monitoring (medicine)|monitored]], and self-[[Corrective feedback|corrective]] thinking. It presupposed assent to rigorous standards of [[excellence]] and mindful command to their use. It entails effective communication and problem-solving abilities, as well as a commitment to overcome our native [[egocentrism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telacommunications.com/nutshell/stages.htm|title=Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development|website=www.telacommunications.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201204/it-s-fine-line-between-narcissism-and-egocentrism|title=It’s a Fine Line Between Narcissism and Egocentrism|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociocentrism|sociocentrism.]]

==History==
The earliest documentation of critical thinking are the teachings of [[Socrates]] recorded by Plato. Socrates established the fact that one cannot depend upon those in "authority" to have sound knowledge and insight. He demonstrated that persons may have power and high position and yet be deeply confused and irrational. He established the importance of asking deep questions that probe profoundly into thinking before we accept ideas as worthy of belief.

He established the importance of seeking evidence, closely examining reasoning and assumptions, analyzing basic concepts, and tracing out implications not only of what is said but of what is done as well. His method of questioning is now known as "Socratic Questioning" and is the best known critical thinking teaching strategy. In his mode of questioning, Socrates highlighted the need for thinking for clarity and logical consistency. Socrates asked people questions to reveal their irrational thinking or lack of reliable knowledge. Socrates demonstrated that having authority does not ensure accurate knowledge. He established the method of questioning beliefs, closely inspecting assumptions and relying on evidence and sound rationale. Plato recorded Socrates' teachings and carried on the tradition of critical thinking. Aristotle and subsequent Greek skeptics refined Socrates' teachings, using systematic thinking and asking questions to ascertain the true nature of reality beyond the way things appear from a glance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/a-brief-history-of-the-idea-of-critical-thinking/408|title=A Brief History of the Idea of Critical Thinking|website=www.criticalthinking.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates set the agenda for the tradition of critical thinking, namely, to reflectively question common beliefs and explanations, carefully distinguishing beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that—however appealing to our native egocentrism, however much they serve our vested interests, however comfortable or comforting they may be—lack adequate evidence or rational foundation to warrant belief.

Critical thinking was described by Richard W. Paul as a movement in two waves (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=181–98|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "first wave" of critical thinking is often referred to as 
a 'critical analysis' that is clear, [[rationality|rational]] thinking involving [[critique]]. Its details vary amongst those who [[operational definition|define]] it. According to Barry K. Beyer (1995), critical thinking means making clear, reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking, ideas should be reasoned, well thought out, and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/critproj/overview.html|title = The Critical Thinking Movement: Alternating Currents in One Teacher's Thinking|first=James R. | last=Elkins|accessdate = 23 March 2014 |website =myweb.wvnet.edu |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org//|title=Critical Thinking Index Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines critical thinking as the "&lt;nowiki&gt;intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&lt;/nowiki&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

]]
In the term '''critical thinking''', the word ''[[wikt:critical|critical]]'', (Grk. κριτικός = ''kritikos'' = "critic") derives from the word '''critic''' and implies a [[critique]]; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means "of judging", "of judgement", "for judging", and of being "able to discern".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lesley. (ed.) ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993) p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual roots of critical&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dictionary.com/e/critical-thinking/|title=Lexical Investigations: Critical Thinking - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2013-06-25|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking are as [[Ancient history|''ancient'']] as its etymology, traceable, ultimately, to the [[Teachings and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda|teaching]] practice and vision of '''''[[Socrates]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/socrates-9488126|title=Socrates|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,500 years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to [[Knowledge|knowledge.]]

* Thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking. Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than 'improving' one's own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the [[rationality]] of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Kirby; letter to Olivetti, Laguna Salada Union School District, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/critical+analysis|title=critical analysis|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities, concepts, and processes such as creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting knowing, feminist theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and inconclusiveness.  Some definitions of critical thinking exclude these subjective practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic and rationality==
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016|reason=need to follow standard wikipedia reference style}}
The ability to reason logically is a fundamental skill of rational agents, hence the study of the form of correct argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking.

"First wave" logical [[thinking]] consisted of understanding the connections between two concepts or points in thought. It followed a philosophy where the [[Thought|thinker]] was removed from the train of thought and the connections and the analysis of the connect was devoid of any bias of the thinker. Kerry Walters describes this ideology in his essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking, "A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective. This model of [[thinking]] has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt; The adoption of these principals parallels themselves with the increasing reliance on a quantitative understanding of the world.

In the ‘second wave’ of critical thinking, as defined by [[Kerry S. Walters]] (Re-thinking Reason, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;1), many authors moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking that the ‘first wave’ privileged, especially in institutions of higher [[learning]]. Walters summarizes logicism as "the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective."&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;
As the ‘second wave’ took hold, scholars began to take a more inclusive view of what constituted as critical thinking. Rationality and logic are still widely accepted in many circles as the primary examples of critical thinking.

===Deduction, abduction and induction===
{{main|logical reasoning}}
There are three types of [[logical reasoning]] Informally, two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]: [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]].
* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] is the conclusion of a consequence given premises that logically follow by [[modus ponens]].
  e.g., X is human and all humans have a face so X has a face.
* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies.
  e.g., The sum of even integers is even.
  2x+2y = 2(x+y); The sum of integers is an integer and x and y are integers, so 2x+2y=2z where z is an integer, thus 2z is an even integer, so the sum of even integers is even.
* [[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]] is drawing a conclusion using a [[heuristic]] that is likely, but not inevitable given some foreknowledge.
  e.g., I observe sheep in a field, and they appear white from my viewing angle, so sheep are white.
       Contrast with the deductive statement:"Some sheep are white on at least one side."
&lt;!--Start copypasta--&gt;

===Critical thinking and rationality===
Kerry S. Walters (Re-thinking Reason, 1994) argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the "calculus of justification" but also considers "[[cognitive]] acts such as [[imagination]], conceptual creativity, [[intuition]] and insight" (p.&amp;nbsp;63). These "functions" are focused on discovery, on more abstract processes instead of linear, rules-based approaches to problem-solving. The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the [[rational]] [[mind]].&lt;ref name="Walters1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerry S. Walters|title=Re-Thinking Reason: New Perspectives in Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfT32n2Hvd0C|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to critically analyze an argument – to dissect structure and components, thesis and reasons – is essential. But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives. These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking to be a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry.&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

==Functions==
The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and [[metacognition]]. According to Reynolds (2011), an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Martin (2011). Critical thinking and systems thinking: towards a critical literacy for systems thinking in practice. In: Horvath, Christopher P. and Forte, James M. eds. Critical Thinking. New York: Nova Science Publishers, pp. 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence through reality
* Context skills to isolate the problem from context
* Relevant criteria for making the judgment well
* Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment
* Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand

In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills, one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only [[logic]] but broad [[intellect]]ual criteria such as clarity, [[credibility]], [[accuracy]], precision, [[relevance]], depth, [[breadth]], significance, and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first= Elizabeth A., &amp; And Others |year=1995|title= National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identifying College Graduates' Essential Skills in Writing, Speech and Listening, and Critical Thinking.

==Procedure==
Critical thinking calls for the ability to:
* Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
* Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem solving
* Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
* Recognize [[unstated assumption]]s and values
* Comprehend and use [[language]] with accuracy, clarity, and [[wikt:discernment|discernment]]
* Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
* Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
* Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
* Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
* Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
* Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In sum:

"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends."&lt;ref name=glaser&gt;{{Cite book| title=An Experiment in the Development of Critical Thinking| edition=| author=Edward M. Glaser| year=1941| publisher=New York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University| isbn=0-404-55843-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habits or traits of mind==
The habits of [[mind]] that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead, a systematic approach to problem solving, [[inquisitiveness]], even-handedness, and confidence in [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identification of the Skills to be Taught, Learned, and Assessed, NCES 94–286, US Dept of Education, Addison Greenwood (Ed), Sal Carrallo (PI). See also, Critical thinking: A statement of expert consensus for purposes of educational assessment and instruction. ERIC Document No. ED 315–423&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a definition analysis by Kompf &amp; Bond (2001), critical thinking involves problem solving, decision making, [[metacognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html|title=Teaching Metacognition|website=Metacognition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; rationality, rational thinking, [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[intelligence]] and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development, possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.

==Research==
Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:&lt;ref name=glaser/&gt;

#An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
#Knowledge of the methods of logical [[inquiry]] and reasoning
#Some skill in applying those methods.
Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners, individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts, continue to address these same three central elements.

The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab, [[London]], is involved in scientific study of all major [[educational system]] in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/research/| title=Research at Human Science Lab |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S.A. (2002) "Two Systems of Reasoning," in ''Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment'', Govitch, Griffin, Kahneman (Eds), Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79679-8}}; ''Thinking and Reasoning in Human Decision Making: The Method of Argument and Heuristic Analysis'', Facione and Facione, 2007, California Academic Press.  {{ISBN|978-1-891557-58-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question. Some people have both in abundance, some have skills but not the disposition to use them, some are disposed but lack strong skills, and some have neither. A measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OT12dZ0binIC&amp;pg=PA46 ''Research on Sociocultural Influences on Motivation and Learning''], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Catherine, M.|date=2007|title=California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory: Further Factor Analytic Examination|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151|journal=SAGE|volume=104|pages=141–151|via=SAGE|doi=10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CriTT is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinking&lt;ref&gt;Stupple, E.

Development of the Critical Thinking Toolkit (CriTT): A measure of student attitudes and beliefs about critical thinking. Thinking Skills and Creativity, 23, 91-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[John Dewey]] is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and the entire democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1910). ''How we think.'' Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is significant in academics due to being significant in learning. Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of [[internalization]], in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content.  And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application, whereby those ideas, principles, and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives.

Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles. The core concepts are always there, but they are embedded in subject-specific content. For students to learn content, intellectual engagement is crucial. All students must do their own thinking, their own construction of knowledge. Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions, readings, activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.

Historically, teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However, a second wave of critical thinking, urges educators to value conventional techniques, meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In 1994, Kerry Walters&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Kerry. (1994). ''Re-Thinking Reason''. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors’ research regarding connected knowing, empathy, gender-sensitive ideals, collaboration, world views, intellectual autonomy, morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking.

In the English and Welsh school systems, ''Critical Thinking'' is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]. Under the [[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]], students can sit two exam papers for the AS: "Credibility of Evidence" and "Assessing and Developing Argument". The full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is now available: in addition to the two AS units, candidates sit the two papers "Resolution of Dilemmas" and "Critical Reasoning". The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about, and analyze, arguments on their deductive or inductive validity, as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However, due to its comparative lack of subject content, many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html Critical Thinking FAQs from Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411150135/http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html |date=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills, and the full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is useful for degree courses in politics, philosophy, history or [[theology]], providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful, for example, in biblical study.

There used to also be an [[Advanced Extension Award]] offered in Critical Thinking in the UK, open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. [[Cambridge International Examinations]] have an A-level in Thinking Skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel/subject/aleveldetails?assdef_id=765_804|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level subjects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php "New GCEs for 2008"], Assessment and Qualifications Alliance {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217221100/http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]] have also modified theirs for 2008. Many examinations for university entrance set by universities, on top of A-level examinations, also include a critical thinking component, such as the [[LNAT]], the [[UKCAT]], the [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] and the [[Thinking Skills Assessment]].

In [[Qatar]], critical thinking was offered by [[AL-Bairaq]]—an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind [[AL-Bairaq]] is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=

===Efficacy===
In 1995, a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher [[education]] was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Gardiner, Redesigning Higher Education: Producing Dramatic Gains in Student Learning, in conjunction with: ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
The study noted concerns from higher [[education]], [[politician]]s, and [[business]] that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens.  It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' [[thinking]] skills, in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of [[cognition]], rather than developing intellect or [[values]].

In a more recent meta-analysis, researchers reviewed 341 quasi- or true-experimental studies, all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"&gt;Abrami, P. C., Bernard, R. M., Borokhovski, E., Waddington, D. I., Wade, C. A., &amp; Persson, T. (2014). Strategies for Teaching Students to Think Critically: A Meta-Analysis. Review of Educational Research, 1–40&lt;/ref&gt; The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools, which include standardized tests (and second-source measures), tests developed by teachers, tests developed by researchers, and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the [[researcher]].  The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance in encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment.  Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of [[educational]] settings.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"/&gt; One attempt to assess the [[humanities]]' role in teaching critical thinking and reducing belief in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims was made at [[North Carolina State University]]. Some success was noted and the researchers emphasized the value of the humanities in providing the skills to evaluate current events and qualitative data in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink1=Kendrick Frazier |title=Humanities, Too: In New Study, History Courses in Critical Thinking Reduce Pseudoscientific Beliefs |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lilienfeld]] notes that there is some evidence to suggest that basic critical thinking skills might be successfully taught to children at a younger age than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |title=Teaching Skepticism: How Early Can We Begin? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810182835/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2018-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in academia==
Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines (by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.). Within the framework of [[scientific skepticism]], the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a [[theory of justification|well-justified]] conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms, therefore, a system of related, and overlapping, modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, historical thinking, political thinking, [[psychological]] thinking, philosophical thinking, mathematical thinking, chemical thinking, biological thinking, ecological thinking, legal thinking, ethical thinking, musical thinking, thinking like a painter, sculptor, engineer, business person, etc. In other words, though critical thinking principles are universal, their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective [[contextualism|contextualization]].

Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields because it enables one to analyze, evaluate, explain, and restructure their thinking, thereby decreasing the risk of adopting, acting on, or thinking with, a false belief. However, even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, mistakes can happen due to a thinker's inability to apply the methods or because of character traits such as [[egocentrism]]. Critical thinking includes identification of [[prejudice]], [[bias]], propaganda, self-deception, distortion, [[misinformation]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/fallacy/biases.php |title=[F08] Cognitive biases |last1=Lau |first1=Joe |last2=Chan |first2=Jonathan |date= |website=Critical thinking web |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given research in [[cognitive psychology]], some [[education|educators]] believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking [[skill]]s and cultivation of intellectual traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-moral-integrity-and-citizenship-teaching-for-the-intellectual-virtues/487 |title=Critical Thinking, Moral Integrity and Citizenship |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Criticalthinking.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking, nurses can question, evaluate, and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve, reflect, and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates "new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Catching the wave: understanding the concept of critical thinking (1999) {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.00925.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sociocultural, environmental, and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery, it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies (2006).&lt;ref&gt;College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for 
[http://www.cno.org/Global/4-LearnAboutStandardsAndGuidelines/prac/learn/modules/profstands/slides/Competence.pdf Continuing Competencies (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;
It requires nurses to engage in [[Reflective Practice]] and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College.

Critical thinking is also considered important for [[human rights education]] for [[toleration]]. The [[International Day for Tolerance|Declaration of Principles on Tolerance]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 affirms that "education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others, and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, ''critical thinking'' and ethical [[reasoning]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=UNESCO |title=International Day for Tolerance . Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, Article 4, 3 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13175&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is used as a way of deciding whether a claim is true, partially true, or false. It is a tool by which one can come about reasoned conclusions based on a reasoned process.

==In computer-mediated communication==
The advent and rising popularity of online courses has prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication (CMC) promotes, hinders, or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course (relative to face-to-face communication). There is some evidence to suggest a fourth, more nuanced possibility: that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others. For example, Guiller et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Guiller2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guiller|first1=Jane|last2=Durndell|first2=Alan|last3=Ross|first3=Anne|title=Peer interaction and critical thinking: Face-to-face or online discussion?|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=2008|volume=18|pages=187–200|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, relative to face-to-face discourse, online discourse featured more justifications, while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said. The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions, while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of ‘real time’ discussion. Newman et al. (1995)&lt;ref name="Newman1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=D R|last2=Webb|first2=Brian|last3=Cochrane|first3=Clive|title=A content analysis method to measure critical thinking in face-to-face and computer supported group learning|journal=Interpersonal Computing and Technology|date=1995|volume=3|issue=September 1993|pages=56–77|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x|pmid=18352969}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed similar differential effects. They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas, it lacked novelty. The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment. Rather, the asynchrony may promote users to put forth “considered, thought out contributions.”

Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis,&lt;ref name="Newman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiller2008" /&gt; where the text of online discourse (or the transcription of face-to-face discourse) is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking. For example, a statement might be coded as “Discuss ambiguities to clear them up” or “Welcoming outside knowledge” as positive indicators of critical thinking. Conversely, statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as “Sticking to prejudice or assumptions” or “Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge.” The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking.

Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn (1991),&lt;ref name="Kuhn1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|title=The skills of argument|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction. There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development, but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor. For example, research has shown that 3- to 4-year-old children can discern, to some extent, the differential creditability&lt;ref name="Koenig2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=M A|last2=Harris|first2=P L|title=Preschoolers mistrust ignorant and inaccurate speakers|journal=Child Development|date=2005|volume=76|pages=1261–77|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00849.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expertise&lt;ref name="Lutz2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutz|first1=D J|last2=Keil|first2=F C|title=Early understanding of the division of cognitive labor|journal=Child Development|date=2002|volume=73|pages=1073–84|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00458}}&lt;/ref&gt; of individuals. Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States.&lt;ref name="Heyman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyman|first1=G D|last2=Fu|first2=G|last3=Lee|first3=K|title=Evaluating claims peoplemake about themselves: The development of skepticism|journal=Child Development|date=2007|volume=78|pages=367–75|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01003.x|pmc=2570105}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation, it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1680">'''Differential Educational Achievement (DEA)''' is a [[Sociology|sociological]] term often given to a concept that disagrees with some of the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] views on [[education]].

Many functionalists believe that an individual's academic success depends completely upon that person's IQ ([[intelligence quotient]]) and the effort they apply to their studies. They also believe that society works in a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic system]]: that people work for what they achieve, and achieve what they deserve, according to their own merit and effort, i.e., they work hard to get the best jobs in later life.

Some other sociologists do not concur with this idea. They think that other factors have a more prominent impact on one's education. These factors may include [[social class]] background, [[gender]] and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.org.uk/diffed1.doc - “A” Level Sociology] - Teaching Notes for Students ''Education and Training - Differential Educational Achievement''&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Marxists]] believe that this is due to social class, and that in education only the ruling class values are transmitted. This means that working-class people find it difficult to connect with the education system. In this respect, according to this theory, many people from less [[affluent]] backgrounds are academically disadvantaged from the very start.

'''Education 2030 Agenda''' refers to the global commitment of the [[Education For All|Education for All]] movement to ensure access to basic education for all.  It is an essential part of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The roadmap to achieve the Agenda is the Education 2030 [[Incheon declaration|Incheon Declaration]] and Framework for Action, which outlines how countries, working with [[UNESCO]] and global partners, can translate commitments into action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002472/247234e.pdf|title=Education Transforms Lives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=6, 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education 2030 Agenda stretches from early childhood learning to youth and adult education and training; Emphasizes the acquisition of skills for work; Underlines the importance of citizenship education; Focuses on inclusion, equity and gender equality; And aims to ensure quality learning outcomes for all, throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the main responsibility for implementing the agenda lies with governments, UNESCO and partners provide support through coordinated policy advice, technical assistance, capacity development and monitoring of progress at global, regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ten targets to achieve the Education 2030 Agenda ==
The 10 targets of [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] 4 encompass many different aspects of education. Seven targets are of expected outcomes and three are means of achieving these targets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.1 Universal primary and secondary education:''' By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.2 Early childhood development and universal pre-primary education:''' By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.3 Equal access to technical/vocational and higher education:''' By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to an ordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.4 Relevant skills for decent work:''' By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|technical and vocational skills]], for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.5 Gender equality and inclusion:''' By 2030, eliminate [[Sex differences in education|gender disparities in education]] and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and [[Children in emergencies and conflicts|children in vulnerable situations]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.6 Universal youth and adult literacy:''' By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve [[literacy]] and numeracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.7 Education for sustainable development and global citizenship:''' By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, [[global citizenship]] and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.a Effective learning environments:''' Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.b Scholarships:''' By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''4.c Teachers and educators:''' By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:DibujoPsicologoEducativo3.gif|thumb|320 px|right|Functions of educational psychologist]]

An '''educational psychologist''' is a [[psychologist]] whose differentiating functions may include diagnostic and psycho-educational [[Psychological evaluation|assessment]], [[psychological counseling]] in [[education]]al communities ([[students]], [[teachers]], [[parents]] and academic authorities), community-type psycho-educational intervention, and [[mediation]], coordination, and referral to other professionals, at all levels of the educational system. Many countries use this term to signify those who provide services to students, their teachers, and [[families]] while other countries use this term to signify academic expertise in teaching Educational Psychology.

==Specific facts==
[[Psychology]] is a so well developed discipline that allows different specializations: a) clinical and health psychology, b) work and organizational psychology, c) [[educational psychology]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, R. J. (2006). Educational psychology: The distinctive contribution. ''Educational Psychology in Practice'', 22, 289-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, T. K., &amp; Wise, P. S. (Eds.). (2007).'' School psychology: Past, present and future (3rd ed.)''. Bethesda, MD: National Association of School Psychologists. {{ISBN|978-0-932955-71-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jimerson, S. R., Oakland, T. D., &amp; Farrel, P. T. (Eds.).(2007). ''The handbook of international school psychology.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-2669-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R., &amp; Alexander, P. A. (Eds.) . (2010). ''Handbook of research on learning and instruction''. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-80461-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, W. M., &amp; Miller, G. J. (Eds.).(2003). ''Handbook of psychology. Vol. 7: Educational Psychology.'' New Jersey: Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-38406-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittrock, M. C. (1992). «An empowering conception of educational psychology». ''Educational Psychologist, 27'', 129-141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, B. J., &amp; Schunk, D. H. (Eds.). (2003). ''Educational psychology: A century of contributions''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-3682-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; What differentiates an educational psychologist from other psychologists or specialists is constituted by an academic triangle whose vertexes are represented by three categories: [[teachers]], [[students]] and [[curricula]] (see diagram). The use of plural in these three cases assumes two meanings: a) the traditional or official one and b) other more general derived from our information and knowledge society. The plural also indicates that nowadays we can no longer consider the average student or teacher, or a closed [[curriculum]], but the enormous variety found in our students, teachers and curricula. The triangle vertexes are connected by two-directional arrows, allowing four-fold typologies instead of the traditional two-way relationships (e.g., teacher-student).  In this way, we can find, in different educational contexts, groups of good teachers and students (excellent [[teaching/learning]] processes and products), groups of good teachers but bad students, and groups of bad teachers and good students, producing in both cases lower levels of academic achievements. In addition, we can find groups of bad teachers and bad students (school failure).
This specific work of an educational psychologist takes place in different contexts: micro-, meso- and macro-systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bonfenbrenner, U. (1979). ''The ecology of human development: Experiments by nature and design.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-22457-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsystem (educational psychology)|Microsystem]]s refer to family contexts, where atmosphere, hidden curriculum, and expectations and behaviors of all family members determine, to a large extent, the educational development of each student.  The term [[mesosystem]] refers to all variety of contexts found in educational institutions, knowing that different variables such as geographical location, institution marketing or type of teachers and students, etc., can influence the academic results of students. [[Macrosystem]] has a much more general and global nature, leading us, for example, to consider the influence that the different societies or countries have on educational final products. One illustrative example of this level can be the analyses carried out on data gathered by the [[PISA]] reports. This approach would be the essence of educational psychology versus school psychology for many of U.S. educational researchers and for Division 15 of APA.

==Specific functions==
The most noteworthy function is, without a doubt, formal (rather than informal) assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, M. W., Crosby, E. G., &amp; Pearson, J. L. (2001). Role of the school psychologist: Perceptions of school staff. ''School Psychology International, 22'', 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[evaluation]] involves collecting information, in a valid and reliable way, about the three target groups of the triangle diagram (in their respective contexts): [[teachers]], [[students]] and [[curricula]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, J. (2008).'' Assessment of teaching quality: A circular model of evaluation''. Madrid: Editorial Complutense. {{ISBN|978-84-7491-943-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation is divided in at least two main types: diagnosis (dysfunctions detection such as physical, sensory and intellectual impairments, dyslexia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, pervasive development disorders or autism spectrum disorders) and psycho-educational evaluation (detection of curriculum difficulties, poor school atmosphere or family problems, etc.). [[Evaluation]] implies detection, and, thanks to this, [[Prevention Science|Prevention]].

A second function, very relevant too, is psychological counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Erchul, W. P., &amp; Sheridan, S. M. (Eds.).(2008). Handbook of research in school consultation: Empirical foundation for the field. New York: Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-5336-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This must be directed to: a) [[students]], in their various dimensions (intellectual, obviously, but also their social, affective and professional dimensions); b) [[parents]], as ‘paraprofessionals’ who may implement programs, selected or developed by educational psychologists, to solve their child/student problems; c) teachers, to whom will be offered psycho-educational support to face psychological difficulties that may be found when implementing and adapting [[curricula]] to diversity shown by students; d) academic authorities, who will be helped in their decision-making, regarding the teaching (teaching process) and administrative duties (providing necessary support for students with specific educational needs, decisions about promotion to the next level, and so on).

A third function based on [[communitarian interventions]], with three main facets:  corrective, preventative, and optimizing interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, M. K., Codding, R. S., Boice, C. H., &amp; Lukito, G. (2010). Meta-analysis of acquisition and fluency math interventions with instructional and frustration level skills: Evidence for a skill-by-treatment interaction. ''School Psychology Review'', 39, 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, L. S., &amp; Fuchs, D. (1986). Linking assessment to instructional intervention: An overview. ''School Psychology Review'', 15,318-323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff, J., &amp; Meisels, S. J. (Eds.).(2000). Handbook of early childhood intervention (2nd ed.). New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58573-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. K., &amp; Reese, H. W. (Eds.).(1980). ''Life-span developmental psychology: Intervention''. New York: Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-704150-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  If disruptive behavior occurs in particular moments and contexts, then a corrective intervention is required. If the aim is [[school violence]] reduction, then tertiary preventive intervention programs are needed. If an early diagnosis of [[learning disability|learning difficulties]] is carried out, then psychologist has undertaken secondary prevention. If the aim is to use psycho-educational programs to prevent future school failure, then a primary preventative intervention program is put into practice.  The complement to all of these interventions is constituted by a series of optimizing activities, meant for the academic, professional, social, family, and personal improvement of all agents in educational community, especially learners.

A fourth function, or specific activity, is referral of those suffering dysfunctions to other professionals, following a previous diagnostic evaluation, with the aim to coordinate future treatment implementation. This coordination will take place with parents, teachers and other professionals, promoting collaboration among all educational agents in order to get the fastest and best case resolution. This second triangle represents the essential components of school psychology, for some European researchers or division 16 of [[American Psychological Association|APA]].

==Academic requirements==
Nowadays it is a specific Doctoral degree (Masters in Scotland) which generally completes the professional preparation of educational psychologists in the UK.  In this Doctorate in Educational Psychology, it is essential a main course which prepares educational psychologists for carrying out diagnostic and psycho-[[educational assessment]], psychological counseling to the educational communities, and all types of communitarian interventions (corrective, preventive and optimizing).  Trainees also develop external professional practices (where the specific coordination, evaluation, counseling, and intervention functions will be put into practice) on placement in local authorities, as well as a final thesis.  Equally, there are a series of theoretical areas that, due to their relevancy in the teaching/learning contexts, should be included, such as: classroom diversity, drug-dependency prevention, developmental disorders, learning difficulties, new technologies applied to educational contexts and data analysis and interpretation. In sum, taking into account all of this, perhaps educational psychologists will be able to meet adequately demands found in different educational institutions.

The following qualifications are required: an undergraduate degree in psychology (or approved postgraduate conversion course which confers the BPS Graduate Basis for Registration) and a BPS accredited Doctorate in Educational Psychology (3 years), or, for Scotland only, an accredited master's degree in Educational Psychology.  Whilst teaching experience is relevant, it is no longer an entry requirement.  At least one year's full-time experience of working with children in educational, childcare or community settings is required and for some courses this may be two years' experience.

To use the term Educational Psychologist in the UK, one will need to be registered with the Health Care Professionals Council (HCPC), which involves completing a course (Doctorate or Masters) approved by the HCPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/educational_psychologist_entry_requirements.htm|title=Educational psychologist job profile - Prospects.ac.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the United States ===

In the most basic sense of standards for education requirements in the United States an educational psychologist needs a bachelor's degree, followed by a master's degree, and commonly finishing with a PhD or a PsyD in Educational Psychology.&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careersinpsychology.org/educational-psychologist/|title=How To Become an Educational Psychologist - Education Requirements - Salary Data - CareersinPsychology.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in California, an educational psychologist candidate (commonly referred to as a LEP or Licensed Educational Psychologist) must have a minimum of a master's degree in psychology or a related field in educational psychology. This degree must be couple with a minimum of three years of experience including two years as a credential school psychologist and one year of supervised professional experience in an accredited school psychology program. After completing these requirements a candidate will then taken an LEP examination to determine if the applicant will be approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.ca.gov/app-reg/lep.shtml|title=Licensed Educational Psychologist (LEP) Requirements - California Board of Behavioral Sciences|first=California Board of Behavioral|last=Sciences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.ca.gov/pdf/forms/lep/lepapp.pdf|title=LICENSED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST APPLICATION PACKET}}&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are widely accepted by the Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) and are considered the common standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-neuropsychologist.com/html/body_common_questions_child_psychol.html|title=Common Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610003301/http://child-neuropsychologist.com/html/body_common_questions_child_psychol.html|archivedate=June 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; States may have varying standards but the aforementioned standards are a commonality when working in a school setting. Another route that can be followed is in the research field. It involves many of the same standards without the direct link of being in a school setting.&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"/&gt; Those with a research setting are typically employed through a university and do research based on their own and others findings. They may also teach at the university in their respective field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehe.osu.edu/educational-studies/educational-psychology/|title=Educational Psychology - College of Education and Human Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job availability/outlook and salary==

The average salary of an educational psychologist is variable dependent on where the psychologist depends on practicing. In a school setting the professional can expect to make around $68,000 a year; however, these professionals are commonly [[school psychologist]]s who have a different background than educational psychologists.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpsychologycareers.com/salary/educational-psychologist-salaries.html|title=Educational Psychology Salary &amp; Growth Potential|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An educational psychologist in the research and development field could expect to make around $84,000 per year.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt; Both of these averages could be considered inflated with another source listing the average income of an educational psychologist at around $57,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/salary/Educational-Psychologist.html|title=Educational Psychologist Salary - Indeed.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the resounding majority seems to sit at the $67,000 per year range making the previous income average considerably modest.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/articles/Educational_Psychology_Job_Description_Salary_and_Outlook.html|title=Educational Psychology: Job Description, Salary and Outlook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest statistics released in 2010 by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] place the median annual salary at $72,540 – showing an increase over a four-year period&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"/&gt; – compared to the median household income of the United States which is currently at $51,000. Educational psychologists make approximately 40% more than the average American, making it an advantageous field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[[Household income in the United States#Median inflation-adjusted .28.22real.22.29 household income]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Job outlook in the field of educational psychology is considered in good condition. By national estimates (US) growth in the field ranges from 11–15% between 2006–2022.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com"/&gt; A report released in 2006 the rate of growth was listed as 15% from 2006–2016,&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt; and a separate report released put the growth percentage at a modest 11% from 2012–2022.  Considering most job outlook growth percentages of the time, educational psychologists had the highest in the psychology field and was also considered the highest amongst all occupations at the time of its release in 2006.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt;

'''''Emile, or On Education'''''&lt;!--[sic] (edition: Appleton &amp; Company, 1908); all with the exception of three (1892/1908, 1899, 1983) translations to English use the unaccented form of the name.--&gt; ({{lang-fr|Émile, ou De l’éducation}}) is a treatise on the nature of [[education]] and on the nature of [[man]] written by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who considered it to be the "best and most important" of all his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. ''The Confessions''. Trans. J.M. Cohen. New York: Penguin (1953), 529-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a section of the book entitled "Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar", ''Emile'' was banned in [[Paris]] and [[Geneva]] and was publicly burned in 1762, the year of its first publication.&lt;ref&gt;E. Montin, "Introduction to J. Rousseau's Émile: or, Treatise on education by Jean-Jacques Rousseau", William Harold Payne, transl. (D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1908) [https://books.google.com/books?id=15acAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=Emile+burned&amp;ei=sPL6SrHPDIzIyQSXw4CUDw&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Emile%20burned&amp;f=false p. 316].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[French Revolution]], ''Emile'' served as the inspiration for what became a new national system of education.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bloch traces the reception of ''Emile'' in France, particularly amongst the revolutionaries, in his book ''Rousseauism and Education in Eighteenth-century France'' Oxford: Voltaire Foundation (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and philosophy==
The work tackles fundamental [[political philosophy|political]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions about the relationship between the [[individual]] and [[society]]—how, in particular, the individual might retain what Rousseau saw as [[noble savage|innate human goodness]] while remaining part of a corrupting collectivity. Its opening sentence: "Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man".

Rousseau seeks to describe a system of education that would enable the ''natural man'' he identifies in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762) to survive corrupt society.&lt;ref name="Boyd1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Boyd|title=The Educational Theory of Jean Jacques Rousseau|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKRJNAEACAAJ|year=1963|publisher=Russell|isbn=978-0-8462-0359-9|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employs the [[novelist]]ic device of Emile and his [[tutor]] to illustrate how such an ideal [[citizen]] might be educated. ''Emile'' is scarcely a detailed [[parenting]] guide but it does contain some specific advice on raising [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, responding in frustration to what he perceived as a gross misunderstanding of his text, wrote in ''Lettres de la montagne'': "Il s'sagit d'un nouveau système d'èducation dont j'offre le plan à l'examen des sages, et non pas d'une méthode pour les pères et les mères, à laquelle je n'ai jamais songé". [It is about a new system of education, whose outline I offer up for learned scrutiny, and not a method for fathers and mothers,  which I've never contemplated.] Qtd. in Peter Jimack, ''Rousseau: Émile''. London: Grant and Cutler, Ltd. (1983), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded by some as the first [[philosophy of education]] in [[Western culture]] to have a serious claim to completeness, as well as being one of the first ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' novels.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. ''Emile.'' Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books (1979), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book divisions==
The text is divided into five ''books'': the first three are dedicated to the child Emile, the fourth to an exploration of the [[adolescent]], and the fifth to outlining the education of his female counterpart Sophie, as well as to Emile's domestic and civic life.

In Book I, Rousseau discusses not only his fundamental philosophy but also begins to outline how one would have to raise a child to conform with that philosophy. He begins with the early physical and emotional development of the infant and the child.

''Emile'' attempts to "find a way of resolving the contradictions between the natural man who is 'all for himself' and the implications of life in society".&lt;ref&gt;Jimack, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous opening line does not bode well for the educational project—"Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. ''Emile, or On Education''. Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books (1979), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; But Rousseau acknowledges that every society "must choose between making a man or a citizen"&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the best "social institutions are those that best know how to denature man, to take his absolute existence from him in order to give him a relative one and transport the I into the common unity".&lt;ref&gt;Roussesau, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; To "denature man" for Rousseau is to suppress some of the "natural" instincts that he extols in ''[[The Social Contract]]'', published the same year as ''Emile'', but while it might seem that for Rousseau such a process would be entirely negative, this is not so. ''Emile'' is not a panegyric for the loss of the noble savage, a term Rousseau never actually used. Instead, it is an effort to explain how natural man can live within society.

Many of Rousseau's suggestions in this book are restatements of the ideas of other educational reformers. For example, he endorses [[John Locke|Locke]]'s program of "harden[ing children's] bodies against the intemperance of season, climates, elements; against hunger, thirst, fatigue".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasizes the perils of swaddling and the benefits of mothers nursing their own infants. Rousseau's enthusiasm for [[breastfeeding]] led to him to argue: "[B]ut let mothers deign to nurse their children, morals will reform themselves, nature's sentiments will be awakened in every heart, the state will be repeopled"&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;—a hyperbole that demonstrates Rousseau's commitment to grandiose rhetoric. As Peter Jimack, the noted Rousseau scholar, argues: "Rousseau consciously sought to find the striking, lapidary phrase which would compel the attention of his readers and move their hearts, even when it meant, as it often did, an exaggeration of his thought". And, in fact, Rousseau's pronouncements, although not original, effected a revolution in [[swaddling]] and breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;Jimack, 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book II===
The second book concerns the initial interactions of the child with the world. Rousseau believed that at this phase the education of children should be derived less from books and more from the child's interactions with the world, with an emphasis on developing the senses, and the ability to draw [[inference|inferences]] from them. Rousseau concludes the chapter with an example of a boy who has been successfully educated through this phase. The father takes the boy out flying kites, and asks the child to infer the position of the kite by looking only at the shadow. This is a task that the child has never specifically been taught, but through inference and understanding of the physical world, the child is able to succeed in his task. In some ways, this approach is the precursor of the [[Montessori education|Montessori method]].

===Book III===
The third book concerns the selection of a [[Tradesman|trade]]. Rousseau believed it necessary that the child must be taught a manual skill appropriate to his gender and age, and suitable to his inclinations, by worthy role models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Emile or On Education|year=1979|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465-01931-1|pages=202–207|url=https://archive.org/stream/RousseausemileOrOnEducationbloom/Rousseau-Emile#page/n201/mode/2up/search/trade|editor=translation and notes by Allan Bloom|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book IV===
[[Image:EmileFrontispiece.jpeg|thumb|Frontispiece to Rousseau's ''Émile'' by De Launay for the 1782 edition. The original caption reads: "L'éducation de l'homme commence à sa naissance" ("A man's education begins at birth").&lt;ref&gt;Trouille, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Once Emile is physically strong and learns to carefully observe the world around him, he is ready for the last part of his education—sentiment: "We have made an active and thinking being. It remains for us, in order to complete the man, only to make a loving and feeling being—that is to say, to perfect reason by sentiment".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Emile is a teenager at this point and it is only now that Rousseau believes he is capable of understanding complex human emotions, particularly sympathy. Rousseau argues that the child cannot put himself in the place of others but once adolescence has been reached and he is able do so, Emile can finally be brought into the world and socialized.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to introducing a newly passionate Emile to society during his adolescent years, the tutor also introduces him to religion.  According to Rousseau, children cannot understand abstract concepts such as the soul before the age of about fifteen or sixteen, so to introduce religion to them is dangerous. He writes: "It is a lesser evil to be unaware of the divinity than to offend it".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because children are incapable of understanding the difficult concepts that are part of religion, he points out that children will only recite what is told to them—they are unable to believe.

Book IV also contains the famous "Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar", the section that was largely responsible for the condemnation of ''Emile'' and the one most frequently excerpted and published independently of its parent tome. Rousseau writes at the end of the "Profession": "I have transcribed this writing not as a rule for the sentiments that one ought to follow in religious matters, but as an example of the way one can reason with one’s pupil in order not to diverge from the method I have tried to establish".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau, through the priest, leads his readers through an argument which concludes only to belief in "[[natural religion]]": "If he must have another religion", Rousseau writes (that is, beyond a basic "natural religion"), "I no longer have the right to be his guide in that".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book V===
In Book V, Rousseau turns to the education of Sophie, Emile's wife-to-be. This brief description of female education sparked an immense contemporary response, perhaps even more so than ''Emile'' itself. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], for example, dedicated a substantial portion of her chapter "Animadversions on Some of the Writers who have Rendered Women Objects of Pity, Bordering on Contempt" in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) to attacking Rousseau and his arguments. 

When responding to Rousseau’s argument in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft directly quotes Émile, ou De l’éducation in Chapter IV of her piece:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Educate women like men,' says Rousseau [in Émile, ou De l’éducation], 'and the more they resemble our sex the less power will they have over us.' This is the very point I aim at. I do not wish them to have power over men; but over themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wollstonecraft|first1=Mary|title=A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|date=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

French writer [[Louise d'Épinay]]'s Conversations d'Emilie made her disagreement with Rousseau’s take on female education clear as well. Indeed, she believes that females’ education affects their role in society, not natural differences as Rousseau claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hageman|first1=Jeanne Kathryn|title="Les Conversations d'Emilie": The education of women by women in eighteenth century France|journal=he University of Wisconsin - Madison|date=1991|page=28|oclc=25301342}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Rousseau begins his description of Sophie, the ideal woman, by describing the inherent differences between men and women in a famous passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In what they have in common, they are equal. Where they differ, they are not comparable. A perfect woman and a perfect man ought not to resemble each other in mind any more than in looks, and perfection is not susceptible of more or less. In the union of the sexes each contributes equally to the common aim, but not in the same way. From this diversity arises the first assignable difference in the moral relations of the two sexes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Rousseau, "everything man and woman have in common belongs to the species, and ... everything which distinguishes them belongs to the sex".&lt;ref name="Rousseau, 358"&gt;Rousseau, 358.&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau states that women should be "passive and weak", "put up little resistance" and are "made specially to please man"; he adds, however, that "man ought to please her in turn", and he explains the dominance of man as a function of "the sole fact of his strength", that is, as a strictly "natural" law, prior to the introduction of "the law of love".&lt;ref name="Rousseau, 358"/&gt;

Rousseau also touches on the political upbringing of Emile in book V by including a concise version of his ''[[The Social Contract|Social Contract]]'' in the book. His political treatise ''The Social Contract'' was published in the same year as ''Emile'' and was likewise soon banned by the government for its controversial theories on [[general will]]. The version of this work in ''Emile'', however, does not go into detail concerning the tension between the Sovereign and the Executive, but instead refer the reader to the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Deneen, ''The Odyssey of Political Theory, pp. 145. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X02TzN09yHYC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=social+contract+book+v+emile&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l2eG1F27Jg&amp;sig=6BDil5zFfJyKO6j45NWNHyDJP9Q&amp;hl=da&amp;ei=J5BMStKFKuCOjAfB4f28BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau’s stance on female education, much like the other ideas explored in Émile, ou De l’éducation, “crystallize existing feelings” of the time period. During the eighteenth century, women’s education was traditionally focused on domestic skills—including sewing, housekeeping, and cooking—as they were encouraged to stay within their suitable spheres, which Rousseau advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Todd|first1=Christopher|title=The Modern Language Review|journal=The Modern Language Review|date=1998|volume=93|issue=4|page=1111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Émile et Sophie'' ==
In the incomplete sequel to ''Emile'', ''Émile et Sophie'' (English: ''Emilius and Sophia''), published after Rousseau's death, Sophie is unfaithful (in what is hinted at might be a drugged rape), and Emile, initially furious with her betrayal, remarks "the adulteries of the women of the world are not more than gallantries; but Sophia an adulteress is the most odious of all monsters; the distance between what she was, and what she is, is immense. No! there is no disgrace, no crime equal to hers".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. ''Emilius and Sophia; or, The Solitaries''. London: Printed by H. Baldwin. (1783), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He later relents somewhat, blaming himself for taking her to a city full of temptation, but he still abandons her and their children. Throughout the agonized internal monologue, represented through letters to his old tutor, he repeatedly comments on all of the affective ties that he has formed in his domestic life—"the chains [his heart] forged for itself".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''Émile et Sophie'', 46.&lt;/ref&gt; As he begins to recover from the shock, the reader is led to believe that these "chains" are not worth the price of possible pain—"By renouncing my attachments to a single spot, I extended them to the whole earth, and, while I ceased to be a citizen, became truly a man".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''Émile et Sophie'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt; While in ''La Nouvelle Héloïse'' the ideal is domestic, rural happiness (if not bliss), in ''Emile'' and its sequel the ideal is "emotional self-sufficiency which was the natural state of primitive, pre-social man, but which for modern man can be attained only by the suppression of his natural inclinations".&lt;ref&gt;Jimack, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Wilson Paiva, member of the Rousseau Association, "[L]eft unfinished, ''Émile et Sophie'' reminds us of Rousseau's incomparable talent for producing a brilliant conjugation of literature and philosophy, as well as a productive approach of sentiment and reason through education".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/3753090/_Re_visiting_Emile_after_marriage_the_importance_of_an_appendix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Rousseau's contemporary and philosophical rival [[Voltaire]] was critical of ''Emile'' as a whole, but admired the section in the book which had led to it being banned (the section titled "Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar"). According to Voltaire, ''Emile'' is {{Quote|a hodgepodge of a silly wet nurse in four volumes, with forty pages against Christianity, among the boldest ever known...He says as many hurtful things against the philosophers as against Jesus Christ, but the philosophers will be more indulgent than the priests.}}

However, Voltaire went on to endorse the ''Profession of Faith'' section and called it "fifty good pages... it is regrettable that they should have been written by... such a knave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|pages=190–191|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German scholar [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] wrote in 1787 that "Emile and its sentiments had a universal influence on the cultivated mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|pages=889|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Everett Dean Martin''' (July 5, 1880 – May 10, 1941) was an American minister, writer, journalist, instructor, lecturer, [[social psychologist]], [[social philosopher]], and an advocate of [[adult education]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Day, "A primary source for Everett Dean Martin's agenda for adult education" http://roghiemstra.com/day.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an instructor and lecturer at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]] from 1921-1929, and served on the Board of Directors of [[The New School]] from 1925-1932.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the final Director of the [[Charles Sprague Smith|People's Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6n0522b&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cooper Union]] in [[New York City]] from 1922-1934.  Martin was born in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]] on July 5, 1880.  Graduating with honors at the age of 24 from [[Illinois College]] in Jacksonville, he moved on to Chicago, attending [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] from 1904 until his ordination as a Congregational Minister in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin received a Litt.D (Doctor of Letters) degree from [[Illinois College]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanford Daily, Volume 83a, Issue 15, 15 August 1933&lt;/ref&gt;  He was best known for his advocacy of the liberal education of adults, which he saw as “an antidote to both the [[irrationality]] of the [[crowd manipulation|crowd]] and the power of [[propaganda]].”&lt;ref&gt;Rose, A.D. (1999). Everett Dean Martin. In J.A. a. C. Garraty, Mark C. (Ed.), American National Biography (Vol. 14, pp. 589-591). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1907, he married Esther W. Kirk of Jacksonville, Illinois.  They had three children: Mary, Margaret, and Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan, Caryn, Illinois Biographical Dictionary, 2008-2009 Edition, Volume One., State History Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1906-1908, Martin was Pastor of the [[Maple Street Chapel|First Congregational Church]] (now called The First Church of Lombard) of Lombard, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstchurchoflombard.org/2016/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://adulteducationcontributors.pbworks.com/w/page/54988015/58%20Everett%20Dean%20Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1908-1911, Martin was Pastor of the People’s Church in Dixon, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;http://adulteducationcontributors.pbworks.com/w/page/54988015/58%20Everett%20Dean%20Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin was minister of the First [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Church of [[Des Moines]], Iowa, 1911-1915

Martin was a featured columnist for the [[Des Moines Register]] during the years 1914-1915.&lt;ref&gt;http://roghiemstra.com/day.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, his successful life took a radical shift in course.  He divorced his wife of eight years and left the professional ministry.  He moved to New York and began writing for the [[New York Globe]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Frye, “Everett Dean Martin: Misunderstood Champion of Adult Education,” Carson-Newman Studies, Vol. X, No 3, Fall 2004, pp. 84-98, ISSN 1081-7727.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next 20 years, Martin developed into a successful writer and forged a national reputation as a charismatic public lecturer, often attracting a crowd of a thousand or more at the [[Charles Sprague Smith|People's Institute]], a major center for adult education in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Day and Clifford P. Harbour, The Philosopher and the Lecturer: John Dewey, Everett Dean Martin, and Reflective Thinking., Education and Culture, Vol. 29 (1), 2013, pp.105-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin's second marriage in 1915 to Persis Eastman Rowell also ended in divorce, they had one son, Everett Eastman.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan, Caryn, Illinois Biographical Dictionary, 2008-2009 Edition, Volume One., State History Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentary on the early 20th century ==
In ''The Behavior of Crowds'' (1920), his first nationally reviewed book, he posed what he saw as the dilemma of the modern age: a technological information revolution that made it possible, in the absence of an adequate educational system, to influence ignorant men and women with [[propaganda]] and half-truths.  Unscrupulous [[demagogues]], corrupt politicians, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertisers, and revolutionary [[ideologues]] found ready-made audiences when they appealed to the baser (a subconscious urge, behavior, or intuition directed by primeval, animalistic, self-serving, and/or ignoble motivations) instincts.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was a [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[individualistic]] [[Liberalism|liberal]], in the tradition of the [[Renaissance]] [[humanists]] and the authors of [[The Federalist Papers]]. He believed in restrained government and in the self-selection of intellectually promising students through appropriate programs of adult education.

His most famous and widely read work, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education'', appeared in 1926, the same year he helped found the American Association for Adult Education.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  When his book, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education'' was released in 1926, [[Frederick Paul Keppel]], the president of the [[Carnegie Corporation]] proclaimed it as “the most important contribution to the understanding of [[adult education]]… this far in the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;Day, M., J, &amp; Seckinger, D. (1987, May 21–23). Everett Dean Martin: Spiritual leader of the adult education movement in the United States.  Paper presented at the Adult Education Research Conference Proceedings, Laramie, Wyoming.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1928, [[John Dewey]] responded to a request from [[Marie Mattingly Meloney]], editor of the [[New York Herald-Tribune]] Sunday Magazine, and offered his recommendations on recently published texts on education.  [[John Dewey|Dewey]] wrote, “I think the best educational books of recent publication are…Martin, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education''.  This was not the first time [[John Dewey|Dewey]] recommended Everett Dean Martin’s book.  In 1927, the editors of the Journal of the [[National Education Association]] approached [[John Dewey|Dewey]] and asked, “What book have you recently found especially worthwhile?  Something that you have read easily, eagerly, and with profit, either in the field of education or out of it.”  [[John Dewey|Dewey]] identified two books; one of them was Martin’s ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Day and Clifford P. Harbour, The Philosopher and the Lecturer: John Dewey, Everett Dean Martin, and Reflective Thinking., Education and Culture, Vol. 29 (1), 2013, pp.105-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1919-1922, Martin served as chairman of The [[National Board of Review]] of Motion Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, A.D. (1999). Everett Dean Martin. In J.A. a. C. Garraty, Mark C. (Ed.), American National Biography (Vol. 14, pp. 589-591). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was an instructor and lecturer at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]] from 1921-1929, and served on the Board of Directors of [[The New School]] from 1925-1932.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught classes in sociology, psychology, social behavior, and adult education.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[The New School]], Martin taught alongside other prominent intellectuals of the day including, [[Alfred Adler]], [[Norman Angell]], [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], [[Charles Austin Beard]], [[Edwin Grant Conklin]], [[Herbert J. Davenport]], [[John Dewey]], [[Lawrence K. Frank]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]], [[Joseph Jastrow]], [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Alfred Kreymborg]], [[Eduard C. Lindeman]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Frederick Macaulay]], [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]], [[Gorham Munson]], [[Moissaye Joseph Olgin]], [[Harry Allen Overstreet]], [[James Harvey Robinson]], [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], and [[Leo Wolman]].&lt;ref&gt;The Survey, “The New School, A Laboratory of Social Sciences.” (Advertisement), Volume 46, August 16th, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the courses Martin taught at [[The New School]] between 1921 and 1929 were: Introduction to Social Psychology, Fundamental Problems in Adult Education, The Process of Adult Learning, Psychology and the Problems of Social Behavior, Some Applications of Social Psychology, Studies on Social Behavior, and Psychological Problems of Social Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of Martin’s lecture topics in from a 1925 course on [[social philosophy]] taught at [[The New School]] include: The [[Psychology]] of the [[Crowd psychology|Crowd]]; The So-Called [[Collective consciousness|Group Mind]]; Has Man a Social or [[Herd behavior|”Herd”]] Instinct?; The [[Psychology]] of Mass Appeal; Leadership in the [[Crowd psychology|Crowd]]; Reform Legislation; The Present Industrial Transition.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Why is this seminal individual virtually ignored amidst the ranks of the founders of the [[adult education]] movement?  Apparently Martin’s wholehearted commitment to liberal education has placed him in juxtaposition with the early proponents of practical education in the eyes of contemporary scholars.  Here is an individual virtually dismissed not only in the history of [[adult education]], but also in the contemporary exploration of [[adult education]].”&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Frye, “Everett Dean Martin: Misunderstood Champion of Adult Education,” Carson-Newman Studies, Vol. X, No 3, Fall 2004, pp. 84-98, ISSN 1081-7727.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those recruited to the programs of the [[Charles Sprague Smith|People's Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6n0522b&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cooper Union]] during Martin’s tenure as Director (1926-1934) had been [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Will Durant]], [[Clifton Fadiman]], and [[Hilda Worthington Smith]], all soon to surpass Martin in fame and influence.  Yet, in his heyday, Martin was regarded as one of the leading figures in [[adult education]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartwright, who was the Executive Director of the American Association for Adult Education from its founding in 1926 to its ultimate dissolution and transformation in 1949, considered Martin to be the "spiritual father" of the association in particular and of the entire movement in general.&lt;ref&gt;Morse A. Cartwright, "Everett Dean Martin," Journal of Adult Education, 13 (1941): 324&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright went on to say in his eulogy for Martin, published in the Journal of Adult Education, that:

“. . . Thousands who had heard him lecture in all parts of the United States, more thousands who had read his numerous books and articles on philosophical and psychological subjects, and the large audience which for years listened to his notable Friday night addresses and discussions in the Great Hall of [[Cooper Union]] in New York, all attested to the challenging qualities of his mind and heart.”&lt;ref&gt;Morse A. Cartwright, "Everett Dean Martin," Journal of Adult Education, 13 (1941): 324&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Martin was asked to direct the Department of Social Philosophy at the [[Cooper Union]] in [[New York City|New York]] through a $15,000 per year grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]] through his long-time friend [[Frederick Paul Keppel]].  Martin remained in this position until 1936 when he accepted an opportunity to move to California and direct an experimental program in teaching at [[Claremont Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Frye, “Everett Dean Martin: Misunderstood Champion of Adult Education,” Carson-Newman Studies, Vol. X, No 3, Fall 2004, pp. 84-98, ISSN 1081-7727.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was a Professor of [[Social Psychology]] at [[Scripps College]] in [[Claremont, California]] from 1936 up until his death in 1941.

'''Experiential education''' is a philosophy of education that describes the process that occurs between a teacher and student that infuses direct experience with the [[learning environment]] and content.&lt;ref&gt;Itin, C. M. (1999). Reasserting the Philosophy of Experiential Education as a Vehicle for Change in the 21st Century. The Journal of Experiential Education,.22(2), 91-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is not interchangeable with [[experiential learning]]; however experiential learning is a sub-field and operates under the methodologies of experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;Breuning, M., &amp; O'Connell, T. (2008, Spring/Summer). An overview of Outdoor Experiential Education. Taproot, 10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Experiential Education]] regards experiential education as "a philosophy that informs many methodologies in which educators purposefully engage with learners in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people's capacity to contribute to their communities".&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.aee.org/about/whatIsEE/ "What is Experiential Education?"], Association for Experiential Education,  Retrieved 8/7/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Experiential education is the term for the philosophy and [[educational progressivism]] is the movement which it informed.

==About==
[[John Dewey]] was the most famous proponent of experiential education, writing ''[[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]]'' (1938).  It expressed his ideas about curriculum theory in the context of historical debates about school organization and the need to have experience as central in the educational process; hence, experiential education is referred to as a philosophy. Dewey's fame during that period rested on relentlessly critiquing public education and pointing out that the [[authoritarian]], strict, pre-ordained knowledge approach of modern traditional education was too concerned with delivering knowledge, and not enough with understanding students' experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilderdom.com/experiential/ExperientialDewey.html Neil, J. (2005) "John Dewey, the Modern Father of Experiential Education"], Wilderdom.com. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's work influenced dozens of other prominent experiential models and advocates in the later 20th century, including [[Foxfire Fund|Foxfire]],&lt;ref&gt;Starnes, B.A. (1999) [http://www.ericdigests.org/1999-3/foxfire.htm "The Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning: John Dewey, Experiential Learning, and the Core Practices."] ERIC Digests - ED426826. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[service learning]],&lt;ref&gt;Giles, D.E., Jr., &amp; Eyler, J. (1994). [http://www.umich.edu/%7Emjcsl/volumes/vol1abstracts.html#vol1-9 "Theoretical roots of service learning in John Dewey: Toward a theory of service learning."] ''Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning'', Fall, 77-85. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Hahn]] and [[Outward Bound]],&lt;ref&gt;Gass, M. (2003) "Kurt Hahn address 2002 AEE International Conference", ''Journal of Experiential Education.'' 25 (3), pp. 363-371&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paulo Freire]]. Freire is often cited in works on experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;Bing, A. (1989) "Peace Studies as Experiential Education," ''[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]. 504.'', pp. 48–60.&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on the participation by students in experience and [[radical democracy]], and the creation of ''[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]'' among learners.

John Dewey was an educator, but he was foremost a philosopher. His interests included political philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, logic, and [[philosophy of education]].  [[Political philosophy]] was one of his many philosophical interests.  He saw weaknesses in both the traditional and progressive styles of education. He explains in length his criticisms of both forms of education in his book, ''Experience &amp; Education'' (1938). In essence, he did not believe that they met the goals of education, which he defined as obtaining freedom of thought. Dewey did not believe in freedom of thought in any kind of absolute sense.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Dewey advocated that education be based upon the quality of experience. For an experience to be educational, Dewey believed that certain parameters had to be met, the most important of which is that the experience has continuity and interaction. Continuity is the idea that the experience comes from and leads to other experiences, in essence propelling the person to learn more. Interaction is when the experience meets the internal needs or goals of a person. Dewey also categorizes experiences as possibly being mis-educative and non-educative. A mis-educative experience is one that stops or distorts growth for future experiences. A non-educative experience is one in which a person has not done any reflection and so has obtained nothing for mental growth that is lasting (''Experience &amp; Education,'' Dewey).

In addition to the notions raised by Dewey, recent research has shown that experiential learning does not replace traditional methods of learning but supplements it in the form of [[laboratory]] and clinical learning to offer additional skills, perspectives, and understanding of relationships. Instead, experiential learning is designed to improve one's understanding by giving one the freedom to explore and find the learning path that is most suitable for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Forecasting%20the%20Air%20Travel%20Market.pdf | title = Designing and using experiential exercises | author = [[J. Scott Armstrong]]| journal = Experiential Learning in Marketing Education | pages = 8–17 | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

The methodologies reflected in experiential education have evolved since the time of Hahn and Dewey. For experiential education to become efficient pedagogy, physical experience must be combined with reflection.&lt;ref name="Howden, E. 2012 pp. 43-51"&gt;Howden, E. (2012) "Outdoor Experiential Education: Learning Through the Body," New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education. 134, pp. 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding reflective practice, allows for personal introspection of challenges and key learnings. That is, physical challenges provide a gateway in which we can observe qualities about ourselves, and those whom we are working with. Further, for the efficacy of experiential education, experiences must be separated, giving the learner sufficient time to process the information.&lt;ref name="Howden, E. 2012 pp. 43-51"/&gt;

Experiential education informs many educational practices underway in [[school]]s ([[formal education]]) and out-of-school ([[informal education]]) programs. Many [[teaching methods]] rely on experiential education to provide context and frameworks for learning through action and reflection while others at higher levels (university and professional education) focus on field skills and modeling.

*[[Outdoor education]] uses organized learning activities that occur in the outdoors, and uses environmental experiences as a learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V., &amp; Golins, G. L. (1976). ''[http://wilderdom.com/theory/OutwardBoundProcessModel.html The exploration of the Outward Bound process]''.  Denver, CO: [[Colorado Outward Bound School]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Service learning]] is a combination of [[community service]] with stated learning goals, relying on experience as the foundation for meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Furco, A. (1996) ''Expanding Boundaries: Serving and Learning,'' Florida Campus Compact.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cooperative learning]] alters [[homogeneous]] groupings in order to support diverse [[learning styles]] and needs within a group.&lt;ref&gt;McInnerney J., &amp; Roberts, T.S. (2005). "Collaborative and Cooperative Learning," In ''The Encyclopedia of Distance Learning, Volume 1: Online Learning and Technologies.'' Hershey, PA: Information Science Publishing, pp. 269–276.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Active learning]], a term popular in US education circles in the 1980s, encourages learners to take responsibility for their learning, requiring their experience in education to inform their process of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bonwell, C. and Eison, J. (1991) ''Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom.'' Washington, D.C.: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Environmental education]] is based in educating learners about relationships within the natural environment and how those relationships are interdependent. Students participate in outdoor activities as part of their learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J.A. (1998) ''Environmental Education in the 21st Century: Theory, Practice, Progress, and Promise.'' New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Vocational education]] involves training for an occupation.
*[[Sandwich degree|Sandwich degrees]] involve a year working in industry during academic study.

Experiential education serves as an umbrella for linking many diverse practices into a coherent whole.  Its philosophy is closely linked to numerous other educational theories, but it should not be conflated with [[progressive education]], [[critical pedagogy]], [[youth empowerment]], feminist-based education, and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. The development of experiential education as a philosophy has been intertwined with the development of these other educational theories; their contrasts have clarified differences.

Fellowships and other training programs are available for experiential educators; but, formal training in experiential methods is lacking for K-12 undergraduate teaching programs (see Wendel, A. and Mantil, A., (2008) and the [http://www.nsee.org/ National Society for Experiential Education]).

== Examples ==
Examples of experiential education can be found in various disciplines. The educator [[Lucy Calkins]] writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we asked our students for the highlight of their school careers, most would choose a time when they dedicated themselves to an endeavor of great importance...I am thinking of youngsters from P.S. 321, who have launched a save-the-tree campaign to prevent the oaks outside their school from being cut down. I am thinking of children who write the school newspaper, act in the school play, organize the playground building committee.... On projects such as these, youngsters will work before school, after school, during lunch. Our youngsters want to work hard on endeavors they deem significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Living Between the Lines |last1=Calkins |first1=Lucy McCormick |last2=Harwayne |first2=Shelley |publisher=Heinemann |year=1991 |isbn=0435085387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing [[Diary|journals]] proves to be quite effective as part of English classes. Specifically, by writing "personal" and "text-related" journals, students find meaning in their own thoughts as well as in concepts learned in class. Personal [[Writing therapy|journaling]] is the recording of past and present personal thoughts and events in the student's life to enhance [[self-awareness]], student interest, and learning. Text-related journaling is writing about concepts learned in class in relation to students' personal experiences, to promote understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strategies that Work: Journals in the Classroom|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/strategy/strategy013.shtml|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other programs==

The [[Nicodemus Wilderness Project]] provides an environmental experiential education program with a global reach called the "Apprentice Ecologist Initiative".  This scholarship-based opportunity is targeted for youth volunteers who want to help protect the environment.  The initiative seeks to develop young people for leadership roles by engaging them in environmental cleanup and conservation projects, empower volunteers to rebuild the environmental and social well-being of our communities, and improve local living conditions for both citizens and wildlife.

[[Presidential Classroom]], a non-profit civic education organization in [[Washington D.C.]], is open to high school students from across the country and abroad.  They meet and interact with government officials, media correspondents, congressman, and key players on the world stage to learn how public policy shapes many aspects of citizens' lives.  Students travel to Washington and spend a week hearing from prominent speakers, meet with interest group spokesmen and tour the national capital.  Students participate in a group project directed by experienced instructors; they have mediated debates on current issues facing the country.  The focus of the week is to give students a hands-on introduction to how "real world" politics take place.

[[Global College]], a four-year international study program offered by [[Long Island University]], is based on self-guided, experiential learning while a student is immersed in foreign cultures. Regional centers employ mostly advisors rather than teaching faculty; these advisors guide the individual students in preparing a "portfolio of learning" each semester to display the results of their experiences and projects.

The [[New England Literature Program]] in the English Department at the [[University of Michigan]] is a 45-day program, in which University instructors live and work together with 40  UM students in the woods of Maine in early spring.  They intensively study 19th and 20th-century  New England literature, in a program that includes creative writing in the form of academic journaling, as well as a deep physical engagement with the landscape of New England.  NELP students and staff take hiking trips into the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] and other parts of the New England natural areas each week, integrating their experience of the landscape with writing and discussion of texts.

The [[Chicago Center for Urban Life and Culture]] is the only nonprofit and independent experiential educational program for college students in the United States.  The Chicago Center is distinguished by unique seminars characterized by a 'First Voice' pedagogy, its location in the multi-ethnic [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], and development of several hundred [[intern]]ship sites in [[Chicago]]. While many of the students who attend Chicago Center grew up in cities, the majority are from suburban, rural and farming communities. Students participate individually in its Semester, May Term and Summer Session.  The Chicago Center also designs and staffs programs for groups, what it calls "LearnChicago!", which promise non-tourist experiences in the city.

[[The Philadelphia Center]] is an off-campus program based on a model of experiential education.  Recognized by The Great Lakes Colleges Association, The Philadelphia Center is currently the only undergraduate level program that supports independent living and encourages the use of the city as a [[learning space]].

Several Australian high schools have established experiential education programmes, including [[Caulfield Grammar School]]'s five-week internationalism programme in [[Nanjing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Geelong Grammar School]]'s Timbertop outdoor education programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Tarica | first=Elisabeth | title=School of life | date=21 August 2006 | publisher=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/school-of-life/2006/08/18/1155408026033.html?page=fullpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|SODOTO}}At the professional school level, experiential education is often integrated into curricula in "clinical" courses following the medical school model of "See one, Do one, Teach one", in which students learn by practicing medicine.  This approach is being introduced in other professions in which skills are directly worked into courses to teach every concept (starting with interviewing, listening skills, negotiation, contract writing and advocacy, for example) to larger-scale projects in which students run [[Legal clinic|legal aid clinics]] or community loan programs, or write legislation or community development plans.

The [[Boys and Girls Club of America]] provides a framework for youth development professionals to employ experiential learning methods.

[[Lifeworks International]] offers experiential, service-learning programs for high school students. Trips combine adventure travel, cultural immersion, community service, and global education during expeditions in China, Thailand, India, Costa Rica, Peru, the British Virgin Islands, and Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands.

In [[Legal Education]], critical pedagogy is associated with devising more equitable methods of teaching, helping students develop consciousness of freedom, and helping them connect knowledge to power.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt and Stephanie Ledesma, Experiential Education as Critical Pedagogy: Enhancing the Law School Experience, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2498782&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change in roles and structures==
Whether teachers employ experiential education in cultural journalism, [[service learning]], [[environmental education]], or more traditional school subjects, its key idea involves engaging [[student voice]] in active roles for the purpose of learning. Armstrong (2012) claims that students should be responsible for learning, not teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students participate in a real activity with real consequences for the purpose of meeting learning objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) ''[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful student involvement: Students as partners in school change]''. Olympia, WA: CommonAction. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential education uses various tools like field work, policy and civic activity, and entrepreneurship outside of the classroom along with games, simulations, role plays, stories in classrooms. The experiential education mindset changes the way the teachers and students view knowledge. Knowledge is no longer just some letters on a page. It becomes active, something that is transacted with in life or lifelike situations. It starts to make teachers experience and skill facilitators, and not just transmitters of the written word.

Besides changing student roles, experiential education requires a change in the role of teachers. When students are active learners, their endeavors often take them outside the classroom walls. Because action precedes attempts to synthesize knowledge, teachers generally cannot plan a curriculum unit as a neat, predictable package. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Teachers become active learners, too, experimenting together with their students, reflecting upon the learning activities they have designed, and responding to their students' reactions to the activities. In this way, teachers themselves become more active; they come to view themselves as more than just recipients of school district policy and curriculum decisions.

It is also important to point out that not all learners learn in the same way. As a result, there are diverse learners that have unique learning styles pertinent to their success as students. Studies have shown that cooperative learning is strongly suggested in a diverse learning atmosphere. "Contemporary views of learning and their pedagogical applications have begun to change traditional classroom interaction patterns, shaping the communicative roles of the teacher and students as participants in a classroom learning community," write David Wray &amp; Kristiina Kumpulainen. This paradigm shift in education gives both the student and teacher shared responsibility of the learning process. The teacher's participation in discussion sessions is to act as a facilitator, maintain classroom decorum, provide individual and group feedback, and alleviate concerns or issues in the lesson.

Critical thinking strategies are pertinent to the success of student-oriented learning. When students are engaged in active discussions, high-level thinking skills are put into practice to the point where students are synthesizing the information at a deeper level of understanding. According to [[Elliot Eisner]], "We need to provide opportunities for youngsters and adolescents to engage in challenging kinds of conversation, and we need to help them know how to do so. Such conversation is all too rare in schools. I use 'conversation' seriously, for challenging conversation is an intellectual affair. It has to do with thinking about what people have said and responding reflectively, analytically, and imaginatively to that process. The practice of conversation is almost a lost art. The most significant intellectual achievement is not so much in problem solving, but in question posing." Through experimental education, students are capable of finding their voice through '''peer-to-peer interaction'''. Students are now seen as [[child-centred|active participants]] in the learning process. [[Vygotsky]]`s social development theory requires students to play untraditional roles as they collaborate with one another through critical thinking and conversational skills. According to Ann Ketch, author of Conversation: The comprehension connection writes, "The oral process helps students clarify and solidify their thoughts. The thinking changes from what it was before the conversation took place. Through conversation, the student is in charge of his or her own mental processing. The teacher acts as a facilitator, pushing the student to rely upon and monitor his or her own comprehension, which fosters critical thinking." This is very vital because student conversation can elicit new ideas that may not have been mentioned or even thought of by another student. Therefore, student dialogue is very important because it helps individuals make sense of what is being learned. It also helps build respect for other's opinions while taking ownership of his or her learning process.

In experimental education, students are given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills by making connections to the real world. Therefore, effective learning entails active experimentation with a '''hands-on''' approach to learning. It is perceived that students learn more by being active. Students are '''interdependent''' in establishing group goals and decision-making skills. As a result, students are also capable of developing leadership skills, which can also enhance student motivation and confidence.

When students are given a choice in terms of content to be learned, it ensures the teacher that his or her learners are interactive in the learning process. According to Ernie Stringer, "'''Action learners''' move through continuous cycles of this inquiry process to improve their understanding, extend their knowledge, or refine their skills." When given a preference, students may feel motivated to take control of his or her learning experience. Student incentives are tied to progress in academic achievement. "Research indicates that intrinsic motivation stems from one's interests and capacities to surmount challenge s when presented or pursued," says Fenice B. Boyd. Many schools are encouraging teachers to tap into student interests with the hope that they transfer that motivation into the classroom.

Through the continuous cycle of learning, teacher's often work with students to develop a framework of knowledge, which is to be evaluated based on student input to the lessons content. Therefore, the teacher should establish criteria of what is to be learned as related to the student(s) choice in learning material. Ernie Stringer draws on the importance that "'''action research''' provides a process for developing a rich, engaging curriculum relevant to the lives and purposes of students, engaging their interests and abilities, and serving the broad human needs of community, society, and the planet. Creative construction of curricula or syllabi provides the means whereby the needs, perspectives, and/or interests of diverse stakeholders can be incorporated into vital, creative, effective programs of learning." In essence, a well-planned curriculum is designed for learning that encompasses a broad range of goals and individual needs that ensures the '''active learning''' process.

As students and teachers take on new roles, the traditional organizational structures of the school also may meet challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talpiot.macam.ac.il/hishtalmut/principles.htm Best practice: New standards for teaching and learning in America's schools.] Zemelman, Daniels, and Hyde, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the Challenger Middle School in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], service activities are an integral part of the academic program. Such nontraditional activities require teachers and administrators to look at traditional practices in new ways. For instance, they may consider reorganizing time blocks. They may also teach research methods by involving students in investigations of the community, rather than restricting research activities to the library (Rolzinski, 1990). {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

At the University Heights Alternative School in [[the Bronx]], the [[Project Adventure]] experiential learning program has led the faculty to adopt an all-day time block as an alternative to the traditional 45-minute periods. The faculty now organizes the curriculum by project instead of by separate disciplines. Schools that promote meaningful student involvement actively engage students as partners in education improvement activities. These young people learn while planning, researching, teaching, and making decisions that affect the entire education system.

Other university level programs are entirely field-taught on outdoor expeditions. These courses combine traditional academic readings and written assignments with field observations, service projects, open discussions of course material, and meetings with local speakers who are involved with the course subjects. These "hybrid" experiential/traditional programs aim to provide the academic rigor of a classroom course with the breadth and personal connections of experiential education.

==Transitions from traditional to experiential==

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|Experiential education is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015 Skill Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At first, these new roles and structures may seem unfamiliar and uncomfortable to both students and adults in the school. Traditionally, students have most often been rewarded for competing rather than cooperating with one another. Teachers are not often called upon for collaborative work either. Teaching has traditionally been an activity carried out in isolation from one's peers, behind closed doors. Principals, accustomed to the traditional hierarchical structure of schools, often do not know how to help their teachers constitute self-managed work teams or how to help teachers coach students to work in cooperative teams. The techniques of experiential education can help students and staff adjust to teamwork, an important part of the process of reforming schools.

[[Adventure education]] may use the philosophy of experiential education in developing team and group skills in both students and adults (Rohnke, 1989). Initially, [[wikt:group|groups]] work to solve problems that are unrelated to the problems in their actual [[school]] environment. For example, in a [[ropes course]] designed to build the skills required by [[teamwork]], a faculty or student [[team]] might work together to get the entire group over a 12-foot wall or through an intricate web of rope. After each challenge in a series of this kind, the group looks at how it functioned as a team:

* Who took the [[leadership]] roles?
* Did the [[planning]] process help or hinder progress?
* Did people listen to one another in the group and use the strengths of all group members?
* Did everyone feel that the group was a supportive environment in which they felt comfortable making a contribution and taking [[risks]]?

The wall or web of rope can then become a [[metaphor]] for the [[classroom]] or [[school]] environment. While the problems and challenges of the [[classroom]] or [[school]] are different from the physical challenges of the adventure activity, many skills needed to respond successfully as a team are the same in both settings.

These skills &amp;mdash; [[listening]], recognizing each other's strengths, and supporting each other through difficulties &amp;mdash; can apply equally well to an academic [[Socratic Method]] of questioning or [[problem-solving]] toward schoolwide improvement efforts.

For example, the Kane School in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] has been using adventure as a tool for [[school]] restructuring. The entire faculty &amp;mdash; particularly the Faculty Advisory Council, which shares the decisionmaking responsibilities with the principal &amp;mdash; has honed group skills through experiential education activities developed by [[Project Adventure]]. These skills include open [[communication]], methods of [[conflict resolution]], and mechanisms for [[decision making]] (High Strides, 1990).

==Development in Asian countries==

Established in 1973, ''Breakthrough'' in [[Hong Kong]] was the first non-profit organization that applied the concepts of experiential education (though primarily conceptualized in terms of outdoor adventure education) in youth works. Since then, development in experiential education has proceeded in [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]], and some large cities in [[China]].

Experiential methods in education have existed in China for thousands of years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  However, it should be noted that John Dewey was in China in the early 1900s and his ideas were extremely popular.  Interest in Dewey's experience in China and contribution is growing.

Experiential education started in [[Qatar]] in 2010 through [[AL-Bairaq]], which is an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind AL-Bairaq is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the [[Center for Advanced Materials]] (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, using a hands-on-activities approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |archivedate=19 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

There are multiple ways in which experiential education is practiced.  Examples of experiential learning methods used include:

*[[Active-based learning]] – All participants in the group must engage actively in working together toward the stated objectives.
*[[Place-based learning]] – The process of using local community and environment as a starting point to teach concepts in language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, and other subjects across the curriculum.
*[[Problem-based learning]] – Provides a structure for discovery that helps students internalize learning and leads to greater comprehension.
*[[Project-based learning]] – An instructional method that uses projects as the central focus of instruction in a variety of disciplines.
*[[Service-learning]] – Providing meaningful service to a community agency or organization while simultaneously gaining new skills, knowledge and understanding as an integrated aspect of an academic program.
*[[Simulation-based learning]] – A combination of active, problem, project, and place-based learning; Participants are placed in a simulated environment and given objectives requiring constant attention and care.

All of these use the pattern of problem, plan, test and reflect as their foundation for the educative experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6914">'''First Principles of Instruction''', created by [[M. David Merrill]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Emeritus]] at [[Utah State University]], is an [[instructional theory]] based on a broad review of many instructional models and theories.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2002). First principles of instruction. Educational Technology Research and Development, 50(3), 43-59. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/firstprinciplesbymerrill.pdf (Click for copy from Dr. Merrill's personal website)]
&lt;/ref&gt; First Principles of Instruction are created with the goal of establishing a set of principles upon which all instructional theories and models are in general agreement, and several authors acknowledge the fundamental nature of these principles.&lt;ref&gt;Instructional-Design Theories and Models, Volume III: Building a Common Knowledge Base [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780805864564/ (link to book site)]&lt;/ref&gt; These principles can be used to assist teachers, trainers and instructional designers in developing research-based [[instructional materials]] in a manner that is likely to produce positive student learning gains.

==The Principles==
First Principles of Instruction are described as a set of interrelated principles which, when properly applied in an instructional product or setting, will increase student learning. These principles include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2009). First Principles of Instruction. In C. M. Reigeluth &amp; A. Carr (Eds.), Instructional Design Theories and Models: Building a Common Knowledge Base (Vol. III). New York: Routledge Publishers. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/FirstPrinciplesReigeluthCarr.pdf (Click for copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2007). First principles of instruction: a synthesis. In R. A. Reiser &amp; J. V. Dempsey (Eds.), Trends and Issues in Instructional Design and Technology, 2nd Edition (Vol. 2, pp. 62-71). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill/Prentice Hall. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/FirstPrinciplesSynthesis.pdf (Click for copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Task/Problem-Centered''' – Students learn more when the instruction is centered on relevant real-world tasks or problems, including a series of tasks or problems that progress from simple to complex.
* '''Activation''' – Students learn more when they are directed to recall prior knowledge, to recall a structure for organizing that knowledge, or are given a structure for organizing new knowledge. This activation can also include a foundational learning experience upon which new learning can be based.
* '''Demonstration''' – Students learn more when new knowledge is demonstrated to them in the context of real-world tasks or problems. The knowledge that is demonstrated is both informational and skill-based. Demonstration is enhanced when it adheres to research-based principles of e-learning.
* '''Application''' – Students learn more when they perform real-world tasks or solve real-world problems and receive feedback and appropriate guidance during that application.
* '''Integration''' – Students learn more when they are encouraged to integrate their new knowledge into their life through reflection, discussion, debate, and/or presentation of new knowledge.

These principles can be used in a Task or Problem-Centered cycle of instruction beginning with Activation and continuing through Demonstration, Application, and Integration.

First Principles of Instruction is similar to other task-centered instructional theories (e.g. Van Merriënboer’s Four Component Instructional Design Model&lt;ref&gt;van Merriënboer, J. J. G., Clark, R. E., and de Croock, M. B. M. (2002a). Blueprints for complex
learning: The 4C/ID-model. Educ. Technol., Res. Dev. 50(2): 39–64.&lt;/ref&gt;) in that it uses a real-world problem or task as a vehicle for instruction. Students view demonstrations of real-world problem solving examples, are given opportunities to solve real-world problems and are given feedback on their application. Students are taught new knowledge and information within the context of the real-world task or problem, which provides a context in which the knowledge is obtained. First Principles is different than problem-based-learning, however, in that it provides more guidance and demonstration to students which is reduced as students gain expertise.

==Research support==
There is a growing body of research support for Merrill's First Principles of Instruction. In one study, researchers surveyed 140 students at 89 different higher education institutions and discovered that students were 9 times more likely to report that they had mastered learning the course objectives when First Principles of Instruction were used and when they spent ample time and effort studying.&lt;ref&gt;Frick, T., Chadha, R., Watson, C., Wang, Y., &amp; Green, P. (2007). Theory-based course evaluation: Nine Scales for measuring teaching and learning quality. Retrieved from http://www.indiana.edu/~tedfrick/TALQ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another study observed award-winning instructors at an institute of higher education and found that they used some or all of First Principles of Instruction in their teaching strategies, thereby linking acclaimed instructors with the principles.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, J., (2011). How Award-winning Professors in Higher Education Use Merrill's First Principles of Instruction. International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 8(5), p. 3-16).[http://www.itdl.org/Journal/May_11/May_11.pdf (link to article)]&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, researchers compared the effectiveness of instruction using First Principles of Instruction with more traditional instruction and found that students in the First Principles group learned significantly more and finished learning tasks significantly faster.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson. (2002). Thomson job impact study: The next generation of learning [electronic version]. Retrieved from http://www.delmarlearning.com/resources/job_impact_study_whitepaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that biology students learning from instruction using First Principles of Instruction had significantly increased confidence in their ability to solve similar problems in the future, compared to other learners.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Joel.

:''For the American spy, see [[Frederick Mayer (spy)]]''
[[Image:Frederick mayer memory.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Mayer]] '''Frederick Mayer''' (11 August 1921, [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] - 26 June 2006, [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) was an educational scientist and philosopher of the [[University of Redlands]], [[California]] and one of the leading [[creativity]] experts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} One of his most important aims was a global humanism. Until the very last days of his life he was active as an author. More than sixty books deal with creativity, education and humanism. Internationally recognized creativity researcher Frederick Mayer in Vienna died. Mayer was particularly affected by the quote "Pride is not for him who loves his country, but for him who loves the whole world."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7099">The '''Gifted Rating Scale''' (GRS) is a scholastic assessment for school children.  It is used mostly for Gifted &amp; Talented admissions.  It is administered by a teacher who knows the child well.  The teacher rates specific gifted behaviors that they have observed over time.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer" /&gt;

==History==
[[Rating scale]]s have developed since the early 1970s to assess general child [[psychometrics]] and [[psychopathology]].

The Gifted Rating Scales, first published in 2003, are authored by Steven Ira Pfeiffer, PhD (1950-), and Tania Jarosewich, PhD. The GRS is completed through teacher evaluations and measures giftedness on multiple scales.

The GRS-P, designed for children in preschool and kindergarten, evaluates children on five scales:

#Intellectual ability
#Academic ability
#Creativity
#Artistic talent
#Motivation

The GRS-S, designed for children in grades 1-8, evaluates giftedness in children on six scales:

#Intellectual ability
#Academic ability
#Creativity
#Artistic talent
#Leadership ability
#Motivation

Notwithstanding skepticism &amp;mdash; that laypeople lack expertise, objectivity, and consistency to administer the GRS &amp;mdash; Harbrace contends that the GRS, by design, allows for minimal observational bias and a high degree of measurement accuracy, especially at higher levels.

One of the best advantages of using the GRS, as compared to interviews, is that it is easy to administer and less expensive than traditional large-scale testing.  Time for administration is usually modest.  Rater bias and subjectivity of responding can be reduced by using a standardized presentation of questions, though this has yet to be researched.  The GRS can be routinely administered in schools.  While the GRS itself is fairly new, rating scales tend to have good data on reliability and validity.

GRS validation studies have been accepted for publication in journals including Gifted Child Quarterly, which has accepted three GRS validity studies, the Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment and the Roeper Review. It is important to note that research on the topic of the GRS has been published by the authors of the GRS, or one of their current or former students. Interested persons should consult the Buros Mental Measurement Yearbook review of the GRS for additional information on this and other rating scales. 

[[Harcourt Assessment]], Inc. is a unit of [[Harcourt Education]], which is part of [[Reed Elsevier|Reed Elsevier Group plc.]]

==Criticisms==
The GRS as a rating scale has yet to be evaluated up to the level commonly accepted by major research associations (NCTM, AERA, APA). As such its use in gifted and talented identification at this point is questionable. Although the GRS is among the top-tier of such rating scales meant to be used for gifted and talented identification, it is also by far the most expensive. 

The GRS assessment is controversial because, among other things, intellectually gifted children at the highest levels are often ''not'' "teacher pleasers" and can be misunderstood or evaluated with prejudice, especially by laypeople with no expertise in giftedness.  Moreover, raters can't access, guess, or factor for certain likable or unlikable characteristics such as hyperactivity or inattention or aggressive/stubbornness. 

Rating scales, in general, can be subject to rater bias based upon the characteristics of the rater.  This is of particular concern for children being evaluated for kindergarten because the credentials of the raters from preschools greatly vary.  Slight changes in the wording of instructions, or the wording of the items themselves, may have a significant effect on the child's response.

Data obtained from ratings rely totally on the rater's familiarity with the child.  In practice, the rater of a preschooler, for example, may not be the same person that spends time with the child.

Rating scales, in general, are limited to the informant's perspective.  Information that may be relevant to the subject, but that is not covered by the items of the scale will be missed.  With rating scales, it is not possible to explore the informant's responses and subjective experiences, nor is it possible to observe behavior directly.

Because the GRS is administered by laypeople, critics aver that in a large school system, such as New York City, problems with measurement consistency can be tolerably contained within Regions; but it can be injurious to students wrongly admitted to more rigorous citywide schools for intellectually gifted.

In the case of the New York City public schools, the implementation of the GRS and the OLSAT, together, essentially represent a shift away from using [[IQ]] as the prime criteria for identifying special needs.  It also removes the assessment duties from the erstwhile used tightly-controlled NYC DOE process that uses pre-approved, independent child psychologists (who had, until 2007, administered the [[Stanford Binet]]), and gives most of the duties, instead, to a [[publishing industry|publishing company]] and laypeople.&lt;ref name="NYTs 2006" /&gt;

IQ in the top 5% is difficult to ''accurately'' measure.  The GRS is too new to have been adequately normed for acceptable accuracy at those levels.

Criteria, such as Leadership and Motivation, are often counter-correlated with high IQ, so the GRS might actually screen out children who most need special attention.

== Use of GRS in public education ==
* '''2007-08 New York City Department of Education''' adopted the use of GRS as a one-third component for gaining admission to pre-K through 3 Gifted &amp; Talented programs.  The other two-thirds component was the OLSAT.  This was the only year that the GRS was used. Beginning 2008-09, the DOE replaced the GRS with Bracken School Readiness Assessment and changed the BSRA/OLSAT weighting to 25/75.
* '''2011-12 Atlanta Public School System''' adopted the use of GRS as a pre-qualitifiying process for automatic testing of students for the Gifted &amp; Talented programs.

[[File:Harkness-method.jpg|thumbnail|Instructor and students at Techie Youth, engaged in the Harkness discussion-based teaching method]]
[[File:College Prep Harkness Table.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Students and instructor seated around a Harkness table at [[The College Preparatory School]] in Oakland, California]]
The '''Harkness table''', '''Harkness method''', or '''Harkness discussion''' is a teaching and learning method involving students seated in a large, oval configuration to discuss ideas in an encouraging, open-minded environment with only occasional or minimal teacher intervention.

==Overview==
Harkness method is in use at many American [[boarding school]]s and colleges and encourages classes to be held in a discursive manner. The style is related to the [[Socratic method]]. Developed at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazing Harkness Philosophy|url=http://www.exeter.edu/admissions/109_1220.aspx|work=Phillips Exeter Academy|accessdate=2011-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the method's name comes from the oil magnate and [[philanthropist]] [[Edward Harkness]], a graduate of [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], who presented the school with a monetary gift in 1930. It has been adopted in numerous schools, where small class-size makes it effective, but it remains impractical for larger classes.  There are also downsides for students who are not good in taking notes. They must first learn the strategies in proper note-taking in the classroom.   Harkness described its use as follows:

:''What I have in mind is [a classroom] where [students] could sit around a table with a teacher who would talk with them and instruct them by a sort of tutorial or conference method, where [each student] would feel encouraged to speak up. This would be a real revolution in methods.''&lt;ref&gt;Christophe G. Courchesne, [http://lawrecord.typepad.com/rutgers_law_record/files/29rlr21.pdf "'A Suggestion of a Fundamental Nature': Imagining a Legal Education of Solely Electives Taught as Discussions"], ''Rutgers Law Record'' 29, no. 21 (2005): 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harkness learning can vary, most notably between humanities subjects such as English and history and technical subjects such as math or physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.exeter.edu/exeter-difference/how-youll-learn|title=How You'll Learn|website=Phillips Exeter Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are general principles and goals, however, that go along with that method regardless of subject matter. The main goal is to encourage students to come up with ideas of their own and learn good reasoning and discussion skills. Depending on style, the teacher may interact very little, interjecting only to guide the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/progressive-education-how-children-learn-today-2774713|title=Progressive Education - How Children Learn|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whole Group Discussion Method ===
The Whole Group Discussion Technique follows the Harkness Method. It involves interaction throughout the class instead of the teacher simply delivering a lecture with students listening.  Many teachers today prefer this approach because of heightened communication between the mentor and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/whole-group-discussion-pros-and-cons-8036|title=The Pros and Cons of Whole Group Discussion|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are advantages and disadvantages in using this method. Auditory learners find this style more interesting. They are able to keep information completely since sounds reinforce the information. This process includes use of musical notes, memorization of lists, voice recordings, and chants for memorizing history terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/auditory-learning-style-1857081|title=Understanding the Auditory Learning Style|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers are able to check what students retain through questioning. Students can concentrate on their lessons and feel more at ease in asking questions during discussions.

However, the Whole Group Discussion approach calls for effective classroom management by teachers. Otherwise, it may be too disturbing for them to implement ground rules for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edglossary.org/classroom-management/|title=Classroom Management Definition|last=Partnership|first=Great Schools|date=2013-05-15|work=The Glossary of Education Reform|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also downsides for students who are not good in taking notes. They must first learn the strategies in proper note-taking in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oxfordlearning.com/5-effective-note-taking-methods/|title=How To Take Study Notes: 5 Effective Note Taking Methods|date=2017-05-03|work=Oxford Learning|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are strategies in effective implementation of Whole Group Discussions. The Think-Pair-Share is commonly used for lower elementary pupils to persuade the children in acquiring listening and speaking skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adlit.org/strategies/23277/|title=Think-Pair-Share {{!}} Classroom Strategies {{!}} AdLit.org|website=www.adlit.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical Chairs is another strategy wherein teachers read sentences or topics with only two likely responses. It is either agree or disagree. Each group of students defends the position it adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/lesson-plans/teaching-content/philosophical-chairs-discussion/|title=Philosophical Chairs Discussion {{!}} Scholastic|website=www.scholastic.com|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishbowl is one of the most popular classroom discussion techniques. A group of two up to four students sit facing one another at the center of the classroom. The other students sit around their peers. Those at the middle discuss the selected subject matter or question while the others take notes related to the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/evaluation-options/fishbowltechnique|title=Fishbowl Technique {{!}} Better Evaluation|website=www.betterevaluation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other strategies include Concentric Circles Strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learningstrategieseng491.weebly.com/concentric-circles.html|title=Concentric Circles|website=Learning Strategies For ELL's|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery Walk,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theteachertoolkit.com/index.php/tool/gallery-walk|title=Gallery Walk - The Teacher Toolkit|website=www.theteachertoolkit.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyramid Strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.educationcorner.com/the-learning-pyramid.html|title=The Learning Pyramid|website=www.educationcorner.com|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carousel Walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://shelleygrayteaching.com/carousel/|title=How To Use the Cooperative Learning "Carousel" Strategy|date=2016-05-12|work=Shelley Gray|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humane education''' is usually defined as the use of education to nurture compassion and respect for living beings.&lt;ref name = "Unti &amp; DeRosa, 2003"&gt;Unti, B. &amp; DeRosa, B. (2003). Humane education: Past, present, and future. In D. J. Salem &amp; A. N. Rowam (Eds.), ''The State of the Animals II: 2003'' (pp. 27 – 50). Washington, D.C.: Humane Society Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faver, C. A. (2010). School-based humane education as a strategy to prevent violence: Review and recommendations. ''Children &amp; Youth Services Review'', ''32'', 365 – 370.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a traditional focus on the treatment of non-human animals, humane education also increasingly contains content related to the environment, the compassionate treatment of other people, and the interconnectedness of issues pertaining to people and the planet.&lt;ref name = "Burnett, 2000"&gt;Burnett, C. (2000). Humane education. ''Animals Today'', ''8'', 18 - 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Humane education as a discrete field of education was created in the late 1800s by individuals like [[George Angell]] as an attempt to prevent cruelty to animals before it started&lt;ref name = "Preston, 1928"&gt;Preston, H. C. (1928). Milestones in humane education. ''Journal of Education'', ''107'', 181.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the formation of SPCAs, such as the [[MSPCA-Angell|Massachusetts SCPA]] and the [[ASPCA]]. The formation of humane education and animal protection/welfare organizations was associated with the expansion of [[women’s suffrage]] and the [[temperance movement]], and many of those involved in creation and early advocacy of humane education also worked in those other areas of social change as well.&lt;ref name = "Burnett, 2000" /&gt; These early activists successfully advocated for the passage of laws supporting or even requiring the teaching of humane education in schools,&lt;ref name = "Preston, 1928" /&gt; and many teachers did teach it.&lt;ref&gt;Morrill, W. M. (Nov. 11, 1920). Humane education and the teacher. ''Journal of Education'','' 100''(2), 462.&lt;/ref&gt;  The animal welfare organizations also visited schools and other youth centers to teach “push-in” programs that supplemented—and possibly augmented—the children’s other education.

In addition to school-based programs and activities, humane education was initially conducted as well through [[Bands of Mercy]]; although these have been disbanded, humane education continues to be conducted in community-based settings.  These include animal shelters, humane education centers and parks as well as, e.g., [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Clubs]], [[YWCA]]s and [[YMCA]]s, cultural and religious centers, etc.

Currently, humane education is primarily conducted by animal welfare organizations—and organizations that include humane education among their primary focuses—such as the [https://www.latham.org/ Latham Foundation], the Association of Professional Humane Educators ([Association of Professional Humane Educators|APHE]), International Network for Humane Education ([[InterNICHE]]), and [https://www.actasia.org/ ACTAsia].&lt;ref name = "Unti &amp; DeRosa, 2003" /&gt;

==General Goals, Content, and Pedagogical Strategies==
Humane education often looks to help the compassion and concern that children and adolescents have towards one group be extended to other groups. One of the beliefs that helped establish humane education as a field has been that helping children learn to treat animals with kindness will encourage them to grow up to be adults who are kind to all animals, human and non-human.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, K. L. &amp; Gullone, E. (2003). Promotion of empathy and prosocial behaviour in children through humane education. ''Australian Psychologist'', ''38'', 175 – 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  This “cross-fertilization” of kindness is also used, e.g., to try to have the care that children have for their own pets be extended to animals in their community, animals in circuses and zoos, animals in agriculture and on [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]], or to show how reducing pollution in one’s neighborhood can help ecosystems far away.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, W. E. (2007). Humane education: How to nurture empathy in children. ''Encyclopædia of Human-Animal Relationships: A Global Exploration of Our Connections with Animals'' (pp. 680 – 683), M. Bekoff and J. Nystrom (Eds.), Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical Current Content===
In addition to the humane treatment of domestic animals, humane education now often examines broader issues including human relationships and animal exploitation. Common topics currently covered include responsible pet care (e.g., spaying/neutering and responsible adoption); animal agriculture; factory farming; captive wild animals; understanding animal emotions, sentience, and communication; blood sports; bite prevention; ecological stewardship; the interconnectedness of life; pollution; reduction/reuse/recycling of materials; bullying; non-violent conflict resolution; critical thinking, child labor; and the effects of every-day activities on other people, animals, and the environment.

===Pedagogical Strategies===
Since the beginning, humane education has focused on what is now often called [[service-learning]] and [[experiential learning]].&lt;ref name = "Unti &amp; DeRosa, 2003" /&gt; Organizations that conduct humane education programs, therefore, often create community- or home-based activities in which students can learn humane education content and behaviors through experience and reflection.

Humane education programs may be conducted in a variety of ways in schools. Programs may be supplemental or add-on programs such as when a humane educator or the teacher of record will devote a class period to humane education content; in these cases, the lesson is often devoted wholly to teach humane education content (e.g., responsible pet or environmental care, spaying/neutering, respect for others). Programs may also be infused into the curriculum or add-ins. These infused programs allow for the most effective form of Humane Pedagogy (a teaching approach inspired by Critical Pedagogy, which attempts to help students activate cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains of learning and determine personal values.) &lt;ref name=rename3&gt;Itle-Clark, S. (2013).Inservice teachers' understanding and teaching of humane education before and after a standards-based intervention. Dissertation. Fielding Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest humane pedagogy is part of both the written and unwritten curriculum.

Humane education may also be integrated into traditional lessons. Since most children and adolescents find animals and nature to be engaging topics, humane education can be an effective vehicle to also teach other content, such as literature, history, civics, or science.

==Effectiveness==
Although teachers who use humane education often report ancedotal evidence that it works, and although there is a welter of qualitative research that also suggests it is effetive, there are few objective, well-controlled studies that compare humane education programs against good control groups. Nonetheless, those few studies that do study it carefully tend to find that it is effective---probably at least as effective as other, comparable non-humane education programs.

===Animal-Assisted Education===
Animal-assisted education is education that is employs direct interaction/perception of animals to enhance learning. One such program, studied by Julie Sprinkle&lt;ref&gt;Sprinkle, J. E. (2008). Animals, empathy, and violence: Can animals be used to convey principles of prosocial behavior to children? ''Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice'', ''6'', 47-58&lt;/ref&gt;, used shelter dogs in a school-based violence prevention and character education program. According to the researcher, "[f]indings indicate that receiving the program significantly alters students’ normative beliefs about aggression, levels of empathy, and displays of violent and aggressive behaviors."

===Push-in Programs===
Probably the [https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1Xbqx38nswP8OH largest study of humane education ever conducted]&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, W. E. (2018). Nurturing kindness naturally: A humane education program’s effect on the prosocial behavior of first and second graders across China. ''International Journal of Educational Research'', ''91'', 49 – 64. doi: 10.1016/j.ijer.2018.08.001.&lt;/ref&gt; included a "large evaluation conducted over 3 separate years in 25 public elementary schools in 5 cities across eastern China". The author randomly assigned about half of the schools to participate in Caring-for-Life, a humane education program, and randomly assigned the other half to the control group. In all, the effect of the program was tested on over 2,000 first and second grade students. Te author reports that "[s]tudents who participated in the program displayed significantly greater gains in [[Prosociality|prosociality]] than similar students who didn’t. Students who participated in an expanded version of the program appeared to realize even greater gains".

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08927936.2016.1228751 Another experimental-vs-control study]&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Samuels, L. Meers, S. Normando (2016). Improving upper elementary students’ humane attitudes and prosocial behaviors through an in-class humane education program, ''Anthrozoös'', ''29''(4) pp. 597-610, doi: 10.1080/08927936.2016.1228751&lt;/ref&gt; compared the effect of the Roots and Shoots humane education program on elementary students in several schools in two cities in the United States. The authors found that "[s]tudents who participated in the humane education program showed stronger growth in both of these outcomes compared with students in the control group". However, they did not find differences in disruptive behaviors between students who participated in the humane education program and the control program (a chess club). Overall, the authors state that "[e]ffects appeared strongest on attitudes; behavioral effects were found to be largely limited to behaviors directly addressed by the humane education program".

===Duration of Effects===
The effects of a humane education program seem to last for at least a year. Piek and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Piek, R. Kane, D. Rigoli, S. Mclaren, C.M. Roberts, R. Rooney, L. Straker (2015). Does the Animal Fun program improve social-emotional and behavioural outcomes in children aged 4–6 years? ''Human Movement Science'', ''43'', 155-163&lt;/ref&gt; found that young children randomly assigned to participate in the Animal Fun program, which "was designed to enhance motor and social development in young children" showed significant improvements in teacher-rated prosocial behaviour and total difficulties compared to children randomly assigned to the control group. The effect of the program was found to still be strong not only 6 months but also 12 and 18 months later. As the authors states, "The Animal Fun program appears to be effective in improving social and behavioural outcomes".

'''Intercultural communicative competence in computer-supported collaborative learning''' is the application of [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL) to provide intercultural communicative competence (ICC).

==Essential ideas connecting CSCL and ICC==
One of the well-known applications of [[Computer-supported collaborative learning|CSCL]] is telecollaboration involving the use of the Internet or other [[computer-mediated communication]] tools by internationally dispersed students in order to foster the development of foreign language linguistic and [[intercultural competence]] in communication.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, J. (2003). Linguistic perspectives on the development of intercultural competence in telecollaboration. ''Language Learning &amp;amp; Technology'', ''7''(2), 68–117.&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of the technological mediation used in telecollaborative study, participants on each side of the network have cost-effective access to "[[Languaculture]]."

Numerous models and theories of [[intercultural communication]] have been proposed, including [[communication accommodation]] (Giles, 1973), cultural convergence (Barnett &amp; [[D. Lawrence Kincaid|Kincaid]], 1983), identity or [[face negotiation theory]] (Ting-Toomey, 1993), and [[interactive acculturation]] (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, &amp; Senecal, 1997). A model of ICC (or IC) widely accepted in foreign language education has been proposed by Byram.&lt;ref&gt;Byram, M. (1997). Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence. Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; This model includes five components, all of which are needed for a student to become an "intercultural speaker":

# attitudes: ''curiosity and openness, readiness to suspend disbelief about other cultures and belief about one's own.''
# knowledge: ''of social group and their products and practices in one's own and in one's interlocutor's country, and one of the general processes of societal and individual interaction.''
# skills of interpreting and relating: ''ability to interpret a document or event from another culture, to explain it and relate it to documents from one's own.''
# skills of discovery and interaction: ''ability to acquire new knowledge of a culture and cultural practices and the ability to operate knowledge, attitudes and skills under the constraints of real-time communication and interaction.''
# critical awareness or an evaluative orientation: ''an ability to evaluate critically and on the basis of explicit criteria perspectives, practices and products in one's own and other cultures and countries.''

==CSCL affordances&lt;!-- what is this supposed to mean? --&gt; for ICC==
The benefits as well as the challenges of utilizing CSCL as a means of intercultural communication must be considered. Research in the field indicates several advantages, including:

* Helps build [[Negotiation#The pervasive impact of culture on international negotiations.5B26.5D|negotiation]] strategies&lt;ref&gt;Belz, J. &amp;amp; Muller-Hartmann, A. (2003).

==Challenges for ICC within CSCL environments==
However, despite the potential advantages of using CSCL to overcome the barriers of face-to-face prejudice, develop social skills, and increase cognitive flexibility, simply adding CSCL to a communicative situation does not automatically foster [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] nor resolve intercultural issues. In fact, research has indicated that some problems are made worse (or at least more obvious) by moving to a computer-supported medium:

* Face-to-face conversations always ebb and flow, but in the CSCL world, this ebb and flow can be misinterpreted, depending on the intercultural context, as boredom or even anger.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even in a synchronous CSCL environment, people are often not as fully engaged because of physical isolation; consistent and constant clarification of meaning, similar to the interactive process of [[semantic interoperability]] in computer systems, is necessary, a requirement which prolongs tasks and projects.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, T. (1997). Social interaction and the new media: The construction of communicative contexts. ''Nordicom Review'', ''2'', 63–75. Retrieved from [http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/5_001_012.pdf http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/5_001_012.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* CSCL affords many choices among tools: from asynchronous email and discussion boards to synchronous chat and VoIP to visually present web cams and virtual worlds. However, when intercultural differences are considered, the tools are less interchangeable, and thus tool selection is more constrained.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008). Discourse-based technology support for intercultural communication in multinationals. ''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Misunderstandings, including those which arise from intercultural differences, are not recognized (and cleared up) as quickly in CSCL environments.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Success depends on people feeling part of the group; bonding and [[interpersonal ties]] are more difficult to achieve at a distance, particularly with abstract and lengthy messages, which may be appropriate in some cultures but inappropriate in others.&lt;ref&gt;Wegeriff, R. (1998). The social dimensions of asynchronous learning networks. ''Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks'', ''2''(1), 34–49.

* Success depends on trust-building which is difficult to achieve in a computer-mediated environment which may be conducive only to selected intercultural contexts (for example, lack of self-disclosure is viewed as a positive trait in some cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because cultural preferences for activity, structure, and style vary among cultures, the creation of learning events requires careful consideration and additional design time on the part of the instructor.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008). Discourse-based technology support for intercultural communication in multinationals. ''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

* Without a facilitator to invigorate conversations and engage participants, communication is likely to decrease in CSCL environments due to the extra effort and extended timeframe required by the additional layer of intercultural communication.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, T.

==Pedagogical implications and suggestions for implementation==
Although there are many benefits to using CSCL, especially in language learning contexts, teachers must approach its adoption with clear goals and objectives. Teachers should select the CSCL [[Medium (communication)|medium]] with careful consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008).

''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning#Available Tools|tool]] selection is critical since different media work well for some people and not for others.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, instructors need to be familiar with concepts of intercultural communication in addition to CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;Joia, L. (2002). Analysing a web-based e-commerce learning community: A case study in Brazil. ''Internet Research'', ''12''(4), 305–317.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of its application CSCL is not appropriate for short-term projects,&lt;ref&gt;Veermans, M. &amp;amp; Cesareni, D. (2005).

''Computers &amp;amp; Education'', ''45''(3), 316–336.&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers should expect to spend a considerable amount of extra management time in roles such as mediators, monitors, and facilitators.&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006). Strategies to build a cross-national virtual world. ''AACE Journal'', ''14''(2), 103–128.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers who have little extra time should not implement CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006).

R. (2005). Negotiating sociocultural and institutional contexts: The case of Spanish-American telecollaboration. ''Language and Intercultural Communication'', ''5''(1), 40–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these challenges, CSCL may prove to be a superior tool through which teachers can foster greater understanding between their students and members of other cultures.

'''Inventive spelling''' (sometimes ''invented spelling'')  is the use of [[Convention (norm)|unconventional]] [[spelling]]s of words.

Conventional written English is not [[Phonemic orthography|phonetic]] (that is, it is not written as it sounds, due to the [[English orthography#History|history of its spelling]], which led to outdated, unintuitive, misleading or arbitrary spelling conventions and spellings of individual words) unlike, for example, [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], where letters have relatively fixed associated sounds, so that the written text is a fair representation of the spoken words.

== Overview ==
[[English orthography|English spelling]] is not intuitive and must be learned.  There have been numerous proposals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyrdplay.org/reform1.html|title=English Spelling Reform|author1=Alan Beale |author2=Paul Stought |author3=Bob Boden |publisher=Wyrdplay org|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rationalize written English, notably by 
* [[Noah Webster]] in the early 19th century (which is why the [[Webster's Dictionary]] used in the USA varies from the British [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) 
* Sir [[Isaac Pitman]], inventor of [[Pitman shorthand]] about 1838, which uses symbols to represent sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken
* Dr. [[John R. Malone]] invented [[Unifon]] in the mid-1950s 
* Sir [[James Pitman]] (the grandson of Sir Isaac) in the early 1960s developed the [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]]
* Jaber Jabbour in 2012 proposed [[SaypU]], an abbreviated version of the International Phonetic Alphabet adapted for tourism and safety notices, which uses only part of the [[Latin alphabet]]

==In education==
Inventive spelling for children may be encouraged or discouraged by teachers and parents who may believe that expression is more important than accurate orthography or conversely that a failure to correct may lead to difficulty in communicating more complex ideas in later life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Inventive spelling programs may also be known as "words their way" in some schools' curricula.&lt;ref name="Amazon-7770856"&gt;{{cite book |title=Words Their Way: Word Study for Phonics, Vocabulary, and Spelling Instruction |isbn=978-0-13-223968-4 |date=May 21, 2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=4  |first1=Donald R. |last1=Bear |first2=Marcia |last2=Invernizzi |first3=Shane |last3=Templeton |first4=Francine |last4=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics of inventive spelling {{Who|date=December 2017}} have argued that inventive spelling does not produce superior writing skills.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Debate over inventive or invented spelling ===
Samuel Orton pioneered the study of learning disabilities, such as [[dyslexia]]. where the subject is apt to confound the letter-order of words. He and  his assistant [[Anna Gillingham]], an educator and psychologist, evolved the [[Orton-Gillingham]] Approach to reading instruction which is language-based, multi-sensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, cognitive, and flexible. The Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators (AOEPE) lists about a dozen schools currently committed to this controversial method, which has evolved since about 1935.

More recently, [[Uta Frith]], a developmental psychologist at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College, London, has published work concerning spelling difficulties and dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frith, Uta |title=Cognitive Processes in Spelling |publisher=Academic Press |location=London, UK |year=1983|isbn=0-12-268662-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyslexia, whether linked to complex spelling or not, may offer considerable potential for human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dyslexic Advantage: Unlocking the Hidden Potential of the Dyslexic Brain|author=Brock L. Eide M.D. M.A. |publisher=Penguin USA/Plume|year=2011|isbn=978-0-452-29792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gift of Dyslexia|publisher=Penguin USA/Perigee|year=1999|isbn=978-0-399-53566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning theory===

Whether an individual accepts or rejects inventive spelling is a feature of that individual's [[epistemology|theory of learning]]. The debate is closely linked with the debate over [[whole language]] [[literacy]] instruction and [[phonics]] instruction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Theories of supporters====
Those who favor inventive spelling tend to believe in [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], a theoretical perspective on learning (an [[epistemology]]) grounded in [[postmodernism]] and [[holism]].  Constructivists believe that knowledge is created by individuals in a social context.  Because knowledge is cultural, there are no right answers.  In terms of inventive spelling, constructivists are likely to believe that the child is inventing spellings in accord with his or her understanding of language and print.  These spellings are neither right nor wrong; they reflect the child's development as a speller.

====Theories of detractors====
Those who oppose inventive spelling tend to be [[positivism|positivists]] or [[postpositivism|post-positivists]]. Positivists believe that there are correct answers that we can discover based upon [[empirical]] observation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} They would argue that encouraging inventive spelling is not helpful because there are correct ways to spell that children should learn.

Post-positivists believe that while we cannot know truth completely – our own biases and perspectives prevent that – we can ''approximate'' truth.  Post-positivists might agree with constructivists that an inventive spelling does reflect a child's development but might also argue that there are socially accepted spellings and that children should know these well. This side of the debate was explored further in the book and short film "The deliberate [[dumbing down]] of America".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
&lt;!-- This section and possibly this entire article uses weasel words and is in dire need of citations. --&gt;

====State of the debate====
Advocates of inventive spelling focus on creativity when children are first learning to spell and write, feel this preserves self-esteem, and thus, feel creativity in spelling is most important.&lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, H./ Brinkmann, E. (2012): Supporting individual routes to literacy: Developing concepts and skills before school  by using print in meaningful contexts. Download: https://www.academia.edu/4274843/Supporting_individual_routes_to_literacy_Developing_concepts_and_skills_before_school_by_using_print_in_meaningful_contexts; Ferreiro, E./ Teberosky, A. (1982): Literacy before schooling. Heinemann: Portsmouth/ London (span. 1979); McGee, L.M., &amp; Richgels, D. J. (2012): Literacy's beginnings: Supporting young readers and writers. Pearson/ Allyn and Bacon: Boston et al. (6th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents counter that creativity is a distraction when learning spelling for the first time, and that children ought to be taught accurate spelling as soon as possible so as not to have incorrect spellings become a habit and delay the learning of accurate spelling.  The overwhelming view from parents {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} is that children learn to spell more quickly and accurately if accurate spelling is the focus instead of creativity when learning words.  Accuracy as the focus in spelling is the manner used in conventional teaching methods and was effectively universal prior to the implementation of 1970s school reform involving whole word literacy and "new math". &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Instruction===

====Inventive spelling instruction====
Pedagogical concepts &lt;ref&gt;e.g. by Brügelmann, H. (1986). ''Discovering print – a process approach to initial reading and writing in West Germany''. In: The Reading Teacher, Vol. 40, No. 3, 294–298; McGee, L. M./ Richgels, D. J. (2000). ''Literacy's beginnings: Supporting young readers and writers.'' Boston: Allyn and Bacon (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  are based on research studies of early literacy, e.g. by  Emilia Ferreiro &amp; Ana Teberosky, Maryann Manning and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreiro, E./ Teberosky, A. (1982). ''Literacy before schooling''. Portsmouth/ London: Heinemann (span. 1979); Henderson, E. H./ Beers, J. W. (eds.) (1980). ''Developmental and cognitive aspects of learning to spell: A reflection of word knowledge''. Newark, Del.:  International Reading Association;  Clarke, L.K. (1988). ''Invented vs. traditional spelling in first graders' writings: Effects on learning to spell and read''. In: Research in the Teaching of English, Vol. 22, No. 3 (October), 281–309.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are encouraged to learn to read by writing in a meaningful context, e.g. by writing letters to others. To write a word they have to decompose its spoken form into sounds and then to translate them into letters, e.g. ''k'', ''a'', ''t'' for the [[phonemes]] /k/, /æ/, and /t/. Empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, H. (1999). ''From invention to convention. Children's different routes to literacy. How to teach reading and writing by construction vs. instruction.'' In: Nunes, T. (ed.) (1999). ''Learning to read: An integrated view from research and practice.'' Dordrecht et al.: Kluwer(315–342); Richgels, D.J. (2001). ''Invented spelling, phonemic awareness, and reading and writing instruction.'' In: Neuman, S. B./ Dickinson, D. (eds.) (2001). ''Handbook on Research in Early Literacy for the 21st Century.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; show that later orthographic development is fostered rather than hindered by these invented spellings - as long as children from the beginning are confronted with "book spellings", too.

To use [[SIL International]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/ www.sil.org]&lt;/ref&gt; inventive spelling program, there are several instructional principles, as follows: 
* At first, the teachers should accept all of the student's writing as meaningful writing. As students gain more experience, they begin to learn the correct spellings of words and use these spellings in their writings.
* Let the students write freely and independently.
* Ask students to read what they have written.
* Read the text, or repeat the story as if you are reading it.
* Ignore spelling and [[grammar]] errors, unless the students ask to be corrected.
* Rewrite the text if students want you to.
* Help the students to create their own word lists as they write or edit so they can find out the proper spellings.

One aspect of inventive spelling rarely discussed by its advocates is the toll it takes on teachers' time.  Recent studies suggest that to be effective a spelling teacher also must correctly guess what words children meant to use when they invent spellings. The possible deductions are numerous and potentially complicated.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

====Instruction for conventional spelling====

[[Writing]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]] are complex cognitive processes of encoding and decoding symbols, of which spelling forms only part.  [[Flashcard|"Look and say"]] form an image of a word without spelling.  [[Spelling#Methods used to teach and learn spelling|Spelling training]] may require children to write out lists of words repeatedly, or engage in competitive [[spelling bee]] tests. Such methods of instruction do not tend to improve students' understanding of the relationship between spelling and pronunciation on any words except those prescribed.

Instruction that emphasizes conventional spelling focuses on the [[phonics]] patterns and rules in English which are anyway intrinsically weak because of the complexity of the [[history of the English language]].  For example, children can be taught that when they hear the {{IPA|/k/}} sound at the end of a one-[[syllable]] word where a [[phonics|short vowel]] precedes the sound, the {{IPA|/k/}} sound will be spelled ''ck'' (as in ''stack'', ''wreck'', ''stick'', ''rock'', and ''stuck'').  A similar pattern holds for the {{IPA|/dʒ/}} sound spelled ''dge'' (as in ''badge'', ''wedge'', ''bridge'', ''lodge'', and ''budge'') and the {{IPA|/tʃ/}} sound spelling ''tch''.

The same is also applicable for the process of learning acronyms. It is acceptable to use the inventive spelling of GBOL or ''Jeebol'' which can in turn be written as ''Jeeball''.

Once children learn these phonics patterns, they can apply them to words.  When children make errors, the teacher does not merely tell them they are wrong; the teacher, to the extent possible, returns the child's attention to the relevant rule or pattern.

There are also [[sight word]]s that do not follow patterns; children need to memorize conventional spellings for these words, such as ''who''.

==Benefits and costs==

===Benefits===

Whether teachers encourage children to use inventive spellings or not, analyzing them has several key advantages:
* Children's invented spellings help teachers understand what students know and do not know about the phonetic structure of the language.
* Sophisticated spelling, even if it is not conventional, may indicate strong [[phonological awareness]].
* Examining invented spellings may help researchers understand the development of phonological awareness and understanding of [[sound-symbol correspondence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcrr.org/Curriculum/.../Arndt_IDA2009_StudentsasSpellers.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/winter0506/Moats.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For those teachers who emphasize constructivist, inventive spellings, there are further advantages:
* Children who are allowed to spell inventively may learn an earlier appreciation for [[writing]].
* Children who spell inventively may be more creative in their writing because they focus less on form. They may also use more complicated and precise words that occur in their oral vocabulary but that they do not yet know how to spell, helping them communicate their ideas more fully.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kappanmagazine.org/content/92/7/57.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

The above two suppositions on the benefits of inventive spelling have not been empirically verified and are not generally accepted by neurolinguists, who study the natural learning process of spoken language and have recently determined that reading and spelling are not "hard-wired", natural processes.

===Costs===
Permitting or encouraging children to spell inventively has some costs.
* According to some research, children may learn to spell correctly faster if they are taught to do so in a direct and systematic way.
* Encouraging inventive spelling may delay children's conventional spelling development.
* Early excitement about writing may give way to later frustration when students feel a lack of confidence about their misspellings.
* Some students like to spell things correctly and may resist attempts to get them to spell inventively.
* Practising bad spelling habits ingrains them and makes them difficult to overcome, while spelling correctly from the beginning eliminates this problem.

'''''Karcher v. May''''', 484 U.S. 72 (1987),&lt;ref name=decision&gt;{{ussc|name=Karcher v. May|volume=484|page=72|pin=|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[school prayer]] case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the former presiding officers of the New Jersey legislature did not have Article III [[standing (law)|standing]] to appeal a case, that standing had passed on to their legislative successors.

==Background==
In 1982, the [[New Jersey]] [[New Jersey Legislature|Legislature]] passed a statute over the governor's veto providing for a [[moment of silence]] in public schools, which failed to specifically mention [[prayer]]. May filed a lawsuit in the federal [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] challenging the constitutionality of the statute; the executive-branch officials normally tasked with defending such suits (the Governor and the Attorney General) admitted the unconstitutionality of the statute and refused to defend it in court. Consequently, [[Alan Karcher]], Speaker of the [[New Jersey General Assembly]], and [[Carmen Orechio]], President of the [[New Jersey Senate]], moved to [[intervention (law)|intervene]] (under Rule 24 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]) as defendants on behalf of the Legislature; the court granted the motion. In 1983, the District Court found that the purpose of the statute was religious, and deemed the law unconstitutional on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref name=kamen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1357500.html|title=Ruling on `Moment of Silence' Avoided; Court Also Curtails Environmental Suits Under Clean Water Act|last=Kamen|first=Al|date=December 2, 1987|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1347183.html|title=Court Hears Suit Over Schools' Moment of Silence; Questions Suggest a Definitive Ruling Is Unlikely on New Jersey Law's Constitutionality|last=Kamen|first=Al|date=October 7, 1987|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karcher and Orechio appealed, although by the time of filing their terms as Speaker and President had expired; their successors, [[Chuck Hardwick]] and [[John F. Russo]], joined the executive officers in refusing to defend the constitutionality of the statute. Karcher and Orechio's lawyer, [[Rex E.

The court found that the former legislative leaders lacked standing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1987/12/09/07390036.h07.html|title=Technicality Bars Ruling On Moments of Silence|last=Mirga|first=Tom|date=December 9, 1987|work=Education Week|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that that authority had passed by design to the current leaders of the New Jersey legislature.&lt;ref name="Schwartz1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=|title=Section 1983 Lit: Clms V1b 3e|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5tmAUU_QtqQC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=1995-12-31|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=9780735549357|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s majority decision was joined by six other justices, with Justice [[Byron White]] writing a concurring opinion. There was no ninth vote, as Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] had resigned earlier in the year, and no replacement had yet been confirmed.

As a result of this opinion, the district court ruling that the law was unconstitutional was left intact.&lt;ref name=kamen/&gt;

==Overview of models==
There are many different learning styles models; one literature review identified 71 different models.&lt;ref name="Coffield" /&gt;{{rp|166–168}} Only a few models are described below.

===David Kolb's model===
[[David A. Kolb]]'s model is based on his [[experiential learning]] model, as explained in his book ''Experiential Learning''.&lt;ref name="Kolb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kolb |first=David A. |authorlink=David A. Kolb |date=2015 |origyear=1984 |title=Experiential learning: experience as the source of learning and development |edition=2nd |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=9780133892406 |oclc=909815841 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6DfBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolb's model outlines two related approaches toward grasping experience: ''Concrete Experience'' and ''Abstract Conceptualization'', as well as two related approaches toward transforming experience: ''Reflective Observation'' and ''Active Experimentation''.&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;{{rp|145}} According to Kolb's model, the ideal learning process engages all four of these modes in response to situational demands; they form a [[learning cycle]] from experience to observation to conceptualization to experimentation and back to experience. In order for learning to be effective, Kolb postulated, all four of these approaches must be incorporated. As individuals attempt to use all four approaches, they may tend to develop strengths in one experience-grasping approach and one experience-transforming approach, leading them to prefer one of the following four learning styles:&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;{{rp|127}}&lt;ref name="SmithKolb1986"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Donna M. |last2=Kolb |first2=David A. |authorlink2=David A. Kolb |date=1996 |origyear=1986 |title=User's guide for the learning-style inventory: a manual for teachers and trainers |location=Boston |publisher=McBer |oclc=38505355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Accommodator = ''Concrete Experience + Active Experiment'': strong in "hands-on" practical doing (e.g., [[physical therapist]]s)
# Converger = ''Abstract Conceptualization + Active Experiment'': strong in practical "hands-on" application of theories (e.g., [[engineer]]s)
# Diverger = ''Concrete Experience + Reflective Observation'': strong in imaginative ability and discussion (e.g., [[social worker]]s)
# Assimilator = ''Abstract Conceptualization + Reflective Observation'': strong in inductive reasoning and creation of theories (e.g., [[philosopher]]s)

Kolb's model gave rise to the Learning Style Inventory, an assessment method used to determine an individual's learning style. According to this model, individuals may exhibit a preference for one of the four styles — Accommodating, Converging, Diverging and Assimilating — depending on their approach to learning in Kolb's experiential learning model.&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;

Although Kolb's model is widely accepted with substantial empirical support and has been revised over the years, a 2013 study pointed out that Kolb's Learning Style Inventory, among its other weaknesses, incorrectly dichotomizes individuals on the abstract/concrete and reflective/action dimensions of experiential learning (in much the same way as the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] does in a different context), and proposed instead that these dimensions be treated as continuous rather than dichotomous/binary variables.&lt;ref name="Manolis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manolis |first1=Chris |last2=Burns |first2=David J. |last3=Assudani |first3=Rashmi |last4=Chinta |first4=Ravi |date=February 2013 |title=Assessing experiential learning styles: a methodological reconstruction and validation of the Kolb Learning Style Inventory |journal=[[Learning and Individual Differences]] |volume=23 |pages=44–52 |doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2012.10.009 |url=http://research.phoenix.edu/sites/default/files/publication-files/2012-Manolis%20et%20al(2012).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

===Peter Honey and Alan Mumford's model===
Peter Honey and Alan Mumford adapted Kolb's experiential learning model. First, they renamed the stages in the [[learning cycle]] to accord with [[managerial]] experiences: ''having'' an experience, ''reviewing'' the experience, ''concluding'' from the experience, and ''planning'' the next steps.&lt;ref name="Mumford"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mumford |first=Alan |chapter=Putting learning styles to work |title=Action learning at work |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgOoHgxObfwC&amp;pg=PA121 |year=1997 |publisher=Gower |location=Aldershot, Hampshire; Brookfield, VT |pages=121–135 |isbn=0566078902 |oclc=35777384}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121–122}} Second, they aligned these stages to four learning styles named:&lt;ref name="Mumford"/&gt;{{rp|122–124}}

# Activist
# Reflector
# Theorist 
# Pragmatist

These four learning styles are assumed to be acquired preferences that are adaptable, either at will or through changed circumstances, rather than being fixed personality characteristics. Honey and Mumford's Learning Styles Questionnaire (LSQ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Honey |first1=Peter |last2=Mumford |first2=Alan |date=2006 |title=Learning styles questionnaire: 80-item version |location=London |publisher=Maidenhead |isbn=1902899296 |oclc=889619009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a self-development tool and differs from Kolb's Learning Style Inventory by inviting managers to complete a checklist of work-related behaviours without directly asking managers how they learn. Having completed the self-assessment, managers are encouraged to focus on strengthening underutilised styles in order to become better equipped to learn from a wide range of everyday experiences.

A [[Ipsos MORI|MORI]] survey commissioned by The Campaign for Learning in 1999 found the Honey and Mumford LSQ to be the most widely used system for assessing preferred learning styles in the local government sector in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Learning modalities===
Walter Burke Barbe and colleagues proposed three learning modalities (often identified by the [[acronym]] VAK):&lt;ref name="Barbe1979"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barbe |first1=Walter Burke |last2=Swassing |first2=Raymond H. |last3=Milone |first3=Michael N. |date=1979 |title=Teaching through modality strengths: concepts practices |location=Columbus, Ohio |publisher=Zaner-Bloser |isbn=0883091003 |oclc=5990906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbe and colleagues reported that learning modality strengths can occur independently or in combination (although the most frequent modality strengths, according to their research, are visual or mixed), they can change over time, and they become integrated with age.&lt;ref name="Barbe1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barbe |first1=Walter Burke |last2=Milone |first2=Michael N. |title=What we know about modality strengths |journal=Educational Leadership |publisher=[[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]] |date=February 1981 |pages=378–380 |url=http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_198102_barbe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also pointed out that learning modality ''strengths'' are different from ''preferences''; a person's self-reported modality preference may not correspond to their empirically measured modality strength.&lt;ref name="Barbe1981"/&gt;{{rp|378}} This disconnect between strengths and preferences was confirmed by a subsequent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krätzig |first1=Gregory P. |last2=Arbuthnott |first2=Katherine D. |date=February 2006 |title=Perceptual learning style and learning proficiency: a test of the hypothesis |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=238–246 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some scholars have criticized the VAK model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sharp |first1=John G. |last2=Bowker |first2=Rob |last3=Byrne |first3=Jenny |date=September 2008 |title=VAK or VAK-uous?: towards the trivialisation of learning and the death of scholarship |journal=Research Papers in Education |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=293–314 |doi=10.1080/02671520701755416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=Shirley |date=March 2006 |title=VAKing out learning styles—why the notion of 'learning styles' is unhelpful to teachers |journal=Education 3–13: International Journal of Primary, Elementary and Early Years Education |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=81–87 |doi=10.1080/03004270500507644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Scott Lilienfeld]] and colleagues have argued that much use of the VAK model is nothing more than [[pseudoscience]] or a psychological [[urban legend]].&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott O. |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |last2=Lynn |first2=Steven Jay |last3=Ruscio |first3=John |last4=Beyerstein |first4=Barry L. |authorlink4=Barry Beyerstein |date=2010 |chapter=Myth #18: Students learn best when teaching styles are matched to their learning styles |title=50 great myths of popular psychology: shattering widespread misconceptions about human behavior |location=Chichester, UK; Malden, MA |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |isbn=9781405131117 |oclc=396172891 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;pg=PT85 |pages=92–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neil Fleming's VAK/VARK model===
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Neil Fleming]], [[Visual learning]], [[Auditory learning]], [[Kinesthetic learning]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;

# [[Observational learning|Social learning]]

Fleming claimed that [[Visual learning|visual learners]] have a preference for seeing (visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Subsequent [[neuroimaging]] research has suggested that visual learners convert words into images in the brain and vice versa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kraemer |first1=David J. M. |last2=Rosenberg |first2=Lauren M. |last3=Thompson-Schill |first3=Sharon L. |date=March 2009 |title=The neural correlates of visual and verbal cognitive styles |journal=[[The Journal of Neuroscience]] |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=3792–3798 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4635-08.2009 |pmid=19321775 |pmc=2697032}} Also reported in: {{cite web |date=28 March 2009 |title=Visual learners convert words to pictures in the brain and vice versa, says psychology study |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090325091834.htm |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some psychologists have argued that this "is not an instance of learning styles, rather, it is an instance of ability appearing as a style".&lt;ref name="Willingham2015"/&gt;{{rp|268}} Likewise, Fleming claimed that [[Auditory learning|auditory learners]] best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.), and [[Kinesthetic learning|tactile/kinesthetic learners]] prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world, science projects, experiments, etc.). Students can use the model to identify their preferred learning style and, it is claimed, maximize their learning by focusing on the mode that benefits them the most. Fleming's model also posits two types of multimodality.&lt;ref name="VARK"/&gt;

===Anthony Gregorc's model===
[[Anthony Gregorc]] and Kathleen Butler organized a model describing different learning styles rooted in the way individuals acquire and process information differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Kathleen Ann |last2=Gregorc |first2=Anthony F. |authorlink2=Anthony Gregorc |date=1988 |title=It's all in your mind: a student's guide to learning style |location=Columbia, CT |publisher=Learner's Dimension |isbn=0945852010 |oclc=20848567}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model posits that an individual's perceptual abilities are the foundation of his or her specific learning strengths, or learning styles.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Margaret |title=Mind Styles: Anthony Gregorc |url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm |website=cortland.edu |date=3 February 2004 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model, there are two perceptual qualities: ''concrete'' and ''abstract'', and two ordering abilities: ''random'' and ''sequential''.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Concrete perceptions involve registering information through the five senses, while abstract perceptions involve the understanding of ideas, qualities, and concepts which cannot be seen. In regard to the two ordering abilities, sequential ordering involves the organization of information in a linear, logical way, and random ordering involves the organization of information in chunks and in no specific order.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The model posits that both of the perceptual qualities and both of the ordering abilities are present in each individual, but some qualities and ordering abilities are more dominant within certain individuals.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

There are four combinations of perceptual qualities and ordering abilities based on dominance: ''concrete sequential'', ''abstract random'', ''abstract sequential'', and ''concrete random''. The model posits that individuals with different combinations learn in different ways—they have different strengths, different things make sense to them, different things are difficult for them, and they ask different questions throughout the learning process.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

The [[Test validity|validity]] of Gregorc's model has been questioned by Thomas Reio and Albert Wiswell following experimental trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reio |first1=Thomas G. |last2=Wiswell |first2=Albert K. |date=June 2006 |title=An examination of the factor structure and construct validity of the Gregorc Style Delineator |journal=[[Educational and Psychological Measurement]] |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=489–501 |doi=10.1177/0013164405282459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorc argues that his critics have "scientifically-limited views" and that they wrongly repudiate the "mystical elements" of "the spirit" that can only be discerned by a "subtle human instrument".&lt;ref name="Gregorc"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregorc |first=Anthony F. |authorlink=Anthony Gregorc |title=Frequently asked questions on style |url=http://gregorc.com/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504072936/http://gregorc.com/faq.html |website=gregorc.com |date=29 January 2015 |archivedate=4 May 2015 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive approaches===
Anthony Grasha and Sheryl Riechmann, in 1974, formulated the Grasha-Reichmann Learning Style Scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riechmann |first1=Sheryl Wetter |last2=Grasha |first2=Anthony F. |date=July 1974 |title=A rational approach to developing and assessing the construct validity of a student learning style scales instrument |journal=[[The Journal of Psychology]] |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=213–223 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1974.9915693}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed to analyze the attitudes of students and how they approach learning. The test was originally designed to provide teachers with insight on how to approach instructional plans for college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grasha |first=Anthony F. |date=1996 |title=Teaching with style: a practical guide to enhancing learning by understanding teaching and learning styles |series=Curriculum for change series |location=Pittsburgh |publisher=Alliance Publishers |isbn=0964507110 |oclc=34349818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasha's background was in [[cognitive processes]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] techniques. Unlike some models of cognitive styles which are relatively nonjudgmental, Grasha and Riechmann distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive styles. The names of Grasha and Riechmann's learning styles are:

*avoidant
*participative
*competitive
*collaborative
*dependent
*independent

Aiming to explain why aptitude tests, school grades, and classroom performance often fail to identify real ability, [[Robert Sternberg]] listed various cognitive dimensions in his book ''Thinking Styles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sternberg |first=Robert J. |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |date=1997 |title=Thinking styles |location=Cambridge, UK; New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0521553164 |oclc=36315844 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dgxBqGIfJjAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other models are also often used when researching [[cognitive style]]s; some of these models are described in books that Sternberg co-edited, such as ''Perspectives on Thinking, Learning, and Cognitive Styles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Sternberg |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor1-link=Robert Sternberg |editor2-last=Zhang |editor2-first=Li-fang |date=2001 |title=Perspectives on thinking, learning, and cognitive styles |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |isbn=0805834303 |oclc=44619517 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMeQAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Zhang |editor1-first=Li-fang |editor2-last=Sternberg |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-link=Robert Sternberg |date=2009 |title=Perspectives on the nature of intellectual styles |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=9780826104601 |oclc=301893408 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6drSmW4AbfEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Zhang |editor1-first=Li-fang |editor2-last=Sternberg |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-link=Robert Sternberg |editor3-last=Rayner |editor3-first=Stephen |date=2012 |title=Handbook of intellectual styles: preferences in cognition, learning, and thinking |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=9780826106674 |oclc=714734148 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Og8rJGaXCDwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASSP model===
In the 1980s, the [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]] (NASSP) formed a task force to study learning styles.&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keefe |first=James W. |date=March 1985 |title=Assessment of learning style variables: the NASSP task force model |journal=Theory Into Practice |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=138–144 |jstor=1476430 |doi=10.1080/00405848509543162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task force defined three broad categories of style—cognitive, affective, and physiological—and 31 variables, including the perceptual strengths and preferences from the VAK model of Barbe and colleagues,&lt;ref name="Barbe1981"/&gt; but also many other variables such as need for structure, types of motivation, time of day preferences, and so on.&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"/&gt;{{rp|141–143}} They defined a learning style as "a ''[[Holism|gestalt]]''—not an amalgam of related characteristics but greater than any of its parts. It is a composite of internal and external operations based in neurobiology, personality, and human development and reflected in learner behavior."&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"/&gt;{{rp|141}}

* Cognitive styles are preferred ways of perception, organization and retention.
* Affective styles represent the motivational dimensions of the learning personality; each learner has a personal motivational approach.
* Physiological styles are bodily states or predispositions, including sex-related differences, health and nutrition, and reaction to physical surroundings, such as preferences for levels of light, sound, and temperature.&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"/&gt;{{rp|141}}

According to the NASSP task force, styles are hypothetical constructs that help to explain the learning (and teaching) process. They posited that one can recognize the learning style of an individual student by observing his or her behavior.&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"/&gt;{{rp|138}} Learning has taken place only when one observes a relatively stable change in learner behavior resulting from what has been experienced.

==Assessment methods==

===Learning Style Inventory===
The Learning Style Inventory (LSI) is connected with [[David A. Kolb]]'s model and is used to determine a student's learning style.&lt;ref name="SmithKolb1986"/&gt; Previous versions of the LSI have been criticized for problems with validity, reliability, and other issues.&lt;ref name="Manolis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koob |first1=Jeffrey J. |last2=Funk |first2=Joanie |date=March 2002 |title=Kolb's learning style inventory: issues of reliability and validity |journal=[[Research on Social Work Practice]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=293–308 |doi=10.1177/104973150201200206 |url=http://www.bu.edu/ssw/files/2010/10/Kolbs-Learning-Style-Inventory-Issues-of-Reliability-and-Validity1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metallidou |first1=Panayiota |last2=Platsidou |first2=Maria |date=2008 |title=Kolb's Learning Style Inventory-1985: validity issues and relations with metacognitive knowledge about problem-solving strategies |journal=[[Learning and Individual Differences]] |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=114–119 |doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2007.11.001 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Platsidou/publication/229383282_Kolb%27s_Learning_Style_Inventory-1985_Validity_issues_and_relations_with_metacognitive_knowledge_about_problem-solving_strategies/links/0fcfd50b9cf157eecc000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 4 of the Learning Style Inventory replaces the four learning styles of previous versions with nine new learning styles: initiating, experiencing, imagining, reflecting, analyzing, thinking, deciding, acting, and balancing.&lt;ref name="LSI4"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kolb learning style inventory (KLSI), version 4 online: description |url=http://www.haygroup.com/leadershipandtalentondemand/ourproducts/item_details.aspx?itemid=118&amp;type=2&amp;t=2 |website=haygroup.com |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSI is intended to help employees or students "understand how their learning style impacts upon problem solving, teamwork, handling conflict, communication and career choice; develop more learning flexibility; find out why teams work well—or badly—together; strengthen their overall learning."&lt;ref name="LSI4"/&gt;

A completely different Learning Styles Inventory is associated with a binary division of learning styles, developed by [[Richard Felder]] and Linda Silverman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Felder |first1=Richard M. |last2=Silverman |first2=Linda K. |date=January 1988 |title=Learning and teaching styles in engineering education |journal=Engineering Education |volume=78 |issue=7 |pages=674–81 |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/LS-1988.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Felder and Silverman's model, learning styles are a balance between pairs of extremes such as: Active/Reflective, Sensing/Intuitive, Verbal/Visual, and Sequential/Global. Students receive four scores describing these balances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html |title=Index of learning styles questionnaire |first=Barbara A. |last=Soloman |first2=Richard M. |last2=Felder |publisher=[[North Carolina State University]] |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the LSI mentioned above, this inventory provides overviews and synopses for teachers.

===NASSP Learning Style Profile===
The NASSP Learning Style Profile (LSP) is a second-generation instrument for the diagnosis of student cognitive styles, perceptual responses, and study and instructional preferences.&lt;ref name="KeefeMonk1988"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keefe |first1=James W. |last2=Monk |first2=John S. |date=1988 |title=Learning style profile: technical manual |location=Reston, VA |publisher=[[National Association of Secondary School Principals]] |isbn=0882102133 |oclc=22143235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSP is a diagnostic tool intended as the basis for comprehensive style assessment with students in the sixth to twelfth grades. It was developed by the [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]] research department in conjunction with a national task force of learning style experts. The Profile was developed in four phases with initial work undertaken at the [[University of Vermont]] (cognitive elements), [[Ohio State University]] (affective elements), and [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] (physiological/environmental elements). Rigid validation and normative studies were conducted using factor analytic methods to ensure strong construct validity and subscale independence.

The LSP contains 23 scales representing four higher order factors: cognitive styles, perceptual responses, study preferences and instructional preferences (the affective and physiological elements). The LSP scales are: analytic skill, spatial skill, discrimination skill, categorizing skill, sequential processing skill, simultaneous processing skill, memory skill, perceptual response: visual, perceptual response: auditory, perceptual response: emotive, persistence orientation, verbal risk orientation, verbal-spatial preference, manipulative preference, study time preference: early morning, study time preference: late morning, study time preference: afternoon, study time preference: evening, grouping preference, posture preference, mobility preference, sound preference, lighting preference, temperature preference.&lt;ref name="KeefeMonk1988"/&gt;

===Other methods===
Other methods (usually questionnaires) used to identify learning styles include [[Neil Fleming]]'s VARK Questionnaire&lt;ref name="Leite"/&gt; and Jackson's Learning Styles Profiler.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|56–59}} Many other tests have gathered popularity and various levels of credibility among students and teachers.

==In the classroom==
Various researchers have attempted to hypothesize ways in which learning style theory can be used in the classroom. Two such scholars are Rita Dunn and Kenneth Dunn, who build upon a [[#Learning modalities|learning modalities]] approach.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|20–35}}&lt;ref name="Dunn1978"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunn |first1=Rita Stafford |last2=Dunn |first2=Kenneth J. |date=1978 |title=Teaching students through their individual learning styles: a practical approach |location=Reston, VA |publisher=Reston Pub. Co. |isbn=0879098082 |oclc=3844703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although learning styles will inevitably differ among students in the classroom, Dunn and Dunn say that teachers should try to make changes in their classroom that will be beneficial to every learning style. Some of these changes include room redesign, the development of small-group techniques, and the development of "contract activity packages".&lt;ref name="Dunn1978"/&gt; Redesigning the classroom involves locating dividers that can be used to arrange the room creatively (such as having different learning stations and instructional areas), clearing the floor area, and incorporating student thoughts and ideas into the design of the classroom.&lt;ref name="Dunn1978"/&gt;

Dunn and Dunn's "contract activity packages" are educational plans that use: a clear statement of the learning need; multisensory resources (auditory, visual, tactile, kinesthetic); activities through which the newly mastered information can be used creatively; the sharing of creative projects within small groups; at least three small-group techniques; a pre-test, a self-test, and a post-test.&lt;ref name="Dunn1978"/&gt;

Another scholar who believes that learning styles should have an effect on the classroom is Marilee Sprenger in ''Differentiation through Learning Styles and Memory''.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sprenger |first=Marilee |date=2008 |origyear=2003 |title=Differentiation through learning styles and memory |edition=2nd |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Corwin Press]] |isbn=9781412955447 |oclc=192109691 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaVu2p5uDBkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bases her work on three premises:
#Teachers can be learners, and learners teachers. We are all both.
#Everyone can learn under the right circumstances.
#Learning is fun! Make it appealing.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

Sprenger details how to teach in visual, auditory, or tactile/kinesthetic ways. Methods for visual learners include ensuring that students can see words written, using pictures, and drawing [[timeline]]s for events.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} Methods for auditory learners include repeating words aloud, small-group discussion, debates, listening to books on tape, oral reports, and oral interpretation.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} Methods for tactile/kinesthetic learners include hands-on activities (experiments, etc.), projects, frequent breaks to allow movement, visual aids, role play, and field trips.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} By using a variety of teaching methods from each of these categories, teachers cater to different learning styles at once, and improve learning by challenging students to learn in different ways.

James W. Keefe and John M. Jenkins have incorporated learning style assessment as a basic component in their "personalized instruction" model of schooling.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keefe |first1=James W. |last2=Jenkins |first2=John M. |date=2008 |origyear=2000 |title=Personalized instruction: the key to student achievement |edition=2nd |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] Education |isbn=9781578867554 |oclc=173509416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six basic elements constitute the culture and context of personalized instruction. The cultural components—teacher role, student learning characteristics, and collegial relationships—establish the foundation of personalization and ensure that the school prizes a caring and collaborative environment. The contextual factors—interactivity, flexible scheduling, and authentic assessment—establish the structure of personalization.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

According to Keefe and Jenkins, cognitive and learning style analysis have a special role in the process of personalizing instruction. The assessment of student learning style, more than any other element except the teacher role, establishes the foundation for a personalized approach to schooling: for student advisement and placement, for appropriate retraining of student cognitive skills, for adaptive instructional strategy, and for the authentic evaluation of learning.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} Some learners respond best in instructional environments based on an analysis of their perceptual and environmental style preferences: most individualized and personalized teaching methods reflect this point of view. Other learners, however, need help to function successfully in ''any'' learning environment. If a youngster cannot cope under conventional instruction, enhancing his cognitive skills may make successful achievement possible.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

Many of the student learning problems that learning style diagnosis attempts to solve relate directly to elements of the human information processing system. Processes such as attention, perception and memory, and operations such as integration and retrieval of information are internal to the system. Any hope for improving student learning necessarily involves an understanding and application of information processing theory. Learning style assessment can provide a window to understanding and managing this process.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

At least one study evaluating teaching styles and learning styles, however, has found that congruent groups have no significant differences in achievement from incongruent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoon |first1=Jerry C. |last2=Schell |first2=John W. |date=Winter 1998 |title=Aligning student learning styles with instructor teaching styles |journal=Journal of Industrial Teacher Education |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=41–56 |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JITE/v35n2/spoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, learning style in this study varied by demography, specifically by age, suggesting a change in learning style as one gets older and acquires more experience. While significant age differences did occur, as well as no experimental manipulation of classroom assignment, the findings do call into question the aim of congruent teaching–learning styles in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|122}}

Educational researchers Eileen Carnell and Caroline Lodge concluded that learning styles are not fixed and that they are dependent on circumstance, purpose and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carnell |first1=Eileen |last2=Lodge |first2=Caroline |date=2002 |title=Supporting effective learning |location=London; Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Paul Chapman Publishing; [[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=0761970460 |oclc=48110229 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=5AgCUC7M05sC&amp;pg=PA22 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Learning style theories have been criticized by many scholars and researchers. Some psychologists and neuroscientists have questioned the scientific basis for separating out students based on learning style. According to [[Susan Greenfield]] the practice is "nonsense" from a neuroscientific point of view: "Humans have evolved to build a picture of the world through our senses working in unison, exploiting the immense interconnectivity that exists in the brain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henry |first=Julie |title=Professor pans 'learning style' teaching method |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1558822/Professor-pans-learning-style-teaching-method.html |accessdate=29 August 2010 |newspaper=[[The Telegraph (U.K.)|The Telegraph]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219060846/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1558822/Professor-pans-learning-style-teaching-method.html |archivedate=19 December 2009 |date=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Educational psychology|educational psychologists]] have shown that there is little evidence for the efficacy of most learning style models, and furthermore, that the models often rest on dubious theoretical grounds.&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Curry |first=Lynn |year=October 1990 |title=A critique of the research on learning styles |journal=Educational Leadership |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohrer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rohrer |first1=Doug |last2=Pashler |first2=Harold |date=July 2012 |title=Learning styles: where's the evidence? |journal=Medical Education |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=634–635 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04273.x |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535732.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to professor of education Steven Stahl, there has been an "utter failure to find that assessing children's learning styles and matching to instructional methods has any effect on their learning."&lt;ref name="Stahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stahl |first=Steven A. |date=2004 |chapter=Different strokes for different folks? |editor-last=Abbeduto |editor-first=Leonard |title=Taking sides: clashing views on controversial issues in educational psychology |location=Guilford, CT |publisher=Dushkin/[[McGraw-Hill]] |pages=98–107 |isbn=0072917237 |oclc=53479331 |chapterurl=http://linksprogram.gmu.edu/tutorcorner/NCLC495Readings/Stahl_DifferentStrokes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of education Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as VARK are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Claxton |first=Guy |date=2008 |title=What's the point of school?: rediscovering the heart of education |location=Richmond |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] |isbn=9781851686032 |oclc=228582273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X3YAQAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22learning+styles%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, psychologist Kris Vasquez pointed out a number of problems with learning styles, including the lack of empirical evidence that learning styles are useful in producing student achievement, but also her more serious concern that the use of learning styles in the classroom could lead students to develop self-limiting implicit theories about themselves that could become [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]] that are harmful, rather than beneficial, to the goal of serving student diversity.&lt;ref name="Vasquez"/&gt;

Psychologists [[Scott Lilienfeld]], [[Barry Beyerstein]], and colleagues listed as one of the "50 great myths of popular psychology" the idea that "students learn best when teaching styles are matched to their learning styles", and they summarized some relevant reasons not to believe this "myth".&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"/&gt;

===Critique made by Coffield et al.===
A 2004 non-peer-reviewed literature review by authors from the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]] criticized most of the main instruments used to identify an individual's learning style.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt; In conducting the review, Frank Coffield and his colleagues selected 13 of the most influential models of the 71 models they identified,&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|8–9}} including most of the models cited on this page. They examined the theoretical origins and terms of each model, and the instrument that purported to assess individuals against the learning styles defined by the model. They analyzed the claims made by the author(s), external studies of these claims, and independent empirical evidence of the relationship between the learning style identified by the instrument and students' actual learning. Coffield's team found that none of the most popular learning style theories had been adequately validated through independent research.

One of the most widely known theories assessed by Coffield's team was the learning styles model of Dunn and Dunn. This model is widely used in schools in the United States, and 177 articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals referring to this model.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|20}} The conclusion of Coffield and colleagues was: "Despite a large and evolving research programme, forceful claims made for impact are questionable because of limitations in many of the supporting studies and the lack of independent research on the model."&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Coffield's team claimed that another model, [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Gregorc Style Delineator, was "theoretically and psychometrically flawed" and "not suitable for the assessment of individuals".&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

===Critique of Kolb's model===
Mark K. Smith compiled and reviewed some critiques of Kolb's model in his article, "David A. Kolb on Experiential Learning". According to Smith's research, there are six key issues regarding the model:

# The model doesn't adequately address the process of reflection; 
# The claims it makes about the four learning styles are extravagant; 
# It doesn't sufficiently address the fact of different cultural conditions and experiences; 
# The idea of stages/steps doesn't necessarily match reality; 
# It has only weak empirical evidence; 
# The relationship between learning processes and knowledge is more complex than Kolb draws it.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Mark K. |title=David A. Kolb on experiential learning |url=http://infed.org/mobi/david-a-kolb-on-experiential-learning/ |website=infed.org |date=April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705001707/http://infed.org/mobi/david-a-kolb-on-experiential-learning/ |archivedate=5 July 2015 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted, however, that the most recent work by Kolb that Smith cites is from 2005, and he does not address the changes in the 2015 edition of Kolb's book ''Experiential Learning''.&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;

===Other critiques===
Coffield and his colleagues and Mark Smith are not alone in their judgements. [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]], a UK think tank, published a report on learning styles prepared by a group chaired by [[David Hargreaves (academic)|David Hargreaves]] that included [[Usha Goswami]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] and David Wood from the [[University of Nottingham]]. The Demos report said that the evidence for learning styles was "highly variable", and that practitioners were "not by any means always frank about the evidence for their work".&lt;ref name="Hargreaves"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beere |first1=Jackie |last2=Swindells |first2=Maggie |last3=Wise |first3=Derek |last4=Desforges |first4=Charles |last5=Goswami |first5=Usha |authorlink5=Usha Goswami |last6=Wood |first6=David |last7=Horne |first7=Matthew |last8=Lownsbrough |first8=Hannah |last9=Hargreaves |first9=David |authorlink9=David Hargreaves (academic) |date=2005 |title=About learning: report of the Learning Working Group |location=London |publisher=[[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] |isbn=1841801402 |oclc=59877244 |url=http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/aboutlearning}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

Cautioning against interpreting neuropsychological research as supporting the applicability of learning style theory, John Geake, Professor of Education at the UK's [[Oxford Brookes University]], and a research collaborator with [[Oxford University]]'s Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, commented: "We need to take extreme care when moving from the lab to the classroom. We do remember things visually and aurally, but information isn't defined by how it was received."&lt;ref name="Revell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Revell |first=Phil |date=30 May 2005 |title=Each to their own |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,1495514,00.html |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304034655/http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0%2C%2C1495514%2C00.html |archivedate= 4 March 2007 |accessdate=9 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Daniel T. Willingham]] also holds true to the idea that there is not enough evidence to support a theory describing the differences in learning styles amongst students. In his book ''Why Don't Students Like School'',&lt;ref name="Willingham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willingham |first=Daniel T. |authorlink=Daniel T. Willingham |date=2009 |title=Why don't students like school?: a cognitive scientist answers questions about how the mind works and what it means for the classroom |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |isbn=9780470279304 |oclc=255894389 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SDs8LZl41EC}}&lt;/ref&gt; he claims that a cognitive styles theory must have three features: "it should consistently attribute to a person the same style, it should show that people with different abilities think and learn differently, and it should show that people with different styles do not, on average, differ in ability."&lt;ref name="Willingham"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} That being said, he concludes that there are no theories that have these three crucial characteristics, not necessarily implying that cognitive styles don't exist but rather stating that psychologists are unable to "find them".&lt;ref name="Willingham"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

===2009 APS critique===
In late 2009, the journal ''[[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]]'' of the [[Association for Psychological Science]] (APS) published a report on the scientific validity of learning styles practices.&lt;ref name="Pashler"/&gt; The panel of experts that wrote the article, led by [[Harold Pashler]] of the [[University of California, San Diego]], concluded that an adequate evaluation of the learning styles hypothesis—the idea that optimal learning demands that students receive instruction tailored to their learning styles—requires a particular kind of study. Specifically, students should be grouped into the learning style categories that are being evaluated (e.g., visual learners vs. verbal learners), and then students in each group must be randomly assigned to one of the learning methods (e.g., visual learning or verbal learning), so that some students will be "matched" and others will be "mismatched". At the end of the experiment, all students must sit for the same test. If the learning style hypothesis is correct, then, for example, visual learners should learn better with the visual method, whereas auditory learners should learn better with the auditory method. As disclosed in the report, the panel found that studies utilizing this essential research design were virtually absent from the learning styles literature. In fact, the panel was able to find only a few studies with this research design, and all but one of these studies were negative findings—that is, they found that the same learning method was superior for all kinds of students.&lt;ref name="Pashler"/&gt; Examples of such negative findings include the research of Laura J. Massa and [[Richard E. Mayer]],&lt;ref name="Massa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Massa |first1=Laura J. |last2=Mayer |first2=Richard E. |authorlink2=Richard E. Mayer |date=2006 |title=Testing the ATI hypothesis: should multimedia instruction accommodate verbalizer-visualizer cognitive style? |journal=[[Learning and Individual Differences]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=321–335 |doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2006.10.001 |url=http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/cs6604/Papers/Validity_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more recent research since the 2009 review.&lt;ref name="Willingham2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kollöffel |first=Bas |date=February 2012 |title=Exploring the relation between visualizer–verbalizer cognitive styles and performance with visual or verbal learning material |journal=Computers &amp; Education |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=697–706 |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2011.09.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rogowsky |first1=Beth A. |last2=Calhoun |first2=Barbara M. |last3=Tallal |first3=Paula |authorlink3=Paula Tallal |date=2015 |title=Matching learning style to instructional method: effects on comprehension |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=64–78 |doi=10.1037/a0037478|url=https://zenodo.org/record/977853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the panel noted that, even if the requisite finding were obtained, the benefits would need to be large, and not just statistically significant, before learning style interventions could be recommended as cost-effective. That is, the cost of evaluating and classifying students by their learning style, and then providing customized instruction would need to be more beneficial than other interventions (e.g., one-on-one tutoring, after school remediation programs, etc.).&lt;ref name="Pashler"/&gt;{{rp|116–117}}

As a consequence, the panel concluded, "at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number."&lt;ref name="Pashler" /&gt;{{rp|105}}

The article incited critical comments from some defenders of learning styles. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' reported that [[Robert Sternberg]] from [[Tufts University]] spoke out against the paper: "Several of the most-cited researchers on learning styles, Mr. Sternberg points out, do not appear in the paper's bibliography."&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glenn |first=David |date=15 December 2009 |title=Matching teaching style to learning style may not help students |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Matching-Teaching-Style-to/49497/ |accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This charge was also discussed by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', which reported that Pashler said, "Just so... most of [the evidence] is 'weak'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holden |first=Constance |date=8 January 2010 |title=Learning with style |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=327 |issue=5692 |pages=129 |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/Learning_With_Style-Science.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.327.5962.129-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Chronicle'' reported that even [[David A. Kolb]] partly agreed with Pashler; Kolb said: "The paper correctly mentions the practical and ethical problems of sorting people into groups and labeling them. Tracking in education has a bad history."&lt;ref name="Glenn"/&gt;

'''''Lee v. Weisman''''', 505 U.S. 577 (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lee v. Weisman|505|577|1992}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision regarding school prayer. It was the first major [[school prayer]] case decided by the [[Rehnquist]] Court. It ruled that schools may not sponsor clerics to conduct even non-denominational prayer. The Court followed a broad interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]] that had been standard for decades at the nation's highest court, a reaffirmation of the principles of such landmark cases as ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Engel v. Vitale|370|421|1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp|Abington v. Schempp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Abington School District v. Schempp|374|203|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Robert E. Lee was the principal of Nathan Bishop Middle School in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. He invited a rabbi to deliver a prayer at the 1989 graduation ceremony, but the parents of student Deborah Weisman requested a temporary injunction to bar the rabbi from speaking. The question being reviewed was whether or not this was constitutional. The [[U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island|Rhode Island district court]] denied the Weismans' motion. The family did attend the graduation ceremony, and the rabbi did deliver the benediction. 

The Weismans continued their litigation after the graduation and won a victory at the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The school district appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the prayer was nonsectarian and was doubly voluntary: Deborah was free not to stand for the prayer and because participation in the ceremony itself was not required. Arguments were heard on November 6, 1991. [[Associate Justice|Justice]] [[Anthony Kennedy]] had been critical of the Court's decisions on school prayer, and many court watchers thought that he would provide the crucial fifth vote to reverse the lower court's ruling and deal a major blow to the twin separationist pillars of ''Engel'' and ''Abington''.'''

==Decision==
The 5–4 decision was announced on June 24, 1992. It was somewhat surprising as a victory for the Weismans and a defeat for the school district. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which maintained previous Supreme Court precedents sharply limiting the place of religion within the nation's public schools—far from joining those who favored curtailing restrictions on school prayers. The [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]] papers reveal that Kennedy switched his vote during the deliberations, as he also did in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|link=|volume=505|page=833|pin=|year=1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that his draft majority opinion upholding the prayer exercise "looked quite wrong." Instead, Kennedy wrote an opinion that repudiated the school district's main arguments. He found fault with Principal Lee's decision to give the rabbi who was planning to offer the graduation invocation a pamphlet on composing prayers for civic occasions:

:Through these means, the principal directed and controlled the content of the prayers. Even if the only sanction for ignoring the instructions were that the rabbi would not be invited back, we think no religious representative who valued his or her continued reputation and effectiveness in the community would incur the State's displeasure in this regard. It is a cornerstone principle of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence that it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government, and that is what the school officials attempted to do.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 588 citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy also noted that the nonsectarian nature of the prayer was no defense, as the Establishment Clause forbade coerced prayers in public schools, not just those representing a specific religious tradition. He addressed the State's contention that attendance was voluntary at the graduation exercises:

:To say a teenage student has a real choice not to attend her high school graduation is formalistic in the extreme. True, Deborah could elect not to attend commencement without renouncing her diploma; but we shall not allow the case to turn on this point. Everyone knows that, in our society and in our culture, high school graduation is one of life's most significant occasions. A school rule which excuses attendance is beside the point. Attendance may not be required by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student is not free to absent herself from the graduation exercise in any real sense of the term "voluntary," for absence would require forfeiture of those intangible benefits which have motivated the student through youth and all her high school years.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Kennedy formulated what is now known as the coercion test in answering the argument that participation in the prayer was voluntary:

:The school district's supervision and control of a high school graduation ceremony places subtle and indirect public and peer pressure on attending students to stand as a group or maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. A reasonable dissenter of high school age could believe that standing or remaining silent signified her own participation in, or approval of, the group exercise, rather than her respect for it. And the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a ''[[de minimis]]'' character, since that is an affront to the rabbi and those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors' rights.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. 577, Syllabus.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The principle that government may accommodate the [[Free Exercise Clause|free exercise of religion]] does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by '''the [[Establishment Clause]]'''. It is beyond dispute that, '''at a minimum''', the Constitution '''guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which "establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so."'''&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 587 (citations omitted and emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

:As we have observed before, there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools. Our decisions in [Engel] and [Abington] recognize, among other things, that prayer exercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion. The concern may not be limited to the context of schools, but it is most pronounced there. What to most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable request that the nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the State to enforce a religious orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 592 (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurring opinions===

Justice Blackmun's concurrence stressed that "our decisions have gone beyond prohibiting coercion, however, because the Court has recognized that 'the fullest possible scope of religious liberty,' entails more than freedom from coercion."&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 606 (Blackmun, J., concurring; internal citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmun emphasized that the government was without power to place its imprimatur on any religious activity, even if no one was compelled to participate in a state-sponsored religious exercise, directly or indirectly.

Justice Souter devoted his concurring opinion to a historical analysis, rebutting the contention that the government could endorse nonsectarian prayers. He cited the writings of [[James Madison]] and pointed to the changing versions of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] that the First Congress considered, as opposed to the version which was eventually adopted. Souter, too, took issue with the school district's defense of non-coercive religious exercises, dismissing the position as without precedential authority.

===Dissenting opinion===
Justice Scalia's dissent argued against the coercion test:

:In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits invocations and benedictions at public school graduation ceremonies, the Court - with nary a mention that it is doing so - lays waste a tradition that is as old as public school graduation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of an even more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian prayer to God at public celebrations generally. As its instrument of destruction, the bulldozer of its social engineering, the Court invents a boundless, and boundlessly manipulable, test of psychological coercion.&lt;ref&gt;505 U.S. at 632 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia pointed to several historical examples of calling on divine guidance by American Presidents, including Washington's proclamation of the Thanksgiving holiday in 1789 and the inaugural addresses of both Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. He disputed the Court's contention that attendance at high school graduation ceremonies was effectively required as part of social norms, and also the conclusion that students were subtly coerced to stand for the rabbi's invocation. In Scalia's view, only official penalties for refusing to support or adhere to a particular religion created an Establishment Clause violation.

==Subsequent developments==

The coercion test is now used to determine the constitutionality of certain government actions under the Establishment Clause, along with the [[Lemon test]] and Justice O'Connor's [[Endorsement test|"endorsement or disapproval" test]]. The test "seeks to determine whether the state has applied coercive pressure on an individual to support or participate in religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Doe v. Elmbrook School Dist. |vol=687 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=840 |pinpoint= |court=[[7th Cir.]] |date=2012 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20120723121 |accessdate=2018-07-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad reading of the Establishment Clause won out, but it seems to have its greatest current application in a public school context. The Court has ruled against the separationist position in several key funding cases since ''Lee'', including the [[school voucher]] case ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Zelman v. Simmons-Harris|link=|volume=536|page=639|pin=|year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a majority of the Court continues to maintain a strict ban on most forms of state-sponsored religious exercises in schools themselves, as evidenced by the 6–3 ruling in ''[[Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe]]'', which struck down student-led prayers before public school football games.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe|link=|volume=530|page=290|pin=|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''literary estate''' of a deceased [[author]] consists mainly of the [[copyright]] and other [[intellectual property]] rights of published works, including [[film rights|film]], [[translation]] rights, original manuscripts of published work, unpublished or partially completed work, and papers of intrinsic literary interest such as correspondence or personal diaries and records. In [[academia]], the [[German language|German]] term ''[[Nachlass]]'' for the legacy of papers is often used.

==Literary executor==

A '''literary executor''' is a person acting on behalf of beneficiaries (e.g. family members, a designated charity, a research library or archive) under the author's '''[[Will and testament|will]]'''.  The executor is responsible for entering into contracts with publishers, collecting royalties, maintaining copyrights, and (where appropriate) arranging for the deposit of letters.  According to ''Wills, Administration and Taxation: a practical guide'' (1990, UK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barlow, J. S., King, L. C., King, A. G.|title=Wills, Administration and Taxation: a practical guide|date=1990|page=192|publisher=Sweet and Maxwell, London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA192 |accessdate=14 November 2014|isbn=9780421431003}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A will may appoint different executors to deal with different parts of the estate. One example of this is the appointment of a literary executor to deal with literary effects [...]".

Since the literary estate is a legacy to the author's [[heir]]s, the management of it in financial terms is a responsibility of trust. The position of literary [[executor]] extends beyond the monetary aspect, though: appointment to such a position, perhaps informally, is often a matter of the author's choice during his or her lifetime.

If a sympathetic and understanding friend is in the position of literary executor, there can be conflict: what is to be managed is not just a portfolio of intellectual property but a posthumous reputation. Wishes of the deceased author may have been clearly expressed but are not always respected. Family members often express strong feelings about privacy of the dead. For example, biographical writing is likely to be of a quite different authority if it is carried out with access to private papers. The literary executor then becomes a gatekeeper.

===Examples===
Examples of literary executors include Sir [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]] for [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Robert Baldwin Ross]] for [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Hayward Barlow]] for [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Rush Rhees]] for [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Otto Nathan]] for [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Regine Olsen]] for [[Søren Kierkegaard]].

A particularly notorious example is [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] for [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], as she resorted to fraud to make her brother's ''Nachlass'' more compatible with Nazi ideology.{{cn|date=February 2017}} An exceptionally productive example is that of [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Although he did not originally intend that the stenographs of his thousands of lectures be published, he relented and named his second wife, [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], to direct his ''Nachlass'', which has produced more than three hundred volumes since his death in 1925.

Older examples of such appointments, such as [[Kenelm Digby]] for [[Ben Jonson]], are essentially editorial rather than legal. A contemporary case is [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s work on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s papers.

A notable example is the case of [[Franz Kafka]], who left no will. His friend [[Max Brod]] assumed the function of literary executor, though most of the literary estate was legally owned by Marianne Steiner and Věra Saudková.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=94106|title=Pasley, Sir John Malcolm|first=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5999">The '''Milwaukee Project''' was a program begun in the 1960s designed to improve the [[IQ]]s and scholastic achievement of children at risk and to study the effects of intellectual stimulation on children from deprived environments.

==The Project==
Rick Heber of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] examined the statistics of districts in the city of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. His attention was drawn towards one district, where the residents had the lowest median income and lowest level of education in the city. The unemployment rate was also very high. Although this district contained only 3% of the city’s population, 33% of all children who had been labeled "mentally retarded" lived there.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Program==
Heber selected 40 newborns from this district. All had a mother with an IQ lower than 80. In many cases the father was absent. The newborns were randomly assigned to an experimental and a [[control group]]. Mothers of children in the experimental group received education, vocational rehabilitation, and training in homemaking and child care. The children were brought to infant stimulation centers, where they received a high quality educational program designed to develop language and cognitive skills. They also received three balanced meals a day. They stayed there five days a week, seven hours a day. When the children were six the program ended. The children then attended local schools. Both the experimental group and the control group were tested an equal number of times throughout the project.&lt;ref name=Edublox&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Genetics in IQ and Intelligence|url=http://iq-test.learninginfo.org/iq03.htm|work=Article|publisher=Edublox|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
According to Heber and colleagues, by age six all of the children from the experimental group had higher IQs than all of the children from the control group. Mean IQ was 120 in the experimental group and 87 in the control group. After the children left the program their IQs started declining. By the time both groups were ten years old the IQs of the children of the experimental group had decreased to 105. Mean IQ in the control group was 85.&lt;ref name=Edublox /&gt;

At age 14, the children in the experimental group had a mean IQ ten points above that of the control group, but the scholastic achievement scores of the experimental group were not better than those of the control group. Both groups performed in school as would be expected from children with a mean IQ of 80. For this reason, [[Arthur Jensen]] has suggested that the Milwaukee Project did not produce permanent intelligence gains, but that the IQ gains it showed were due to an indirect form of "[[teaching to the test]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1998, pp. 340–342&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The Milwaukee Project's claimed success was celebrated in the popular media and by famous psychologists. However, later in the project Rick Heber, the principal investigator, was discharged from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and convicted and imprisoned for large-scale abuse of federal funding for private gain. Two of Heber's colleagues in the project were also convicted for similar abuses. The project's results were not published in any refereed scientific journals, and Heber did not respond to requests from colleagues for raw data and technical details of the study. Consequently, even the existence of the project as described by Heber has been called into question. Nevertheless, many college textbooks in psychology and education have uncritically reported the project's results.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds &amp; Fletcher-Janzen 2001, pp. 462–463, 635–636&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Sommer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9600">The '''National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE)''' (pronounced: nessie) is a survey mechanism used to measure the level of student participation at [[University|universities]] and [[college]]s in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] as it relates to learning and engagement.'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/origins.cfm|title = Our Origins and Potential|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Center for Postsecondary Research - Indiana University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;''' The results of the survey help [[Academic administration|administrators]] and [[professor]]s to assess their students' [[student engagement]]. The survey targets first-year and senior students on campuses.  NSSE developed ten student Engagement Indicators (EIs) that are categorized in four general themes: academic challenge, learning with peers, experiences with faculty, and campus environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/engagement_indicators.cfm|title = Engagement Indicators|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, there have been over 1,600 colleges and universities that have opted to participate in the survey.  Additionally, approximately 5 million students within those institutions have completed the engagement survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/about.cfm|title = About NSSE|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Center for Postsecondary Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, NSSE assesses ''effective teaching'' practices ''and'' student engagement in educationally purposeful activities. The survey is administered and assessed by [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] [[School of education|School of Education]] Center for [[Postsecondary education|Postsecondary]] Research.

== History ==
The initial idea of the National Survey of Student Engagement centers on providing an alternative metric of evaluation for colleges and universities to measure “quality” on a national platform and it is designed specifically to gauge the extent of student engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/origins.cfm|title = Origins and Potential|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Center for Postsecondary Research - Indiana University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuh, G. D. (2001). The
National Survey of Student Engagement: Conceptual framework and overview of
psychometric properties. ''Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Center for
Postsecondary Research'', 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The NSSE was birthed in 1998 and financially supported by a grant from the [[The Pew Charitable Trusts|Pew Charitable Trusts]]. Much of the quality metrics according to the initial working group of higher education leaders that the Pew Charitable Trust organized concluded that there were few external incentives for institutions to partake in “''meaningful quality improvement''.” The quality concept as it relates to colleges and universities has largely been impacted by [[accrediting agencies]], government [[regulation]]s (e.g. licensure standards), and ''third-party'' rankings (''e.g.'' ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'') that focus on student selectivity and faculty [[credential]]s.  Nevertheless, these types of quality metrics do not give insight regarding the resources institutions invest to facilitate significant academic experiences/activities or effective instructional practices that demonstrate high-level of engagement and success in college&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Objectives ===
The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) contestably, serves as a tool for four-year institutions to gather data centered on institutional quality, ultimately to be used to improve undergraduate studies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;National Survey
of Student Engagement. (2014). ''Bringing the Institution into Focus—Annual
Results 2014.''Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Center for Postsecondary
Research.&lt;/ref&gt; This quality is measured by the energy that students spend engaging in meaningful educational experiences ( high-impact
practices) during college that have significantly impacted desired learning outcomes and overall student experiences, regardless of institutional type and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = What matters in college?

Institutions that align their resources to foster engagement potentially experience higher levels of quality– the marriage of purposeful engagement and institutional quality.&lt;ref&gt;Kuh, G.D.

Survey of Student Engagement. Change, 33(3), 10-17, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several identifiers that [[researchers]] have studied that draw parallels to student success among institutions; the survey provides colleges and universities with the student engagement data that show strengths and opportunities for growth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kuh, George D.

them, and why they matter.” AAC&amp;U, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student Engagement Defined ==
Students’ responses in the survey have been categorized into ten Engagement Indicators (EIs) and narrowly concentrated among four general themes: academic challenge, learning with
peers, experiences with faculty, and campus environment.  NSSEs ten Engagement Indicators include:higher-order learning, reflective and integrative learning, learning strategies, quantitative reasoning, learning with peers, discussions with diverse others, experiences with faculty, effective teaching practices, quality of interactions, and supportive environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, NSSE provides results on six High-Impact practices (HIPs) that are duly noted for their positive outcomes on ''student learning'' and ''retention.''&lt;ref&gt;National Survey
of Student Engagement. (2015). Engagement Indicators. Retrieved from National
Survey of Student Engagement :
&lt;nowiki&gt;http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/engagement_indicators.cfm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  These HIPs are known by researchers as educational experiences that shift one’s trajectory of success in college.  The HIPs refer to: learning community, service-learning, research with faculty (effective for first-year student and seniors), internship or field experience, study abroad, and culminating senior experience that seniors should engage in (e.g. capstone project).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/high_impact_practices.cfm|title = High-Impact Practices|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, George Kuh suggested that all students should experience at least one HIP during their first-year and one during senior year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These teaching and learning practices have been proven to be beneficial to
college students from various backgrounds.

== NSSE Survey- Outcomes ==
The survey offers an unconventional assessment for evaluating collegiate quality by collecting data that is used to depict institutional experiences and instructional practices that affects learning and college student success.  There are three envisioning principles for data collected by NSSE.  The first is to allow a vehicle for institutions to improve upon its undergraduate studies program (e.g. how the institution aligns with its strategic foci). Secondly, external agencies such as accrediting bodies and state agencies of higher education could use the information to gauge institutional effectiveness.  Lastly, the publication of results could be of interest to media outlets as a means of incorporating into college ranking metrics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Selected results ===
* ''While aggregate results generally reveal that underrepresented and'' underprepared students rate the quality of their interactions with others on campus lower relative to their peers, these groups evidenced no relative disadvantage at an appreciable subset of institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* ''Average levels of students’ experiences with faculty—effective'' teaching practices and student-faculty interaction—varied notably from one institution to the next, even when examined within selectivity strata.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* ''One in three first-year students rarely met with an advisor. The'' proportion who rarely sought advice was higher among commuting, nontraditional-aged, and part-time students—suggesting the need for special outreach efforts for such students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''opportunity trap''' is the social congestion in the competition for jobs when the number of applicants outstrips the demand for a particular group of workers – in particular, graduate school degree-holding applicants. It is distinct from the [[Equal opportunity|opportunity gap]] which refers to a lack of [[equal opportunity]]. An example of fields where the number of applicants far outstrips the available opportunities includes [[humanities]] [[professor]]s. Large numbers of graduate students complete [[PhD]] programs in [[English literature]], [[history]] and [[music history]], but there are only a handful of openings for professor positions. The PhD graduates who cannot find professor positions may experience [[underemployment]], such as working at a job which does not require their education (e.g., working at [[Starbucks]]).

==Overview==
Many commentators, including [[human capital]] theorists and proponents of positional consensus theory, assert that there is a tightening relationship between education, jobs and rewards, and that in general, the more qualifications you have, the more employable you are. These ideas have informed policies to widen access to educational opportunities with the goal of promoting equality and maximising efficiency according to [[meritocratic]] ideals. However, it can be argued that this perspective fails to take into account the positional nature of qualifications – that is, an individual’s chances of getting a certain job are dependent both on their own skills and qualifications, and the skills and qualifications of the other applicants and on the number of other qualified applicants. Qualifications have both an absolute and a relative value – which diminishes the more people hold them. For example, in a society where 50% of the working population hold university degrees, they will be less valuable than in a society where only 5% hold them.
==Academic inflation==
{{Main|Academic inflation}}
Taking this relative quality of qualifications into account, it can be argued that widening participation in higher education and qualifications will not necessarily deliver the rewards that human capital theorists have suggested, if the number of graduate degree-requiring jobs does not increase accordingly, and will instead lead to [[academic inflation]]:

:‘If only a few adopt the same tactics to get ahead, such as intensifying efforts to get into a top university, do volunteer work to add value to one’s resume, or work late to impress the boss, it stands a chance of success. But if everyone adopts the same tactics, then no one gets ahead; it simply raises the entry bar or increases the number of hurdles’  

According to this perspective, if everyone holds the same credentials no one gets ahead and the result is a kind of social congestion around sought-after jobs. [[Phillip Brown (sociologist)|Brown]] describes this as an "opportunity trap" since few individuals are able to opt out of the competition for jobs and are compelled to strive for credentials in order to be considered employable.  It is also argued that in this context of an increasing pool of graduate applicants, employers have been propelled to a stronger position of power as they are increasingly able to demand more from potential employees in a [[reverse auction]]. It has also been argued that this process has been exacerbated by [[offshoring]] and practices of [[Digital Taylorism]] in the workplace.

'''[[Education]]''' – in the general sense is any act or [[experience]] that has a formative effect on the [[mind]], [[Moral character|character]], or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] from one generation to another. Education can also be defined as the process of becoming an educated person.&lt;ref&gt;Don, Berg. "Definition of Education." teach-kids-attitude-1st.com. N.p., n.d.

== Educational philosophies ==
* Traditions in education
** [[Idealism]] – This tradition emerged in Greece and the famous philosophers who introduced this concept were Socrates and his pupil Plato. The basic concept launched was that all the things we see in this world are actually the copy not original.  What ever we produce here becomes an idea in our mind. So whatever we work to create something is first takes shape in ideas and minds, so the true reality is Idealism.They both supported an education which provides the opportunity to develop mental faculties and make student think properly to find any reality.
** [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] – Aristotle, the pupil of Plato was the person who got the concept of Realism and argued that the Idealism is not the only reality, but there are many natural things which are the part of our atmosphere and we come across those things. Whatever we observe is very important to work on and find the realities using empirical evidences. So the education that is based on experience and observable realities will guide the students to find out the reality. The same has relevance to the philosophy of Positivism.
** [[Educational perennialism|Perennialism]] – This concept was introduced by Robert Hutchins who was of a view that the education should have ever-lasting impact on the students and therefore the only ever-last ideas should be taught. for that he supported the religious concepts to be incorporated in the curriculum.
** [[Existentialism]] – Kierkegaard argued that all the philosophers are of a view to inculcate into the students which is something outdoor with reference to the students. He told that realities are subjective and they are with the individuals themselves. The education should work on individuals to harness the inner realities.
** [[Theism]] – Thomas Aquinas introduced the church doctrine in education and emphasized that reason and faith are complimentary so the both ideas should be the base of education and the students should go by the reasons introduced by the faith, church or religion.
** [[Essentialism]] – The education philosophies were taking many turns in the twentieth century when William Bagley raised his voice to attract the attention of the theoreticians telling that the education should have a core basics of the culture and heritage. The students should be given choice of study the said core subject and they should go to the 1930s education where the same was used to teach.
** [[Pragmatism]] – John Dewey was the person who told that in education a democratic view is to be implemented. Students should be given a chance to explore themselves and they should go by their own instinctive drives.
** [[Critical thinking]] – There was a team of German theoreticians like Adorno, Horkheimer and Habermas who gave the concept of Critical Theory and argued that the education which provides the students and prepare them to analyze the things under discussion, is the basic requirement of education.
** [[Social education]] – In his book, Social Education, Applied Perspective, Muhammad Zahid Azeem Zahid has argued that the education which provides the opportunity to the students to find their space in society and the education should be in line with the societal need not only individually but holistically as well. The Social Education Model is to be implemented in the third world countries as there is a big need to join the individual and society. An educated person can become a good professional and can lead a good life individually, but the need of the day is that he or she should keep his profession and the lifestyle favorable to the society as well....

=== Schools ===

* [[School]] – an institution designed for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education (commonly compulsory), in which students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. Non-compulsory higher education follows, and is taught in institutions called a college or university.

'''Overseas Student Health Care''' is a compulsory [[health insurance]] product required by [[international student]]s studying in [[Australia]]. OSHC is an insurance product that basically gives international students a level of insurance coverage that is based on the Australian [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] system. Overseas Student Health Cover is commonly referred to as OSHC. Students can arrange to pay for their OSHC through their educational institution. However, students can still choose their own OSHC provider even when their educational institution makes a specific recommendation because they have negotiated a preferred provider arrangement with a particular insurer.

== Deed ==

OSHC is only able to be offered by Australian private health insurers who have signed the Deed for the provision of Overseas Student Health Cover with the Australian government. The Deed outlines the conditions required to be met by the registered insurers in order to offer the OSHC product. A legal document between the Commonwealth of Australia and the relevant insurer, the Deed dictates the minimum benefits payable by the insurer, in addition to conditions for which it is not required to pay any benefits. 
In addition, clause 6.8 of the Deed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BB6090580215B214CA256F1900166600/$File/Template%20Overseas%20Student%20Health%20Cover%20Deed%20-%201%20July%202011.pdf | title=Template Overseas Student Health Cover Deed | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20130409180938/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BB6090580215B214CA256F1900166600/$File/Template%20Overseas%20Student%20Health%20Cover%20Deed%20-%201%20July%202011.pdf | archivedate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; stipulates the conditions under which the insurers can terminate policies and make refunds, specifically:

* Where the student decides not to come to Australia;
* Where the student has ceased studies and left Australia prior to the end of their visa;
* Where the student has had their application for an extended stay refused by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship;
* Where the student has been granted permanent residence;
* Where the student has been outside Australia for a period exceeding 3 months; or
* Where the student holds an OSHC from another insurer.

== Exceptions ==

OSHC is not needed if the student is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/stud/more/health-insurance-for-students | title=Health insurance for students | publisher=Department of Home Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a Norwegian student covered by the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme
* a Swedish student covered by the [[Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency]]
* a Belgian student covered under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia.

== Providers ==

As at 30 June 2013, there were 5 health insurers who are signatories to the Australian Government the Deed for the provision of Overseas Student Health Cover enabling them to offer OSHC. These insurers are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/overseas/oshc.htm|title=Overseas Student Health Cover|first=Private Health Insurance|last=Ombudsman|website=www.privatehealth.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paper Project''' is a fusion project that blends art, science, and technology into engaging 2D and 3D experiences.

==About the project==

The Paper Project is a multidimensional art and science project exploring the microscopic structure of paper using a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|scanning-laser confocal microscope]]. Created by artist and scientist Charles Kazilek and printer and paper maker Gene Valentine in 1999 the project has been exhibiting works in various formats including 2D and virtual 3D images. The 3D [[anaglyphic]] images make use of inexpensive red-blue [[Anaglyph 3D|3D glasses]] first introduced to movie goers in the 1950s. When wearing 3D glasses, it is as if the viewer has been reduced to the size of a period at the end of a sentence and is able to explore the invisible structure and beauty of paper.

In 2002, the project expanded to dance, collaborating with costume designers Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama.  The result of the collaboration was ''Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions'' that debuted at the American College Dance Festival. In 2004, Jennifer Tsukayama became a member of the Paper Project and the group created a traveling 3D immersive room based on the earlier dance performance. The first installation of the room was at the Arizona Museum for Youth.

Since its creation, images from the Paper Project have been viewed around the world in museums, science centers, and on the Web. In addition to exhibits the Paper Project has developed educational content that can be used to engage students in art, history, biology, chemistry, and physics.

The '''Programme for International Student Assessment''' ('''PISA''') is a worldwide study by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in member and non-member nations intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/|title=About PISA|website=OECD PISA|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first performed in 2000 and then repeated every three years. Its aim is to provide comparable data with a view to enabling countries to improve their education policies and outcomes. It measures problem solving and cognition. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Kathleen|title=Invitation to The Life Span|publisher=worth|isbn=978-1-4641-7205-2|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 version of the test was published on 6 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/pisa/launch-of-pisa-2015-results.htm|title=Launch of PISA 2015 Results|website=OECD PISA|accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and impact==
PISA, and similar international standardised assessments of educational attainment are increasingly used in the process of education policymaking at both national and international levels.&lt;ref name="Rey"&gt;Rey O, 'The use of external assessments and the impact on education systems' in CIDREE Yearbook 2010, accessed January 2017 at http://www.cidree.org/publications/yearbook_2010?PHPSESSID=baip221utd9v77b89hov0s3al6&lt;/ref&gt;

PISA was conceived to set in a wider context the information provided by national monitoring of education system performance through regular assessments within a common, internationally agreed framework; by investigating relationships between student learning and other factors they can "offer insights into sources of variation in performances within and between countries".&lt;ref name="McGaw"&gt;McGaw, B (2008) 'The role of the OECD in international comparative studies of achievement' Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice, 15:3, 223-243&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1990s, few European countries used national tests. In the 1990s, ten countries / regions introduced standardised assessment, and since the early 2000s, ten more followed suit. By 2009, only five European education systems had no national student assessments.&lt;ref name="Rey"/&gt;

The impact of these international standardised assessments in the field of educational policy has been significant, in terms of the creation of ''new knowledge'', changes in ''assessment policy'', and ''external influence over national educational policy'' more broadly.

===Creation of new knowledge===
Data from international standardised assessments can be useful in research on causal factors within or across education systems.&lt;ref name="Rey"/&gt; Mons notes that the databases generated by large-scale international assessments have made possible the carrying out, on an unprecedented scale, of inventories and comparisons of education systems in more than 40 countries and on themes ranging from the conditions for learning in mathematics and reading, to institutional autonomy and admissions policies.&lt;ref name="Mons"&gt;Mons N, (2008) 'Évaluation des politiques éducatives et comparaisons internationales', Revue française de pédagogie, 164, juillet-août-septembre 2008 5-13&lt;/ref&gt; They allow typologies to be developed that can be used for comparative statistical analyses of education performance indicators, thereby identifying the consequences of different policy choices. They have generated new knowledge about education: PISA findings have challenged deeply embedded educational practices, such as the early tracking of students into vocational or academic pathways.&lt;ref name="Breaks"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breakspear |first=S. |title=The Policy Impact of PISA: An Exploration of the Normative Effects of International Benchmarking in School System Performance |journal=OECD Education Working Paper |volume=71 |date=2012 |doi=10.1787/5k9fdfqffr28-en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barroso and de Carvalho find that PISA provides a common reference connecting academic research in education and the political realm of public policy, operating as a mediator between different strands of knowledge from the realm of education and public policy.&lt;ref name="Barroso"&gt;Barroso, J. and de Carvalho, L.M. (2008) 'Pisa: Un instrument de régulation pour relier des mondes', Revue française de pédagogie, 164, 77–80&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the key findings from comparative assessments are widely shared in the research community&lt;ref name="Rey"/&gt; the knowledge they create does not necessarily fit with government reform agendas; this leads to some inappropriate uses of assessment data.

===Changes in national assessment policy===
Emerging research suggests that international standardised assessments are impacting upon national assessment policy and practice. PISA is being integrated in national policies and practices on assessment, evaluation, curriculum standards and performance targets; its assessment frameworks and instruments are being used as best-practice models for improving national assessments; many countries have explicitly incorporated and emphasise PISA-like competencies in revised national standards and curricula; others use PISA data to complement national data and validate national results against an international benchmark.&lt;ref name="Breaks"/&gt;

===External influence over national educational policy===

More important than its influence on countries' policy of student assessment, is the range of ways in which PISA is influencing countries education policy choices.

Policy-makers in most participating countries see PISA as an important indicator of system performance; PISA reports can define policy problems and set the agenda for national policy debate; policymakers seem to accept PISA as a valid and reliable instrument for internationally benchmarking system performance and changes over time; most countries—irrespective of whether they performed above, at, or below the average PISA score—have begun policy reforms in response to PISA reports.&lt;ref name="Breaks"/&gt;

Against this, it should be noted that impact on national education systems varies markedly. For example, in Germany, the results of the first PISA assessment caused the so-called 'PISA shock': a questioning of previously accepted educational policies; in a state marked by jealously guarded regional policy differences, it led ultimately to an agreement by all Länder to introduce common national standards and even an institutionalised structure to ensure that they were observed.&lt;ref name="Ertl"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ertl |first=H. |year=2006 |title=Educational standards and the changing discourse on education: the reception and consequences of the PISA study in Germany |journal=Oxford Review of Education |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=619–634 |doi=10.1080/03054980600976320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, by comparison, which shared similar conditions to Germany, PISA results have not led to significant changes in educational policy.&lt;ref name="Bajomi"&gt;Bajomi, I., Berényi, E., Neumann, E. and Vida, J. (2009). 'The Reception of PISA in Hungary' accessed January 2017 at http://www.knowandpol.eu/IMG/pdf/pisa.wp12.hungary.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many countries have set national performance targets based on their relative rank or absolute PISA score, PISA assessments have increased the influence of their (non-elected) commissioning body, the OECD, as an international education monitor and policy actor, which implies an important degree of 'policy transfer' from the international to the national level; PISA in particular is having "an influential normative effect on the direction of national education policies".&lt;ref name="Breaks"/&gt; Thus, it is argued that the use of international standardised assessments has led to a shift towards international, external accountability for national system performance; Rey contends that PISA surveys, portrayed as objective, third-party diagnoses of education systems, actually serve to promote specific orientations on educational issues.&lt;ref name="Rey"/&gt;

National policy actors refer to high-performing PISA countries to "help legitimise and justify their intended reform agenda within contested national policy debates".&lt;ref name="Break"&gt;Steiner-Khamsi (2003), cited by {{cite journal |last=Breakspear |first=S. |title=The Policy Impact of PISA: An Exploration of the Normative Effects of International Benchmarking in School System Performance |work=OECD Education Working Paper |volume=71 |date=2012 |doi=10.1787/5k9fdfqffr28-en }}&lt;/ref&gt; PISA data can be are "used to fuel long-standing debates around pre-existing conflicts or rivalries between different policy options, such as in the French Community of Belgium".&lt;ref name="Mang"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mangez |first1=Eric |last2=Cattonar |first2=Branka |format=PDF |url=https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal%3A71171/datastream/PDF_01/view |title=The status of PISA in the relationship between civil society and the educational sector in French-speaking Belgium|journal=Sísifo: Educational Sciences Journal|publisher=Educational Sciences R&amp;D Unit of the University of Lisbon|issue=10|date=September-December 2009|issn=1646-6500|pages=15–26|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances, PISA assessment data are used selectively: in public discourse governments often only use superficial features of PISA surveys such as country rankings and not the more detailed analyses. Rey (2010:145, citing Greger, 2008) notes that often the real results of PISA assessments are ignored as policymakers selectively refer to data in order to legitimise policies introduced for other reasons.&lt;ref name="Greger"&gt;Greger, D. (2008). 'Lorsque PISA importe peu. Le cas de la République Tchèque et de l'Allemagne', Revue française de pédagogie, 164, 91–98. cited in Rey O, 'The use of external assessments and the impact on education systems' in CIDREE Yearbook 2010, accessed January 2017 at http://www.cidree.org/publications/yearbook_2010?PHPSESSID=baip221utd9v77b89hov0s3al6&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, PISA's international comparisons can be used to justify reforms with which the data themselves have no connection; in Portugal, for example, PISA data were used to justify new arrangements for teacher assessment (based on inferences that were not justified by the assessments and data themselves); they also fed the government's discourse about the issue of pupils repeating a year, (which, according to research, fails to improve student results).&lt;ref name="Alfons"&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last1=Afonso|first1=Natércio|last2=Costa|first2=Estela|url=http://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/5667/2/Afonso%20%26%20Costa%20(2009).%20ENG%20D4.pdf|title=The influence of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) on policy decision in Portugal: the education policies of the 17th Portuguese Constitutional Government|journal=Sísifo: Educational Sciences Journal|publisher=Educational Sciences R&amp;D Unit of the University of Lisbon|issue=10|date=September-December 2009|issn=1646-6500|pages=53–64|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland, the country's PISA results (that are in other countries deemed to be excellent) were used by Ministers to promote new policies for 'gifted' students.&lt;ref name="Raut"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rautalin |first=M. |last2=Alasuutari |year=2009 |title=The uses of the national PISA results by Finnish officials in central government |journal=Journal of Education Policy |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=539–556 |doi=10.1080/02680930903131267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such uses and interpretations often assume causal relationships that cannot legitimately be based upon PISA data which would normally require fuller investigation through qualitative in-depth studies and longitudinal surveys based on mixed quantitative and qualitative methods,&lt;ref name="Egel"&gt;Egelund, N. (2008). 'The value of international comparative studies of achievement – a Danish perspective', Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice, 15, 3, 245–251&lt;/ref&gt; which politicians are often reluctant to fund.

Recent decades have witnessed an expansion in the uses to which PISA and similar assessments are put, from assessing students' learning, to connecting "the educational realm (their traditional remit) with the political realm".&lt;ref name="Rey2"&gt;Behrens, 2006 cited in Rey O, 'The use of external assessments and the impact on education systems' in CIDREE Yearbook 2010, accessed January 2017 at http://www.cidree.org/publications/yearbook_2010?PHPSESSID=baip221utd9v77b89hov0s3al6&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the question whether PISA data are sufficiently robust to bear the weight of the major policy decisions that are being based upon them, for, according to Breakspear, PISA data have "come to increasingly shape, define and evaluate the key goals of the national / federal education system".&lt;ref name="Breaks"/&gt; This implies that those who set the PISA tests – e.g. in choosing the content to be assessed and not assessed – are in a position of considerable power to set the terms of the education debate, and to orient educational reform in many countries around the globe.&lt;ref name="Breaks"/&gt;

==Framework==
PISA stands in a tradition of international school studies, undertaken since the late 1950s by the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] (IEA). Much of PISA's methodology follows the example of the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS, started in 1995), which in turn was much influenced by the U.S. [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP). The reading component of PISA is inspired by the IEA's [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).

PISA aims at testing [[literacy]] in three competence fields: reading, mathematics, science on a 1000-point scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hefling|first=Kimberly|title=Asian nations dominate international test|url=https://news.yahoo.com/asian-nations-dominate-international-test-100159386.html|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PISA mathematics literacy test asks students to apply their mathematical knowledge to solve problems set in real-world contexts. To solve the problems students must activate a number of mathematical competencies as well as a broad range of mathematical content knowledge. TIMSS, on the other hand, measures more traditional classroom content such as an understanding of fractions and decimals and the relationship between them (curriculum attainment). PISA claims to measure education's application to real-life problems and lifelong learning (workforce knowledge).

In the reading test, "OECD/PISA does not measure the extent to which 15-year-old students are fluent readers or how competent they are at word recognition tasks or spelling." Instead, they should be able to "construct, extend and reflect on the meaning of what they have read across a wide range of continuous and non-continuous texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/38/52/33707212.pdf |title=Chapter 2 of the publication 'PISA 2003 Assessment Framework' |format=pdf |publisher=Pisa.oecd.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
PISA is sponsored, governed, and coordinated by the OECD, but paid for by participating countries.

==Method of testing==

===Sampling===
The students tested by PISA are aged between 15 years and 3 months and 16 years and 2 months at the beginning of the assessment period. The school year pupils are in is not taken into consideration. Only students at school are tested, not home-schoolers. In PISA 2006, however, several countries also used a grade-based sample of students. This made it possible to study how age and school year interact.

To fulfill OECD requirements, each country must draw a sample of at least 5,000 students. In small countries like [[Iceland]] and [[Luxembourg]], where there are fewer than 5,000 students per year, an entire age cohort is tested. Some countries used much larger samples than required to allow comparisons between regions.

===Test===
[[File:Pisatest.jpg|thumb|PISA test documents on a school table (Neues Gymnasium, Oldenburg, Germany, 2006)]]

Each student takes a two-hour handwritten test. Part of the test is multiple-choice and part involves fuller answers. There are six and a half hours of assessment material, but each student is not tested on all the parts. Following the cognitive test, participating students spend nearly one more hour answering a questionnaire on their background including learning habits, motivation, and family. School directors fill in a questionnaire describing school demographics, funding, etc. In 2012 the participants were, for the first time in the history of large-scale testing and assessments, offered a new type of problem, i.e. interactive (complex) problems requiring exploration of a novel virtual device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oecdinsights.org/2014/04/01/pisa-we-have-a-problem/ Keeley B. PISA, we have a problem…] OECD Insights, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2432598 Poddiakov A.N. Complex Problem Solving at PISA 2012 and PISA 2015: Interaction with Complex Reality]. // Translated from Russian. Reference to the original Russian text: Poddiakov, A. (2012.) Reshenie kompleksnykh problem v PISA-2012 i PISA-2015: vzaimodeistvie so slozhnoi real'nost'yu. Obrazovatel'naya Politika, 6, 34-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In selected countries, PISA started experimentation with [[computer adaptive testing]].

===National add-ons===
Countries are allowed to combine PISA with complementary national tests.

Germany does this in a very extensive way: On the day following the international test, students take a national test called PISA-E (E=Ergänzung=complement). Test items of PISA-E are closer to TIMSS than to PISA. While only about 5,000 German students participate in the international and the national test, another 45,000 take only the latter. This large sample is needed to allow an analysis by federal states. Following a clash about the interpretation of 2006 results, the OECD warned Germany that it might withdraw the right to use the "PISA" label for national tests.&lt;ref&gt;C. Füller: ''Pisa hat einen kleinen, fröhlichen Bruder.'' taz, 5.12.2007 [http://www.taz.de/nc/1/archiv/print-archiv/printressorts/digi-artikel/?ressort=bi&amp;dig=2007%2F12%2F05%2Fa0140&amp;src=GI&amp;cHash=f350b212d5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data scaling===
From the beginning, PISA has been designed with one particular method of data analysis in mind. Since students work on different test booklets, raw scores must be 'scaled' to allow meaningful comparisons. Scores are thus scaled so that the OECD average in each domain (mathematics, reading and science) is 500 and the [[standard deviation]] is 100.&lt;ref name=stanat2002pisa&gt;{{citation|title = PISA 2000: Overview of the study—Design, method and results|last1 = Stanat|first1 = P|last2 = Artelt|first2 = C|last3 = Baumert|first3 = J |last4 = Klieme|first4 = E|last5 = Neubrand|first5 = M|last6 = Prenzel|first6 = M|last7 = Schiefele|first7 = U|last8 = Schneider|first8 = W|place = Berlin|publisher = Max Planck Institute for Human Development|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true only for the initial PISA cycle when the scale was first introduced, though, subsequent cycles are linked to the previous cycles through IRT scale linking methods.&lt;ref name = Mazzeo2013etal&gt;{{citation|title = Linking Scales in International Large-Scale Assessments, chapter 10 in Rutkowski, L. von Davier, M. &amp; Rutkowski, D.

This generation of proficiency estimates is done using a latent regression extension of the [[Rasch model]], a model of [[item response theory]] (IRT), also known as conditioning model or population model. The proficiency estimates are provided in the form of so-called plausible values, which allow unbiased estimates of differences between groups. The latent regression, together with the use of a Gaussian [[prior probability]] distribution of student competencies allows estimation of the proficiency distributions of groups of participating students.&lt;ref name="vonDavierM2013etal"&gt;{{citation|title = Analytics in International Large-Scale Assessments: Item Response Theory and Population Models, chapter 7 in Rutkowski, L. von Davier, M. &amp; Rutkowski, D.

Handbook of International Large-Scale Assessment: Background, Technical Issues, and Methods of Data Analysis.|last1 = von Davier|first1 = Matthias|last2 = Sinharay|first2 = Sandip|place = New York|publisher = Chapman and Hall/CRC.|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scaling and conditioning procedures are described in nearly identical terms in the Technical Reports of PISA 2000, 2003, 2006. NAEP and TIMSS use similar scaling methods.

==Results==

All PISA results are tabulated by country; recent PISA cycles have separate provincial or regional results for some countries. Most public attention concentrates on just one outcome: the mean scores of countries and their rankings of countries against one another. In the official reports, however, country-by-country rankings are given not as simple league tables but as cross tables indicating for each pair of countries whether or not mean score differences are [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] (unlikely to be due to random fluctuations in student sampling or in item functioning). In favorable cases, a difference of 9 points is sufficient to be considered significant.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

PISA never combines mathematics, science and reading domain scores into an overall score. However, commentators have sometimes combined test results from all three domains into an overall country ranking. Such meta-analysis is not endorsed by the OECD, although official summaries sometimes use scores from a testing cycle's principal domain as a proxy for overall student ability.

=== China ===
China's participation in the 2012 test was limited to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macau as separate entities. In 2012, Shanghai participated for the second time, again topping the rankings in all three subjects, as well as improving scores in the subjects compared to the 2009 tests. Shanghai's score of 613 in mathematics was 113 points above the average score, putting the performance of Shanghai pupils about 3 school years ahead of pupils in average countries. Educational experts debated to what degree this result reflected the quality of the general educational system in China, pointing out that Shanghai has greater wealth and better-paid teachers than the rest of China.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Phillips (3 December 2013) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/10490225/OECD-education-report-Shanghais-formula-is-world-beating.html OECD education report: Shanghai's formula is world-beating] [[Telegraph.co.uk|The Telegraph]]. Retrieved 8 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong placed second in reading and science and third in maths.

China is expected to participate in 2018 as an entire unit. In 2015, four provinces [[Jiangsu]], [[Guangdong]], Beijing, and Shanghai, with a total population of over 230 million, participated as a single entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-28937662|title=Pisa tests to include many more Chinese pupils|first=Sean|last=Coughlan|date=26 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2016-12/06/content_27592810.htm|title=Asia dominates world education rankings|work=China Daily|author=Harvey Morris|date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2016-12/07/content_27612583.htm|title=China's students fall in rank on assessment test|author=Amy He|work=China Daily|date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Beijing-Shanghai-Jiangsu-Guangdong cohort scored a median 518 in science in 2015, while the 2012 Shanghai cohort scored a median 580.

Critics of PISA counter that in Shanghai and other Chinese cities, most children of migrant workers can only attend city schools up to the ninth grade, and must return to their parents' hometowns for high school due to [[hukou system|hukou]] restrictions, thus skewing the composition of the city's high school students in favor of wealthier local families. A population chart of Shanghai reproduced in ''[[The New York Times]]'' shows a steep drop off in the number of 15-year-olds residing there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/shanghai-test-scores-and-the-mystery-of-the-missing-children/  Helen Gao, "Shanghai Test Scores and the Mystery of the Missing Children", ''New York Times'', January 23, 2014.] For Schleicher's initial response to these criticisms see his post, [http://oecdeducationtoday.blogspot.com/2013/12/are-chinese-cheating-in-pisa-or-are-we.html  "Are the Chinese Cheating in PISA Or Are We Cheating Ourselves?" on the OECD's website blog, ''Education Today'', December 10, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schleicher, 27% of Shanghai's 15-year-olds are excluded from its school system (and hence from testing). As a result, the percentage of Shanghai's 15-year-olds tested by PISA was 73%, lower than the 89% tested in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2014/03/05/more-than-a-quarter-of-shanghai-pupils-missed-by-pisa.aspx |title=William Stewart, "More than a quarter of Shanghai pupils missed by international Pisa rankings", ''Times Educational Supplement'', March 6, 2014. |access-date=7 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315122619/http://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2014/03/05/more-than-a-quarter-of-shanghai-pupils-missed-by-pisa.aspx |archive-date=15 March 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the 2015 testing, OECD published in depth studies on the education systems of a selected few countries including China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/china/Education-in-China-a-snapshot.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
Finland, which received several top positions in the first tests, fell in all three subjects in 2012, but remained the best performing country overall in Europe, achieving their best result in science with 545 points (5th) and worst in mathematics with 519 (12th) in which the country was outperformed by four other European countries. The drop in mathematics was 25 points since 2003, the last time mathematics was the focus of the tests. For the first time Finnish girls outperformed boys in the subject, but only narrowly. It was also the first time pupils in Finnish-speaking schools did not perform better than pupils in [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] schools. Minister of Education and Science [[Krista Kiuru]] expressed concern for the overall drop, as well as the fact that the number of low-performers had increased from 7% to 12%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jyu.fi/en/news/archive/2013/12/tiedote-2013-12-03-13-00-33-394036 PISA 2012: Proficiency of Finnish youth declining] [[University of Jyväskylä]]. Retrieved 9 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
India participated in the 2009 round of testing but pulled out of the 2012 PISA testing, in August 2012, with the Indian government attributing its action to the unfairness of PISA testing to Indian students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hemali Chhapia, TNN |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-03/mumbai/33019239_1_india-backs-global-stage-math-and-science |title=India backs out of global education test for 15-year-olds |work=The Times of India |date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Express reported on 9/3/2012 that "The ministry (of education) has concluded that there was a socio-cultural disconnect between the questions and Indian students. The ministry will write to the OECD and drive home the need to factor in India's "socio-cultural milieu". India's participation in the next PISA cycle will hinge on this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/poor-pisa-score-govt-blames--disconnect--with-india/996890/ |title=Poor PISA score: Govt blames 'disconnect' with India |work=The Indian Express |date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Express also noted that "Considering that over 70 nations participate in PISA, it is uncertain whether an exception would be made for India".

India did not participate in the 2012 and 2015 PISA rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/India-chickens-out-of-international-students-assessment-programme-again/articleshow/20375670.cms |title=India chickens out of international students assessment programme again |work=The Times of India |date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan]] (KVS) committee as well as a group of secretaries on education constituted by the [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Narendra Modi]] recommended that India should participate in PISA program. Accordingly, in February 2017, [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], under [[Prakash Javadekar]] decided to end the boycott and participate in PISA 2021. To address the socio-cultural disconnect between the test questions and students, it was reported that the OECD will update some questions. For example: the word avocado in a question may be replaced with a more popular Indian fruit such as mango.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PISA Tests: India to take part in global teen learning test in 2021|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/education/pisa-tests-india-to-take-part-in-global-teen-learning-test-in-2021-4537231/|accessdate=19 May 2018|work=The Indian Express|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In 2015, the results from Malaysia were found by the OECD to have not met the minimum response rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/12/08/ong-did-ministry-try-to-rig-results-for-pisa-2015-report/|title=Ong: Did ministry try to rig results for Pisa 2015 report?|date=8 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition politician [[Ong Kian Ming]] said the education ministry tried to oversample high-performing students in rich schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/365674|title=Who's telling the truth about M'sia's Pisa 2015 scores?|date=9 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooladvisor.my/news/malaysian-pisa-results-scrutiny-lack-evidence/|title=Malaysian PISA results under scrutiny for lack of evidence - School Advisor|date=8 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
Sweden's result dropped in all three subjects in the 2012 test, which was a continuation of a trend from 2006 and 2009. In mathematics, the nation had the sharpest fall in mathematic performance over 10 years among the countries that have participated in all tests, with a drop in score from 509 in 2003 to 478 in 2012. The score in reading showed a drop from 516 in 2000 to 483 in 2012. The country performed below the OECD average in all three subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Näslund (3 December 2013) [http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/svenska-skolan-rasar-i-stor-jamforelse/ Svenska skolan rasar i stor jämförelse] ''[[Expressen]]''. Retrieved 4 December 2013 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the opposition, [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrat]] [[Stefan Löfven]], described the situation as a national crisis.&lt;ref name=sl&gt;Jens Kärrman (3 December 2013) [http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/lofven-om-pisa-nationell-kris/ Löfven om Pisa: Nationell kris] ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''. Retrieved 8 December 2013 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the party's spokesperson on education, [[Ibrahim Baylan]], he pointed to the downward trend in reading as most severe.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the 2012 test, as in 2009, the result was slightly above average for the United Kingdom, with the science ranking being highest (20).&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{citation|first = Richard|last = Adams|date = 2013-12-03|url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/03/uk-students-education-oecd-pisa-report|title = UK students stuck in educational doldrums, OECD study finds|publisher = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate = 2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] also participated as separated entities, showing the worst result for Wales which in mathematics was 43 of the 65 countries and economies. Minister of Education in Wales [[Huw Lewis]] expressed disappointment in the results, said that there were no "quick fixes", but hoped that several educational reforms that have been implemented in the last few years would give better results in the next round of tests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25196974 Pisa ranks Wales' education the worst in the UK] [[BBC]]. 3 December 2013. Retrieved 4 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom had a greater gap between high- and low-scoring students than the average.  There was little difference between public and private schools when adjusted for [[socio-economic]] background of students. The gender difference in favour of girls was less than in most other countries, as was the difference between natives and immigrants.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt;

Writing in the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'', [[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard]] warned against putting too much emphasis on the UK's international ranking, arguing that an overfocus on scholarly performances in East Asia might have contributed to the area's low [[birthrate]], which he argued could harm the economic performance in the future more than a good PISA score would outweigh.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Evans-Pritchard (3 December 2013) [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100026127/oecd-educational-report-pisa-fever-is-causing-east-asias-demographic-collapse/ Ambrose Evans-Pritchard] [[Telegraph.co.uk]]. Retrieved 4 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' (TES) published an article, "Is PISA Fundamentally Flawed?" by William Stewart, detailing serious critiques of PISA's conceptual foundations and methods advanced by statisticians at major universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6344672 William Stewart, "Is Pisa fundamentally flawed?" ''Times Educational Supplement'', July 26, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article, Professor [[Harvey Goldstein]] of the [[University of Bristol]] was quoted as saying that when the OECD tries to rule out questions suspected of bias, it can have the effect of "smoothing out" key differences between countries. "That is leaving out many of the important things," he warned. "They simply don't get commented on. What you are looking at is something that happens to be common. But (is it) worth looking at? PISA results are taken at face value as providing some sort of common standard across countries. But as soon as you begin to unpick it, I think that all falls apart."

[[Queen's University Belfast]] mathematician Dr. Hugh Morrison stated that he found the statistical model underlying PISA to contain a fundamental, insoluble mathematical error that renders Pisa rankings "valueless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison|first=Hugh|format=PDF|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEducation/AboutUs/Staff/Academic/DrHughMorrison/Filestore/Filetoupload,387514,en.pdf|title=A fundamental conundrum in psychology's standard model of measurement and its consequences for PISA global rankings|year=2013|accessdate=13 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605225916/http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEducation/AboutUs/Staff/Academic/DrHughMorrison/Filestore/Filetoupload,387514,en.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein remarked that Dr. Morrison's objection highlights "an important technical issue" if not a "profound conceptual error". However, Goldstein cautioned that PISA has been "used inappropriately", contending that some of the blame for this "lies with PISA itself. I think it tends to say too much for what it can do and it tends not to publicise the negative or the weaker aspects." Professors Morrison and Goldstein expressed dismay at the OECD's response to criticism. Morrison said that when he first published his criticisms of PISA in 2004 and also personally queried several of the OECS's "senior people" about them, his points were met with "absolute silence" and have yet to be addressed. "I was amazed at how unforthcoming they were," he told TES. "That makes me suspicious." "Pisa steadfastly ignored many of these issues," he says. "I am still concerned."&lt;ref name="Stewart 2013"&gt;Stewart, "Is PISA fundamentally flawed?" ''TES'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Kreiner{{who|date=December 2016}} agreed: "One of the problems that everybody has with PISA is that they don't want to discuss things with people criticising or asking questions concerning the results. They didn't want to talk to me at all. I am sure it is because they can't defend themselves.&lt;ref name="Stewart 2013"/&gt;

===United States===

Since 2012 a few states have participated in the PISA tests as separate entities. Only the 2012 and 2015 results are available on a state basis. Puerto Rico participated in 2015 as a separate US entity as well.

==Research on possible causes of PISA disparities in different countries==

The '''Pupil Achievement Tracker (PAT)''' is a [[pupil tracking system]] produced by the [[DfES]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schools.bedfordshire.gov.uk/im/PAT/index.htm Pupil Assessment Tracker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701064153/http://www.schools.bedfordshire.gov.uk/im/pat/index.htm |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It allows schools and LEAs to import their own pupil performance data and compare it with national performance data.

As part of the [[New Relationship with Schools]], [[Ofsted]] and [[DfES]] are streamlining data analysis in schools by merging [[Performance and Assessment (PANDA)|PANDA]] with PAT to produce new online product called RAISEOnline.

'''Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self-Evaluation (RAISE)'''

RAISEonline&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.raiseonline.org RAISEonline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a new web-based system which disseminates [[school performance data]] and will replace the current [[Ofsted]] [[Performance and Assessment (PANDA)]] reports and the DfES Pupil Achievement Tracker (PAT) in 2007 to coincide with the availability of 2006 validated [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] data.

The '''Reggio Emilia approach''' is an educational philosophy focused on [[preschool]] and [[primary education]].  It is a [[pedagogy]] described as [[student-centered learning|student-centered]] and [[constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] that utilizes self-directed, [[experiential learning]] in relationship-driven environments.  The program is based on the principles of respect, responsibility, and community through exploration and discovery through a self-guided [[curriculum]].  At its core is an assumption that children form their own personality during early years of development and are endowed with "a hundred languages", through which they can express their ideas. The aim of the Reggio approach is to teach how to use these symbolic languages (e.g., painting, sculpting, drama) in everyday life.  It was developed after [[World War II]] by psychologist Loris Malaguzzi and parents in the villages around [[Reggio Emilia]], Italy, and derives its name from the city.

==History==
During the post-[[World War II]] era in Italy, the “…desire to bring change and create anew"&lt;ref name=Hewitt/&gt; accompanied great economic and social development, including in education.&lt;ref name=NAREA&gt;{{cite web |title=North American Reggio Emilia Alliance |url=http://www.reggioalliance.org |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s Malaguzzi’s method was known and appreciated by many educators especially thanks to the first exhibit opened at the Modern Museet in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. In Italy, the [[National Group for Work and Study on Infant Toddler Centers]] was formed.

On May 24, 1994, the non-profit organization [[Friends of Reggio Children International Association]] was founded to promote the work of Loris Malaguzzi and organize professional development and cultural events.&lt;ref name="Friends of Reggio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends of Reggio Children International Association|url=http://zerosei.comune.re.it/inter/amici.htm|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In November 2002, during the annual conference of the National Association for the Education of Young Children in Chicago, the North American Reggio Emilia Alliance was formally launched as an organization.&lt;ref name=NAREA /&gt;

In 2003 the municipality of Reggio Emilia chose to manage the system and the network of school services and toddler centers by forming the ''Istituzione Scuole e Nidi d'Infanzia''.  This allowed municipal schools and preschools to have independent programs and activities with support from the government.

In February 2006, the [[Reggio Children Foundation|Loris Malaguzzi International Centre]] opened in Reggio Emilia, Italy, as a meeting place for professional development and research of the Reggio philosophy.  On September 29, 2011, the non-profit Reggio Children-Loris Malaguzzi Centre Foundation was officially established at the Loris Malaguzzi International Centre with the aim of fostering “education and research to improve the lives of people and communities, in Reggio Emilia and in the world”.&lt;ref name="Reggio Children Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fondazione Reggio Children Centro Loris Malaguzzi|url=http://reggiochildrenfoundation.org|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
The Reggio Emilia philosophy is based upon the following set of principles: 
*[[Child]]ren must have some control over the direction of their learning; 
*Children must be able to learn through experiences of touching, moving, listening, and observing; 
*Children have a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with other children and with material items in the world that they must be allowed to explore;
*Children must have endless ways and opportunities to express themselves.

The Reggio Emilia approach to teaching young children puts the natural [[development of children]] as well as the close relationships that they share with their environment at the center of its philosophy. The foundation of the Reggio Emilia approach lies in its unique view of the child: to foster education in the youngest learners to promote the best possible integration among children’s "100 languages".&lt;ref name="A Hundred Languages"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Hundred|url=http://www.childrenfirstschool.org/cf.php?id=childrenC&amp;t=100%20Languages|accessdate=28 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001540/http://www.childrenfirstschool.org/cf.php?id=childrenC&amp;t=100%20Languages|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, there is a belief that children have rights and should be given opportunities to develop their potential. Children are considered to be “knowledge bearers”, so they are encouraged to share their thoughts and ideas about everything they could meet or do during the day.
“Influenced by this belief, the child is beheld as beautiful, powerful, competent, creative, curious, and full of potential and ambitious desires."&lt;ref name=Hewitt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hewitt|first=Valarie|title=Examining the Reggio Emilia Approach to Early Childhood Education|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|date=2001|volume=29|issue=2|pages=95–100|doi=10.1023/A:1012520828095}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The child is viewed as being an active constructor of knowledge.  Rather than being seen as the target of instruction, children are seen as having the active role of an apprentice.&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Lilian|title=The Hundred Languages of Children: The Reggio Emilia Approach to Early Childhood Education|year=1993|publisher=Ablex Publishing Corporation|location=Norwood, NJ|pages=19–37|authorlink=What can we learn from Reggio Emilia?|editor=Edwards, C. |editor2=Gandini, L. |editor3=Forman, G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This role also extends to that of a researcher.  Much of the instruction at Reggio Emilia schools takes place in the form of projects where they have opportunities to explore, observe, hypothesize, question, and discuss to clarify their understanding.&lt;ref name=Forman&gt;{{cite book|last=Forman|first=G.|title=Constructivism: Theory, Perspectives, and Practice|year=1996|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0807734889|pages=172–181|authorlink=The project approach in Reggio Emilia|editor=Fosnot, CT }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Children are also viewed as social beings and a focus is made on the child in relation to other children, the family, the teachers, and the community rather than on each child in isolation.&lt;ref name=Gandini&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gandini|first=L.|title=Fundamentals of the Reggio Emilia Approach to Early Childhood Education|journal=Young Children|date=1993|volume=49|issue=1|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are taught that respect for everyone else is important because everyone is a “subjective agency ” while existing as part of a group.

Reggio Emilia's approach to early education reflects a theoretical kinship with [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Vygotsky]] and [[Jerome Bruner]], among others. Much of what occurs in the class reflects a [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] approach to early education. Reggio Emilia's approach does challenge some conceptions of teacher competence and developmentally appropriate practice. For example, teachers in Reggio Emilia assert the importance of being confused as a contributor to learning; thus a major teaching strategy is purposely to allow mistakes to happen, or to begin a project with no clear sense of where it might end. Another characteristic that is counter to the beliefs of many Western educators is the importance of the child's ability to negotiate in the peer group.

One of the most challenging aspects of the Reggio Emilia approach is the solicitation of multiple points of view regarding children's needs, interests, and abilities, and the concurrent faith in parents, teachers, and children to contribute in meaningful ways to the determination of school experiences. Teachers trust themselves to respond appropriately to children's ideas and interests, they trust children to be interested in things worth knowing about, and they trust parents to be informed and productive members of a cooperative educational team. The result is an atmosphere of community and collaboration that is developmentally appropriate for adults and children alike. &lt;ref name=New&gt;{{cite journal|last=New|first=Rebecca S.|title=Reggio Emelia: Some Lessons for U.S. Educators” ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education|journal=ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education|date=1993|url=https://www.ericdigests.org/1993/reggio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community support and parental involvement==
Reggio Emilia's tradition of community support for families with young children expands on a view, more strongly held in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, of children as the [[collective responsibility]] of the local community. In Reggio Emilia, the [[infant]]/[[toddler]] and [[pre-primary]] program is a vital part of the community, as reflected in the high level of financial support. Community involvement is also apparent in citizen membership in La Consulta, a school committee that exerts significant influence over [[local government]] policy.

[[Parents]] are a vital component to the Reggio Emilia philosophy; they are viewed as partners, collaborators, and advocates for their children. [[Teachers]] respect parents as each child's first teacher and involve parents in every aspect of the curriculum. It is not uncommon to see parents volunteering within Reggio Emilia classrooms throughout the school. This philosophy does not end when the child leaves the classroom. Some parents who choose to send their children to a Reggio Emilia program incorporate many of the [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] within their parenting and home life. The parents' role mirrors the community's, at both the school-wide and the classroom level. Parents are expected to take part in discussions about school policy, [[child development]] concerns, and [[curriculum]] planning and evaluation.

==The role of teachers==

[[File:Teachers and children in an italian kindergarten.jpg|left|thumb|Teachers and children in an Italian nursery school]]In the Reggio approach, the teacher is considered a co-learner and collaborator with the child and not just an instructor.  Teachers are encouraged to facilitate the child's learning by planning activities and lessons based on the child's interests, asking questions to further understanding, and actively engaging in the activities alongside the child, instead of passively observing the child learning.  "As partner to the child, the teacher is inside the learning situation" (Hewett, 2001).

Some implementations of the Reggio Emilia approach self-consciously juxtapose their conception of the teacher as autonomous co-learner with other approaches. For example:

Teachers' long-term commitment to enhancing their understanding of children is at the crux of the Reggio Emilia approach. They compensate for the meagre pre-service training of Italian early childhood teachers{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} by providing extensive staff development opportunities, with goals determined by the teachers themselves. Teacher autonomy is evident in the absence of teacher manuals, curriculum guides, or achievement tests. The lack of externally imposed mandates is joined by the imperative that teachers become skilled observers of children in order to inform their curriculum planning and implementation.&lt;ref name="reggioemillaapproach.net"&gt;[http://www.reggioemiliaapproach.net/about.php], The Regio Emila Approach - The Pre-school Childs (sic) languages of learning&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on projects with the child, the teacher can also expand the child's learning by collecting data that can be reviewed at a later time. The teacher needs to maintain an active, mutual participation in the activity to help ensure that the child clearly understands what is being "taught". Teachers partner with colleagues, students, and parents in the learning process. They discuss their observations with them, as part of an ongoing dialogue and continuing evolution of their ideas and practices.  This allows them to be flexible in their plans, preparations, and teaching approaches.

Often, teachers listen to and observe children in the classroom and record their observations to help plan the curriculum and prepare the environment and teaching tools to support the student's interests.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, G.S. (2010). "[http://www.education.com/reference/article/reggio-emilia/ Reggio Emilia]". Education.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===
Using a variety of media, teachers give careful attention to the documentation and presentation of the thinking of the students.  Rather than following standardized assessments, the teacher inquires and listens closely to the children.  An example of documentation might be a book or panel with the student’s words, drawings, and photographs.  By making learning visible, the student's thinking and feeling can be studied while the documentation serves to helps with evaluation of the educators' work and refinement of the curriculum.  It provides parents information regarding their child’s learning experience while creating an archive for the class and school.&lt;ref name=Wien&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wien|first=C.A.|author2=Guyevskey, V. |author3=Berdoussis, N. |title=Learning to Document in Reggio-inspired Education|journal=Early Childhood Research and Practice|year=2011|volume=13|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of the environment==
[[File:Spazi comuni nella scuola per l'infanzia.jpg|right|thumb|599x599px|The "piazza": common space in a preschool]]Malaguzzi believed the physical environment to be of fundamental importance to the early childhood program; he referred to it as the "third teacher", alongside adults and other students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/yc/node/324 NAEYC, Young Children, VOL. 70 NO. 5, Mary Ann Biermeier, ''Inspired by Reggio Emilia: Emergent Curriculum in Relationship-Driven Learning Environments''].  Retrieved 2017-06-02&lt;/ref&gt; Static  One of the aims in the design of new spaces - and the redesign of existing ones - is integration of the classroom space with the surrounding environment: the rest of the school, and community the school is a part of. The importance of the environment lies in the belief that children can best create meaning and make sense of their world through environments which support "complex, varied, sustained, and changing relationships between people, the world of experience, ideas and the many ways of expressing ideas."&lt;ref name="Cadwell"&gt;{{cite web | author=Cadwell, L.| year=1997| title=Bringing Reggio Emilia home:An innovative approach to early childhood education. | work=Teachers College Press, New York| url=| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, the preschools generally incorporate natural light and indoor plants.  Classrooms open to a center [[piazza]], kitchens are open to view, and access to the outside and surrounding community is provided through courtyards, large windows, and exterior doors in each classroom. Entries capture the attention of both children and adults through the use of mirrors (on the walls, floors, and ceilings), photographs, and children's work accompanied by transcriptions of their discussions. These same features characterize classroom interiors, where displays of project work are interspersed with arrays of found objects and classroom materials. In each case, the environment informs and engages the viewer.

Other supportive elements of the environment include ample space for supplies, frequently rearranged to draw attention to their aesthetic features. In each classroom there are studio spaces in the form of a large, centrally located [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] and a smaller mini-atelier, and clearly designated spaces for large- and small-group activities. Throughout the school, there is an effort to create opportunities for children to interact. The single dress-up area is in the center piazza; classrooms are connected with telephones, passageways or windows; and lunchrooms and bathrooms are designed to encourage community.&lt;ref name="Aesthetic Codes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Tarr, Patricia| year=2001| title=
Aesthetic Codes in Early Childhood Classrooms: What Art Educators Can Learn from Reggio Emilia| work=Art Education, Vol. 54, No. 3| url=| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohorts or groups of students stay with one teacher for a three-year period, creating consistency in environment and relationships.

==Long-term projects as vehicles for learning==
The curriculum is characterized by many features advocated by contemporary research on young children, including real-life problem-solving among peers, with numerous opportunities for creative thinking and exploration. Teachers often work on projects with small groups of children, while the rest of the class engages in a wide variety of self-selected activities typical of preschool classrooms.

The projects that teachers and children engage in are different in a number of ways from those that characterize American teachers' conceptions of unit or [[thematic learning|thematic studies]]. The topic of investigation may derive directly from teacher observations of children's spontaneous play and exploration. Project topics are also selected on the basis of an academic curiosity or social concern on the part of teachers or parents, or serendipitous events that direct the attention of the children and teachers. Reggio teachers place a high value on their ability to improvise and respond to children's predisposition to enjoy the unexpected. Regardless of their origins, successful projects are those that generate a sufficient amount of interest and uncertainty to provoke children's creative thinking and problem-solving and are open to different avenues of exploration. Because curriculum decisions are based on developmental and sociocultural concerns, small groups of children of varying abilities and interests, including those with special needs, work together on projects.

Projects begin with teachers observing and questioning children about the topic of interest. Based on children's responses, teachers introduce materials, questions, and opportunities that provoke children to further explore the topic. While some of these teacher provocations are anticipated, projects often move in unanticipated directions as a result of problems children identify. Thus, curriculum planning and implementation revolve around open-ended and often long-term projects that are based on the reciprocal nature of teacher-directed and child-initiated activity. All of the topics of interest are given by the children.  Within the project approach, children are given opportunities to make connections between prior and new knowledge while engaging in authentic tasks...

==The hundred languages of children==
The term "hundred languages of children" refers to the many ways that children have of expressing themselves.  Reggio teachers provide children different avenues for thinking, revising, constructing, negotiating, developing and symbolically expressing their thoughts and feelings. The goal is for the adults and children to better understand one another.&lt;ref name=NAREA /&gt;

As children proceed in an investigation, generating and testing their hypotheses, they are encouraged to depict their understanding through one of many symbolic languages, including drawing, sculpture, dramatic play, and writing. They work together toward the resolution of problems that arise. Teachers facilitate and then observe debates regarding the extent to which a child's drawing or other form of representation lives up to the expressed intent. Revision of drawings (and ideas) is encouraged, and teachers allow children to repeat activities and modify each other's work in the collective aim of better understanding the topic. Teachers foster children's involvement in the processes of exploration and evaluation, acknowledging the importance of their evolving products as vehicles for exchange.&lt;ref name="HundredLanguages"&gt;{{cite web | author=Edwards, C.,Gandini L., &amp; Forman, G. (Eds.)| year=1998| title= The Hundred Languages of Children | work=Reggio Emilia, Italy: Reggio Emilia| url=| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">The '''[[Robert Byrd|Robert C. Byrd]] Honors Scholarship Program''' was a federally funded and state-administered [[Merit-based financial aid|merit-based]] scholarship program in the United States.

== Program History ==
It was designed to recognize exceptionally able high school seniors who showed promise of continued excellence in postsecondary education. The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Office of Postsecondary Education]] awarded funds to state education agencies, which awarded [[scholarships]] (also known as '''Byrd Honors Scholarships''') to eligible applicants. Students received scholarship funds which were to go towards [[college]] expenses.

=== Funding ===
The Byrd Honors Scholarships were established in 1985, providing $1,500 nonrenewable scholarships to eligible students. In 1993, the program was expanded to allow students who successfully completed their first year of college to reapply for stipends for the following three years. This brought the scholarship to its final value of $6,000 over four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html Byrd.senate.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031004216/http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html |date=2008-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To pay for the over 27,000 scholars supported by the program, appropriations for the program were nearly $40,000,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/gtepiduesbyrd.pdf Ed.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the scholarship was eliminated for the 2011-2012 school year. As a result, new awards are not being given for that year, and payments for returning students will not be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hesc.com/content.nsf/SFC/Robert_C_Byrd_Honors_Scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application Requirements ==
Each state set the criteria for awarding the Byrd Honors Scholarships in addition to federal requirements. In any case, all applicants were to be high school graduates who:
* had been accepted for enrollment at institutions of higher education(IHEs) in the United States;
* had demonstrated outstanding academic achievement;
* and who showed promise of continued academic excellence.

The '''sheepskin effect''' is the hypothesis that the awarding of an educational degree (which was traditionally accompanied by a certificate made of [[parchment]]) would yield a higher income than the same amount of studying without possession of a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;Belman, D. and Heywood, J.S., 1991. Sheepskin effects in the returns to education: An examination of women and minorities. ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', pp.720-724. [[JSTOR]]: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2109413 2109413] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hungerford, T. and Solon, G., (1987). Sheepskin effects in the returns to education. ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', pp.175-177. [[JSTOR]]: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1937919 1937919]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many applied economics papers investigating the [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]] effect of the possession of such a certificate.

Newer evidence suggests that the sheepskin effect exists but could be contingent on the type of degrees - Associate's or Bachelor's degrees - obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, D., &amp; Page, M. (1996). Degrees Matter: New Evidence on Sheepskin Effects in the Returns to Education. ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', 78(4), 733-740.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12247">The '''small schools movement''', also known as the '''Small Schools Initiative''', in the [[United States of America]] holds that many [[high school]]s are too large and should be reorganized into smaller, autonomous schools of no more than 400 students, and optimally under 200. Many private schools of under 200 share design features which draw upon the benefits of organizations of less than 200 people.  In the public school version of the Small Schools Movement, students may be given a choice of which small school they want to join. Each of the smaller schools would offer students a feeling of connectedness between students who share the same or similar interests with them. In many ways, the small schools in high schools would resemble the team system of many [[middle school]]s across the United States. Small schools allow students to have more individual attention from teachers than most average high schools.  Many small schools are created by reforming a failed large school into several small ones in the same building, as is the case with the former [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in the Bronx in New York City.

== Benefits ==
Supporters of small schools claim that "in small schools, student achievement increases... Student attendance improves, graduation rates rise, and college going rates increase. Students are more engaged in their studies and are more likely to participate in extracurricular activities." This is due to the fact that students are more likely to be known by all of the adults and children in the school and are much less likely to "fall through the cracks."

[[Deborah Meier]] has argued that a small school allows all of the teachers to sit around a single table and to create a culture of shared decision-making. This should be a central component of a school that intends to teach children to become powerful members of a democracy--they should see their teachers acting democratically. Face-to-face democracy is much more likely and practical in a small school.&lt;ref name="klonsky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Power-Their-Ideas-Lessons-America/dp/0807031135/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369321806&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+their+ideas |title=Deborah Meier: The Power of Their Ideas |publisher=Beacon Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Democratic-Education-Practice-Mission-Practitioner/dp/0807753807/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367896244&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=matthew+knoester |title=Democratic Education in Practice: Inside the Mission Hill School |publisher=Teachers College Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive gains for student achievement within small schools can be seen in Oakland California. According to a study by the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at [[Brown University]] "small schools in Oakland are outperforming the large schools from which they emerged. In particular, students are completing more rigorous coursework and dropping out at lower rates, compared to the large schools." &lt;ref&gt;Shah, Sema; Kavitha Mediratta and Sara McAlister, [http://www.annenberginstitute.org/pdf/Mott_Oakland_high.pdf Building a Districtwide Small Schools Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626205035/http://www.annenberginstitute.org/pdf/Mott_Oakland_high.pdf |date=2010-06-26 }}, Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University, April 2009, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The American Dream and the Public Schools'' by Jennifer L. Hochschild and Nathan Scovronick, smaller classes sizes contribute to students in "early grades, and consistently challenging academic courses have been demonstrated to help disadvantaged
children achieve, just as they enable middle-class children to achieve." &lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Jennifer L. and Nathan Scovronick. ''The American Dream and the Public School'', Oxford University Press, 2003. p.5 New York&lt;/ref&gt;

"Smaller, more intimate learning communities consistently deliver better results in academics and discipline when compared to their larger counterparts. Big schools offer few opportunities to participate."&lt;ref&gt;WashingtonPost, 8/15/02&lt;/ref&gt; "Students at large schools are more prone to be alienated from their peers or engage in risky behavior." &lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota research, Los Angeles Times, 4/12/02&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits of small schools are noted in a study conducted by [[UCLA]] stating that "at their best, small schools are seen as enhancing strong personal bonds, home and community involvement, improved instructional quality and accountability, and improved teacher working conditions and job satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Center for Mental Health in Schools. (2009). Learning Supports and Small Schools. Los Angeles, CA: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading small schools proponent and founder of the Small Schools Coalition&lt;ref name="ssc"&gt;http://www.smallschoolscoalition.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Grauer School]] Dr. Stuart Grauer notes, "Research shows overwhelmingly that small schools lead to greater student academic gains and personal adjustment. In fact, data justifying this has been available for decades; it's just that policy makers have largely ignored it, no doubt due to the costs of such programs (and, of course, the politics). Right now, armed guards, metal detectors, and expulsions fail to get to the heart of the problem. (To a serious extent, they can actually create repressive conditions which make the problem worse.) Consequently, many people are looking for another way, and small schools can't be ignored much longer." Why do we keep building gigantic schools when we have such promising data? Dr. Grauer attributes this not only to economics, but to prevailing myths about American education: "Our collective memory of high school includes nostalgia such as proms, football games, exciting social lives, romance, and first cars. No matter that such memories do not apply to most students. The average high school student does not attend sporting events; indeed the larger the school, the smaller the percentage of student participation in these activities. For most students, the social scene in large high schools is tough and unforgiving, with sharp distinctions made between the small group of social haves and the far larger masses of have-nots. And high school memories seldom include a significant academic component, let alone an intellectual one ( 2001). In other words, many high schools have activities that everyone speaks of with pride—sacred cows like the marching band, the lacrosse team, the boosters. These untouchable activities represent the school's image, and they can't be changed, even though they serve a very small percentage of students and rarely have any connection to the most basic thing of all: the focus on student learning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grauerschool.com/about/philosophy Grauer School]&lt;/ref&gt;

Small schools are gaining popularity in the United States not only with students, but with donors as well. According to the Neal Peirce Column of [[the Washington Post Writers Group]], "far and away the biggest catalyst is the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. It has poured over $1 billion in five years into promoting smaller schools in Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee and other cities. Just this month New York City announced it was coming on board the small schools movement. It will open 60 schools with 500 students or less -- 41 high schools, four traditional middle schools and 15 based on an innovative sixth- or seventh-through-12th grade model." &lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Neal. "COULD SMALLER SCHOOLS BE THE AMERICAN FUTURE?" The Washington Post Writers Group 21 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and the growing data on small schools have provided some evidence regarding their better academic quality in comparison to their larger counterparts.&lt;ref name="klonsky"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-klonsky-phd/deborah-meier-small-schools_b_859362.html |title=Mike Klonsky: An Interview With Deborah Meier on the Small-Schools Movement |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2011-05-11|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Justice-Challenge-Schools-Teaching/dp/0807739626/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369321089&amp;sr=1-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords=a+simple+justice+pedro+noguera+small+schools |title=A Simple Justice: The Challenge of Small Schools |publisher=Teachers College Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Sharif Shakrani, the co-director of the Education Policy Center at [[Michigan State University]], "Recent studies suggest students in small public high schools perform better academically, have higher attendance rates, feel safer, experience fewer behavior problems and participate more frequently in extracurricular activities." &lt;ref name="Shakrani"&gt;Shakrani, Sharif. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/3e/61/2c.pdf "A Big Idea: Smaller High Schools."]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Education Policy Center, Michigan State University (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakrani also states that "a number of empirical articles document that students in small public and private high schools have higher achievement levels than those in large schools. Studies found higher student gains in reading, mathematics, science and social studies at small high schools than at large schools. Moreover, small schools are more likely to have fewer incidents of violence and misbehavior and that, in turn, has been found to contribute to higher attendance and lower drop-out and truancy rates." &lt;ref name="Shakrani" /&gt;

Small schools tend to emerge, particularly in urban areas, where there is a need for education reform due to failing school systems. High quality small public schools act as a remedy to large public schools that are falling behind in their ability to graduate students, achieve higher test scores and provide students with individual attention. The small school movement has modeled its efforts after small private schools which provide a similar learning environment which is based upon providing for the needs of their students.

== Criticisms ==
Many criticisms stem from the fact that the term "small school" is not uniform.  For instance, schools of between 400 and 1200 students are often researched as small schools despite having few of the attributes of small schools (e.g., a community of 200 or less, class size of less than 15, and similar criteria often applied).&lt;ref name="ssc"/&gt;
Hence, they point out that large schools tend to have a wider diversity of course offerings, as well as more clubs, arts programs, higher performing sports teams, and other extracurricular activities such as school newspapers and social events. Small schools advocates point out that in schools of less than 400 and especially less than 230, students have more access to enrichment and leadership programs. Some schools have abandoned the small school approach after failures to overcome these difficulties, even after being offered grants to continue these experiments. Other districts have expanded this movement by shutting down large schools and opening more smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;Jehlen, Alain and Cynthia Kopkowski (February 2006) [http://www.nea.org/home/12214.htm "Is Smaller Better?"] ''NEA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gates Foundation, which supports and funds small schools, is beginning to change its focus to working directly on improving instruction, giving grants to improve math and science instruction, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Linda (November 5, 2006) [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003348701_gates05m.html "Foundation's small-schools experiment has yet to yield big results."] ''Seattle Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8792">'''Student–teacher ratio''' or '''student–faculty ratio''' is the number of students who attend a [[school]] or [[university]] divided by the number of teachers in the institution. For example, a student–teacher ratio of 10:1 indicates that there are 10 students for every one teacher. The term can also be reversed to create a teacher–student ratio.

The ratio is often used as a proxy for [[class size]], although various factors can lead to class size varying independently of student–teacher ratio (and vice versa).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBZCxM1-Pg8C&amp;pg=PA46|pages=45–46|title=Does Measurement Measure Up?: How Numbers Reveal and Conceal the Truth|first=John M.|last=Henshaw|isbn=9780801883750|year=2006|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, the student–teacher ratio will be significantly lower than the average class size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZXSTgRueeMC&amp;pg=PA37|page=37|title=Multilevel Modeling of Social Problems: A Causal Perspective|first=Robert B |last=Smith|isbn=9789048198559|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student–teacher ratios vary widely among developed countries.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}} In [[primary education]], the average student–teacher ratio among members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] is just below 16, but ranges from 40 in Brazil to 28 in Mexico to 11 in Hungary and Luxembourg.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}}

==Relationship to class size==

Factors that can affect the relationship between student–teacher ratio and class size include the number of teachers with non-teaching duties, the number of classes per teacher, and the number of teachers per class. In addition, if there are small classes for a small number of students, for example for [[special education]] or [[second language]] learners, the student–teacher ratio for the institution will be misleadingly low relative to the average student's experience.{{sfn|Henshaw|2006|p=46}}

An example of this variation is that both Israel and the United States have an average student–faculty ratio of 15, but the average class size is 21 in the United States but 27 in Israel.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}}

== Background ==

A low student–teacher ratio is often used as a [[marketing|selling point]] to those choosing schools for [[tertiary education]]. On the other hand, high student–teacher ratio is often cited for criticizing proportionately underfunded schools or school systems, or as evidence of the need for legislative change or more funding for education.

In the [[United States]], some states have enacted [[legislation]] mandating a maximum student–teacher ratio for specific grade levels, particularly [[kindergarten]]. When such figures are stated for schools, they often represent averages ([[mean]]s) and thus are vulnerable to [[Skewness|skewing]]. For example, figures may be biased as follows: if one classroom has a 30:1 ratio and another has a 10:1 ratio, the school could thus claim to have a 20:1 ratio overall. In schools, such ratios are indicative of possible staff changes. If the student–teacher ratio is 50:1, the school will probably consider hiring a few teachers. If the ratio is very low, classes could be combined and teachers fired. In extreme cases, the school may close, due to its apparent redundancy.

Classes with too many students are often disrupting to education. Also, too many students in a class results in a diverse field of students, with varying degrees of learning ability. Consequently, the class will spend time for less academic students to assimilate the information, when that time could be better spent progressing through the [[curriculum]]. In this way, student–teacher ratios are compelling arguments for advanced or honors classes.

== Arguments ==

Numerous sources argue that lower student–teacher ratios are better at teaching students complex subjects, such as physics, mathematics and chemistry, than those with a higher ratio of students to teachers. Commonly, the schools with lower student–teacher ratios are more exclusive, have a higher attendance of whites and are in non-inner urban areas and/or fee-paying (non-government) institutions.&lt;ref name="Brookings"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Card |authorlink=David Card |author2=Alan B. Krueger |author2-link=Alan B. Krueger  |chapter=School Quality and the Return to Education |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3UIwF9P1WUC&amp;pg=PA118 |editor=Gary Burtless |editor-link=Gary Burtless |title=Does money matter?: the effect of school resources on student achievement and adult success |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |year=1996 |pages=118–119 |isbn=0-8157-1274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifold arguments and controversies of funding and student–teacher ratios have been the basis for a multitude of studies and debates. One view is illustrated below:
{{quotation|Many analysts have found that extra school resources play a negligible role in improving student achievement while children are in school. Yet many economists have gathered data showing that students who attend well-endowed schools grow up to enjoy better job market success than children whose education takes place in schools where resources are limited. For example, children who attend schools with a lower pupil–teacher ratio and a better educated teaching staff appear to earn higher wages as adults than children who attend poorer schools.&lt;ref name="Brookings" /&gt;}}

Smaller classes are widely believed to benefit all pupils because of individual attention from teachers, and low-attaining pupils are seen to benefit more at the [[secondary school]] level, where the content level is more challenging. Pupils in large classes drift off task because of too much instruction from the teacher to the whole class instead of individual attention, and low-attaining students are most affected.&lt;ref name="Blachford 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Peter | last = Blatchford | first2 = Paul | last2 = Bassett | first3 = Penelope | last3 = Brown | year = 2011 | title = Examining the effect of class size on classroom engagement and teacher—pupil interaction: Differences in relation to pupil prior attainment and primary vs. secondary schools | journal = Learning and Instruction | volume = 21 | pages = 715–30 | doi = 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2011.04.001 | url = http://www.classsizematters.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Examining-the-effect-of-class-size-on-classroom-engagement-and-Teacher-pupil-interaction-Differences-in-relation-to-pupil-prior-attainment-and-primary-vs.-secondary-schools.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students benefit in later grades from being in small classes during early grades. Longer periods in small classes resulted in more increases in achievement in later grades for all students. In reading and science, low achievers benefit more from being in small classes. The benefits of small class sizes reduce the student achievement gap in reading and science in later grades.&lt;ref name="Konstantopoulos 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Konstantopoulos | first = Spyros | last2 = Chung | first2 = Vicki | year = 2009 | title = What Are the Long-Term Effects of Small Classes on the Achievement Gap?

The '''Territory-wide System Assessment''' ([[Abbreviation]]: TSA; {{zh|全港性系統評估}}) is an assessment introduced by the [[Education Commission]] in the report of [http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/about-edb/policy/edu-reform/ "Reform Proposal for the Education System in Hong Kong"] in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority|url = http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/sa_tsa/tsa/|website = www.hkeaa.edu.hk|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is held in June every [[year]] since 2004 for students of Primary 3, Primary 6 (implemented in alternate year starting from 2011) and Secondary 3. The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is designed for facilitating learning and teaching after evaluating the [[average]] learning standard of the students in the subject of [[Chinese language]], [[English language]] and [[Mathematics]] at the end of key stage 1-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url = http://www.bca.hkeaa.edu.hk/web/TSA/en/Faq.html#Q01|website = http://www.bca.hkeaa.edu.hk/web/TSA/en/Faq.html#Q01|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' (TSA) is a territory-level assessment launched and administered by the [[Education Bureau]] (Chinese:[[cmn:教育局 (香港)|教育局]]) since 2004. The aims of the ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is to objectively assess the basic learning competencies and learning progress of the students at different stages of learning. The capabilities of students are analysed through the ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' in order to improve the [[effectiveness]] in learning and teaching. Educational policies can be reviewed with the help of the [[data]] collected through the ''Territory-wide System Assessment''.

The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is conducted in the form of pencil and paper (except Chinese and English [[oral exam|oral]] assessment) and the examined [[Course (education)|subjects]] are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] Language, [[English language|English]] Language and [[Mathematics]].  The ''Territory-wide System Assessment'' is compulsory for all Primary 3, Primary 6 and Secondary 3 students from government-subsidised schools. The assessment results of the students with intellectual disabilities, e.g. suffering from [[dyslexia]] or [[Eddie Ng|mental retardation]] can be excluded after getting medical approval.

[[File:49ers training camp 2010-08-09 28.JPG|thumb|The [[San Francisco 49ers]] conducting training camp at the team's headquarters and practice facility in [[Santa Clara, California]] in August 2010]]
In the [[National Football League]], '''training camp''' refers to the time before the season commences. During this time, teams will sometimes congregate at an outside location, usually a university, to conduct [[training camp]] for at least the first few weeks. This is similar to [[baseball]]'s [[spring training]].

Training camp is used in several different ways. New players and coaches use it to acclimate themselves to new teammates and systems. For younger players, it serves as a period of evaluation; for veterans, it is time to round back into form.

Training camp is divided into several different components. The first is scrimmages. These are pseudo-games where teams run nearly full games' worth of plays. Sometimes, two practice sessions are held on the same day. This concept is referred to as ''two-a-days''. Other parts of training camp include drills, meetings with coaches and other players at one's position, [[weight training]], and pre-season games.

The latter half of training camp leads directly into the [[National Football League exhibition season|exhibition season]].

With NFL training camps starting in late-July, the biggest concern has been dehydration. In 2001, [[Minnesota Vikings]] player [[Korey Stringer]] died of a medical condition based from [[dehydration]] and [[heatstroke]]. The death of Stringer prompted the NFL to change their training policies. At each practice, every team must have the team doctor and trainers on the field; additionally, an ambulance must be present during practices.

With NFL training camps beginning in late July, severe weather can affect practice and exhibition games. In 2002, a Cleveland Browns exhibition game ended due to lightning near [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]], and severe storms have been known to disrupt training camps.

Fans are often able to visit their favorite team's training camp to catch an early look at the players; admission to practices is often free or substantially less expensive than a game ticket, making training camp trips a popular option for fans who cannot attend many games due to financial or other reasons. NFL teams often sell souvenirs and concessions at camp sites along with offering activities and events to make training camp a more fan-friendly experience.

Official NFL training camps should be distinguished from private training camps, often for certain tactics or positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steveclarksondreammaker.com/quarterback-camp Quarterback Camp]. [[Steve Clarkson]] Dreammaker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized team activities==
Recently the NFL has let teams have off-season training sessions, officially called "organized team activities" (OTAs). Many teams use the OTAs to help develop players and make them better. These training sessions are in late May and early June. The OTAs are the only practices between the end of the previous season and the start of training camp. Players new to the NFL attend seminars and lectures organized by the NFL from mid-June to mid-July. For veteran players, they use the off-time to sponsor football camps for children, [[golf]] outings for charity, or even some family time.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Differences with baseball==
Unlike [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]], where teams congregate at locations in two states (Arizona and Florida), NFL teams train all over the [[United States]]. However, an increasing number of teams do so in the same facilities at which they practice all year long - 19 teams in 2014, and 20 in 2015, up from five in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/more-nfl-teams-opting-for-comforts-of-home-over-going-away-for-training-camp-new-york-giants-philadelphia-eagles-072613|title=More teams staying home for camp|author=|date=26 July 2013|website=foxsports.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most teams have abandoned remote locations to "come home" for training camp, largely for practicality reasons. Many clubs have recently constructed state-of-the-art practice facilities, replete with amenities (multiple practice fields, indoor practice fields, weightlifting rooms, meeting rooms, lecture halls, film study rooms, cafeteria, medical facilities, IT infrastructure, etc.) that can not be provided or matched at other distant locations (colleges, parks, etc.) Most if not all of these new team practice facilities were in fact designed with hosting training camp in mind, and they are able to accommodate the expanded training camp roster sizes. In addition, the cost of temporarily relocating and accommodating the entire team organization to another location is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2527998-why-are-nfl-teams-no-longer-traveling-for-training-camp|title=Why Are NFL Teams No Longer Traveling for Training Camp?|first=Brad|last=Gagnon|date=|website=bleacherreport.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitudes about how to run training camp have also evolved - leading more teams to stay home. With ''Organized Team Activities'' ("OTAs"), mini-camps, and conditioning during the off-season, players remain in top physical shape year-round. The focus of training camp is no longer getting players back in shape, but more of fostering camaraderie.

For example, the Lions' camp was long held at [[Saginaw Valley State College]], the Broncos trained at the [[University of Northern Colorado]], the Patriots at [[Bryant University]] in [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]], and the Redskins moved in from [[Dickinson College]], the former site of [[Carlisle Indian School]]. Tampa Bay used to train at the [[University of Tampa]], then at the [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex]] before moving permanently back to their headquarters. Similarly, after many years on the road, the [[New York Jets|Jets]] ([[State University of New York at Cortland|SUNY Cortland]]) and the [[New York Giants|Giants]] ([[Albany, New York|Albany]]) both recently moved back to team headquarters.

There are still a handful of teams that use somewhat distant locations at the fringes of their markets to promote their team. For instance, the [[Buffalo Bills]] moved their training camp from [[State University of New York at Fredonia|SUNY Fredonia]] to [[Saint John Fisher College]] in suburban [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]; as a team representing one of the smallest cities in the NFL, the holding of training camp in the nearby city of Rochester allows the Bills to lay claim to a larger portion of [[upstate New York]] and thus take advantage of a market closer in size to other teams in the NFL (similar rationale was used for the [[Bills Toronto Series|Bills' games in Toronto, Ontario, Canada]] prior to 2014). The Dallas Cowboys have historically hosted their training camp in locales very distant from their home market, even before they were given the moniker "[[America's Team]]" in the late 1970s; from 2001 to 2015, the Cowboys held their training camp at the River Ridge Playing Fields in [[Oxnard, California]], a suburb of Los Angeles. The Cowboys' arrangement with Oxnard ended when the [[Los Angeles Rams]] returned to southern California and the Cowboys constructed a [[The Ford Center at The Star|considerable multi-purpose facility]] in [[Frisco, Texas]] whose main lure is being the team's practice facility.

Another difference between spring training and training camp is that true intra-squad games do not take place (anymore), though informal scrimmages are very common. Split-squad games never happen in the NFL. It is also fairly common to see two teams hold a short joint camp and scrimmage at a neutral site in addition to their main camp.

The '''University of Applied Sciences''' (UAS), as is generally known '''Vocational University''', or called Professional University, Applied Technological University, College of Higher Vocational Studies, is an institution of [[higher education]] and sometimes [[research]], which provides both [[tertiary education|tertiary]] and sometimes [[quaternary education]] and grants [[academic degree]]s at all levels ([[bachelor degree|bachelor]], [[master degree|master]], and sometimes [[doctorate degree|doctorate]]) in a variety of subjects.

In some countries, a vocational university more precisely grants [[professional degree]]s like professional bachelor's degree, Professional master's degree and Professional doctorates. The term is not officially used in many countries and an assignment to a certain type of university in a certain country's educational system is therefore difficult.  The UK once had a very extensive vocational university sector with its polytechnic system dating back to the mid 19th century.  Vocational universities are often regulated and funded differently (for example, by the local government rather than the state) from research-focused universities, and the degrees granted are not necessarily interchangeable.

==Education==
The education at vocational universities combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. It can be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which may concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge. There is also the historical background that an educational institution was called a [[medieval university|university]] in the [[Middle Ages]] only if a certain classical [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] of subjects was taught (typically including [[philosophy]], [[medicine]] and [[theology]]). In modern times, other subjects, namely [[natural science|natural]] and [[engineering]] sciences, became more important, but institutions of [[tertiary education]] focusing on these subjects and not offering the classical canon have until recently or are still denied the prestigious denomination "university" in all countries. They had to use other, more general terms (which in many languages are [[false friend]]s of the English term "high school", sometimes with modifiers), including ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' in [[German language|German]], ''Haute École'' in [[French language|French]] ([[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]]), ''Hogeschool'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Høyskole'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], ''Scuola universitaria professionale'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], etc.

There are different varieties, including vocational universities of applied sciences (also named [[institute of technology|polytechnic]]s or institutes of technology), vocational universities of liberal arts, etc. In recent years, many vocational universities have received full university status, such as the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna]], [[Austria]] (Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien, formerly Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Wien), or the [[Örebro University]], [[Sweden]] (formerly Örebro Högskola). There are also some establishments which now have full university status but continue to use their former names, such as the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

==Vocational universities in Europe==

===Austria ===
{{Main|Fachhochschule}}
===Finland===
*[[Ammattikorkeakoulu]] (Yrkeshögskola in Swedish, translated ''University of Applied Sciences'', literally "vocational high school"). Do not grant [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] or [[doctorate]] degrees.

Notice: certain universities are called ''korkeakoulu'' because they effectively have only one faculty, e.g. ''Teatterikorkeakoulu'', the Theatre Academy, whereas universities with several faculties are called ''yliopisto''. The term ''ammattikorkeakoulu'' (AMK) creates some confusion with ''korkeakoulu'', because traditionally AMK's were not considered universities. A graduate of university of applied sciences (''ammattikorkeakoulu'') is generally not eligible for doctoral studies in Finnish universities without formally completing a master's degree from a university (''yliopisto'').

===Germany===
{{Main|Fachhochschule}}
The term vocational university is not used. In contrast to traditional German universities, a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (translated ''University of Applied Sciences'') has a more practical profile. Universities of Applied Sciences grant [[Bachelor degree]]s and [[Master degree]]s. Some Universities of Applied Sciences run doctoral programs where the degree itself is awarded by a partner institution. Furthermore, ''Berufsakademie'' is a college type strongly inspired by the [[dual education system]]. A ''Berufsakademie'' is called a ''university of cooperative education'' in English and only grants bachelor's degrees. This type of institution was first created in the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and now exists in [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Saarland]], [[Saxony]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], and [[Thuringia]], but not in the other German states. In 2009, Baden-Württemberg transformed its Berufsakademie into a new type of institution, which until now only exists in that state, a "Duale Hochschule". In English, this type of institution is also called ''university of cooperative education'', but a Duale Hochschule also offers master's degrees.

===Greece===
{{main|List of universities in Greece#Technological educational institutes / Universities of Applied Sciences}}
In Greece, comparable institutions to the Vocational Universities (or perhaps better to the Universities of Applied Sciences) are the Technological Educational Institutes (TEIs). These constitute part and parcel of the  Higher Education in Greece and offer in their own capacity bachelor's and master's degrees, and soon Doctorate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esos.gr/arthra/49939/didaktorika-apo-tei-i-epistoli-toy-yp-paideias-pros-toys-proedroys-ton-tei|title=Διδακτορικά από ΤΕΙ- Η επιστολή του υπ. Παιδείας προς τους προέδρους των ΤΕΙ|author=|date=9 April 2017|website=esos.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

On the other hand, the term [[College]] in Greece may refer, among others, to the institutions that are officially titled Centres of Post-lyceum(secondary) Education. These have a solely professional, i.e. non-academic, orientation according to existing Greek law, and are so far only private. However, they run in collaboration with foreign authorities, such as universities and accreditation organisations, that may recognise them academically. They may offer [[professional]] bachelor degrees of minimum three years, as well as master and doctorate degrees.

===Netherlands===
{{main|List of universities in the Netherlands}}
As of January 29, 2008, a Dutch ''hogeschool'' '''(HBO)''' may call itself a "University of Applied Sciences" in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffic.nl/nederlandse-organisaties/nieuws-evenementen/nieuws-archief/nieuws-archief-2008/februari/engelstalige-naam-voor-nederlandse-hogescholen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815002132/http://www.nuffic.nl/nederlandse-organisaties/nieuws-evenementen/nieuws-archief/nieuws-archief-2008/februari/engelstalige-naam-voor-nederlandse-hogescholen |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities of Applied Sciences offer [[bachelor's degrees]] and [[master's degrees]], but no doctorates.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2013-35337.html|title=Regeling van de Minister van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap van 11 december 2013, nr. 528477, houdende een wijziging van de Regeling andere toevoeging aan wo-graden in verband met het vaststellen van de referentielijst internationale herkenbaarheid titulatuur hoger beroepsonderwijs en het vaststellen van graden met toevoegingen|first=Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en|last=Wetenschap|date=|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 January 2014 there is no longer a distinction between the bachelor's and master's degrees awarded by the Dutch research universities (Dutch "universiteiten") and the Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences (Dutch "hogescholen"), therefore graduates from Universities of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands will obtain a Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), Master of Science (MSc) or an equivalent academic title corresponding to their specific field of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-titel-mag-ik-voeren-als-ik-ben-afgestudeerd-of-gepromoveerd.html|title=Welke titel mag ik voeren als ik ben afgestudeerd of gepromoveerd aan universiteit of hogeschool?|first=Ministerie van Algemene|last=Zaken|date=|website=www.rijksoverheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

''Hogescholen'' in the Netherlands have been provided with the right to conduct research by the revised Higher Education and Research Act (WHOO)2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.innovationinbusiness.research.hu.nl/Onderzoek.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406145037/http://www.innovationinbusiness.research.hu.nl/Onderzoek.aspx |archive-date=2013-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The main difference between universities (universitet) and vocational universities (högskola, official translation ''university college'') is that only the former ones have the right to award doctorate degrees in all subjects they offer. Some vocational universities have been given such rights within limited areas of research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">'''Willy Moog''' (also: Wilhelm or Willi Moog; born 22 January 1888 in [[Sinntal|Neuengronau]] (community of Sinntal) – 24 October 1935 in [[Braunschweig]]) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[educator]].

== Life ==

Willy Moog studied from 1906 to 1909 in [[Berlin]], [[Munich]] and [[Gießen]]; his areas of primary focus were Germanic Studies and Philosophy. He was inspired by the Berlin lectures of [[Georg Simmel]] and studied Neo-Kantianism with the school around [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. 1915-1918 he served, against his will, as soldier in [[World War I]], at a customs office at the Prussian-Polish-Russian border.  In 1919, Moog married Mathilde Buss (1884-1958), an artist painter and lyric.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry "Moog, Willy" in ''Stadtlexikon Darmstadt'', Darmstadt 2006 (in German; Dictionary on the history of the city Darmstadt in Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had one daughter, Marianne Moog-Hoff (1921-1999), who during [[World War II]] emigrated to [[Oslo]] in Norway and married a Norwegian.

In the early 1930s, Moog faced severe problems with the [[Nazi]] government, who ruled the federal state of Braunschweig, impersonated by president [[Dietrich Klagges]], before [[Adolf Hitler]] came into power.  Moog committed suicide in fall 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicole C. Karafyllis]]: ''Willy Moog (1888-1935): Ein Philosophenleben''. Freiburg: Karl Alber (2015, in German), chapter III.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1909 he wrote a dissertation on the psychology of literature under the supervision of [[Karl Groos]] at the [[Universität Gießen]], entitled "Natur und Ich in Goethes Lyrik" (''Nature and I in Goethe's lyrics'').  During the First World War, Moog published his first book ''Kant's views on Peace and War'' (1917). Moog was a fervent [[pacifist]]. In 1919, he accomplished his [[habilitation]] at [[Universität Greifswald]] with the book on ''Logik, Psychologie und Psychologismus'', a then well-known classic on the interdisciplinary debates on [[psychologism]]. In Greifswald, he also learned about the philosophy of [[William James]] through one of his peers, [[Johannes Rehmke]].

In 1924 Moog became Full Professor of Philosophy, Pedagigcs and Psychology at [[Braunschweig University of Technology]].  From 1927-1930 he was Dean of the Faculty of Cultural Studies. In 1930, his renowned book ''Hegel und die Hegelsche Schule'' was published and received international attention.  It was translated into Spanish by [[José Gaos]] in 1931. Moog extensively contributed to the [[history of philosophy]], on which he wrote two textbooks, allied by a two volume set on the ''History of [[Pedagogics]]'' (Vol. I, 1927; Vol. II 1933, 9th ed. 1991). With the help of [[Max Frischeisen-Köhler]], the co-edited Volume III of [[Friedrich Ueberweg]] ''Grundriß der Geschichte der Philosophie'' (on early modern philosophy) appeared in 1924. Moog was well connected to the philosophers of his time, among them [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Arthur Liebert]], [[Helmuth Plessner]], [[Heinrich Scholz]] and [[Max Wentscher]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis: ''Willy Moog (1888-1935): Ein Philosophenleben''. Freiburg: Karl Alber (2015, in German), chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A long-term research project on Moog is located at the philosophy department of [[Technische Universität Braunschweig|Technischen Universität Braunschweig]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/philosophie/historie |title=Zur Historie des Seminars |author=Nicole Karafyllis |publisher=[[Technische Universität Braunschweig]] |date=2011-12-15 |access-date=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first biography on Moog, written by philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], has been published in January 2015 at the German Karl Alber Verlag in [[Freiburg]]. During her biographical research, she found out that Willy Moog's relatives are directly related to the US-American pioneer of synthesizer [[Robert Moog]] (whose grandfather came from the region around [[Marburg]] in Germany).

{{UDP|date=January 2018}}'''The Yidan Prize''' (/ji: ‘dan/） is an educational prize founded in 2016 by [[Chen Yidan|Dr. Charles Chen]]. The prize is awarded each year to two individuals or organizations whose work has made profound contributions to education [[research]] and development. The prize comprises two categories: the Yidan Prize for Education Research, which recognizes outstanding research that makes significant contributions to education, and the Yidan Prize for Education Development, which recognizes innovative ideas that tackle pressing challenges in the field of education.

The prize is financed and governed by a HK$2.5 billion (about US$320 million) independent trust. Each prize carries an award of HK$30 million (about US$3.87 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38639891|title=Chinese billionaire offers biggest education prize - BBC|website=www.bbc.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; – half cash award and half project fund – as well as a gold medal. Through a series of initiatives, the prize serves to provide a platform that allows the global community to engage in conversation around education and to play a role in education philanthropy.

Nominees can be either individuals or teams of up to three representatives, who can be teachers, researchers, academics, policy makers and advocates among others. The two independent judging panels will screen valid nominations and select a candidate for each prize category. Candidates are assessed on four criteria: [[future orientation]], [[innovation]], transformation and [[sustainability]].

The Yidan Prize unveiled its inaugural laureates on 19 September 2017 in [[Hong Kong]]. They are [[Carol Dweck|Carol S. Dweck]] of Stanford University and [[Vicky Colbert]],&lt;ref&gt;https://ie-today.co.uk/Article/carol-dweck-and-vicky-colbert-win-largest-education-prize&lt;/ref&gt; founder and director of Fundación Escuela Nueva. At the inaugural Yidan Prize Award Presentation Ceremony and the Yidan Prize Summit, they shared their ground-breaking work in education.

On September 19, 2017, the Yidan Prize Foundation launched the first Worldwide Educating for the Future Index. The index was commissioned by the Yidan Prize Foundation and conducted by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. It evaluates how 35 developed and developing economies, representing 88% of global GDP and 77% of global population, are preparing the next generation with the skills needed for the future. The index is based on 16 indicators across three thematic categories: education policy, teaching environment and socio-economic environment. It's the world’s first ever comprehensive benchmarking tool that focuses on inputs to education systems, as opposed to outputs such as test scores. The index examines the strengths and weaknesses of education systems for the next generation and creates a blueprint for governments to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/edtechresearcher/2017/10/a_blueprint_for_the_future_of_education_-_the_worldwide_educating_for_the_future_index.html|title=The Worldwide Educating for the Future Index - A Blueprint for Change|website=www.edweek.org|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
