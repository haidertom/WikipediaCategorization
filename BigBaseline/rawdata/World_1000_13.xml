The '''Brussels effect''' is the process of unilateral regulatory globalisation caused by the [[European Union]] [[de facto]] (but not necessarily [[de_jure|de jure]]) externalising its laws outside its borders through market mechanisms.

== Cause ==
The combination of market size, market importance&lt;ref name=Bradford2012&gt;Bradford, Anu (2012) ''The Brussels Effect.'' Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 107, No. 1, 2012; Columbia Law and Economics Working Paper No. 533. SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2770634 &lt;/ref&gt;, relatively stringent standards and regulatory capacity&lt;ref&gt;Bach, David and Newman, Abraham (2007) – ''The European regulatory state and global public policy: micro-institutions, macro-influence'' – Journal of European Public Policy https://doi.org/10.1080/13501760701497659&lt;/ref&gt; of the European Union can have the effect that firms trading internationally find that it is not economically, legally or technically practical to maintain lower standards in non-EU markets. Non-EU companies exporting globally can find that it is beneficial to adopt standards set in Brussels uniformly throughout their business.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe.'' Columbia Law School http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2013/january2013/brussels-effect&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal – ''Hot U.S. Import: European Regulations'' May 2018 https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-pickup-of-new-data-privacy-rules-reflects-eus-growing-influence-1525685400&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The term Brussels effect was coined in 2012 by Professor Anu Bradford of Columbia Law School&lt;ref name=Bradford2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecture, March 2012 - "''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe''" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeFmR3Fkjzw&lt;/ref&gt; and named after the similar [[California effect]] that can be seen within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=David|title=Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental regulation in a global economy|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674900837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race to the top and race to the bottom ==
The [[California effect]] and the Brussels effect are a form of ‘race to the top’ where the most stringent standard has an appeal to companies operating across multiple regulatory environments as it makes global production and exports easier.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the ‘Brussels effect’ will undermine Brexit regulatory push'' July 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/fd5ca278-6654-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the whole world feels the ‘Brussels effect’'' November 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/7059dbf8-a82a-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Insights – ''Three Questions: Prof. David Bach on the Reach of European Privacy Regulations'' https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/three-questions-prof-david-bach-on-the-reach-of-european-privacy-regulations&lt;/ref&gt; The effects are the opposite of the ''Delaware effect'', a [[race to the bottom]] where jurisdictions can purposely choose to lower its regulatory requirements in an attempt to attract businesses looking for the least stringent standard. &lt;ref name="Bloomberg NJ Del."&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robert E. Wright|title=How Delaware Became the King of U.S. Corporate Charters|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-06-08/how-delaware-became-the-king-of-u-s-corporate-charters|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=''Bloomberg View''|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Anti-trust===
The October 2000 $42 billion proposed acquisition of US-based Honeywell International by US-based General Electric was blocked by the EU antitrust authorities on the grounds of risking a horizontal monopoly in jet engines. The merger could not proceed because, despite the American Department of Justice having already approved the merger between these two US based entities, it was not legally possible to let the acquisition proceed in one important market, but not in another. &lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Case No COMP/M.2220 - General Electric/Honeywell http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=2_M_2220&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
US-based multinational [[Dow Chemical]] announced in 2006 it would comply with the EU's [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) regulation for the production and use of chemical substances across its global operation.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dow and REACH - Protecting human health and the environment https://reach.dow.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reach External FAQs https://consumer.dow.com/en-us/technical-support/ehs-portal/reach-external-faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airplane emissions===
In 2012 the EU included aviation into its existing [[European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]]. This means that any airline, regardless of their country of origin, has to purchase emissions permits for any flights within the [[European_Economic_Area|European Economic Area]]. &lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Reducing emissions from aviation https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of complying with EU aviation emission regulation puts pressure on manufacturers to design airplanes with improved efficiency and reduced emissions. As major airlines would not likely purchase airplanes specifically to fly outside the EEA, the EU’s stricter aviation standards have an impact on global airplane fleets, regardless of the jurisdiction of the airline.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;

===Data protection and privacy===
With the introduction of the[[Data_Protection_Directive | Data Protection Directive]] in 1995 the EU had opted for a strict top-down approach to data privacy. &lt;ref&gt;Gady, Franz-Stefan (2014) EU/U.S. Approaches to Data Privacy and the "Brussels Effect": A Comparative Analysis https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773645&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor, the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), was adopted on 14 April 2016 and had a global effect &lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Information wars: How Europe became the world’s data police'' May 2018 https://www.ft.com/content/1aa9b0fa-5786-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development – ''Europe’s Data Privacy Rules Set New Global Approach to Consumer Rights'' May 2018 https://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/europe%e2%80%99s-data-privacy-rules-set-new-global-approach-to-consumer-rights&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, during negotiations for a new Japan-EU trade deal, Japan set up an independent agency to handle privacy complaints to conform with the EU's new privacy regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Politico.EU – ''Europe’s new data protection rules export privacy standards worldwide'' January 2018 https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-data-protection-privacy-standards-gdpr-general-protection-data-regulation/&lt;/ref&gt;
Facebook announced in April 2018 that it would implement parts of the GDPR globally&lt;ref&gt;Facebook's commitment to data protection and privacy in compliance with the GDPR https://www.facebook.com/business/news/facebooks-commitment-to-data-protection-and-privacy-in-compliance-with-the-gdpr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complying With New Privacy Laws and Offering New Privacy Protections to Everyone, No Matter Where You Live https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections/&lt;/ref&gt;, Sonos announced in April 2018 that it would implement the GDPR globally&lt;ref&gt;We’re Updating the Sonos Privacy Statement https://blog.sonos.com/en-gb/updating-sonos-privacy-statement/&lt;/ref&gt; and Microsoft announced in May 2018 that it would implement GDPR compliance for all its customers globally.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft’s commitment to GDPR, privacy and putting customers in control of their own data https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/05/21/microsofts-commitment-to-gdpr-privacy-and-putting-customers-in-control-of-their-own-data/&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort lasted from 1982 to the 1990s, and generally coincides with [[James P. Grant]]'s tenure as executive director of UNICEF (1980–1995). The child survival revolution included various programs and conferences, including the [[World Summit for Children]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=gautam/&gt;

Rather than treating child mortality as a measurement of development, the effort sought to directly reduce child mortality as a way toward development.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1980s.htm |title=The 1980s: Campaign for child survival |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations, including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[UNDP]], the [[World Bank]], and [[WHO]] joined; thus the revolution is sometimes called "a grand alliance for children".&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; The revolution was analogized with the [[Green Revolution]] by James Grant.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|42}}

|}

==Results and reception==
The initial reaction to Grant's announcement of the child survival revolution was overwhelmingly negative due to several reasons, including practical reasons, e.g., the money and infrastructure to support Grant's plans not existing.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|24}}

It is estimated that the child vaccination increased worldwide from 20% in 1982(?) to 80% in 1990 because of the child survival revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Black, Children First: The Story of UNICEF, Past and Present (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 33; see also UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1986 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1990, [[Donald Henderson|D. A. Henderson]] noted that although "dramatic progress" had been made because of the child survival revolution, the results were still "little-appreciated".&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

The child survival revolution is estimated to have saved the lives of 25 million children.&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|59}}

==Focus areas==
The genesis of the Child Survival Revolution can be traced to 1973 when [[James P. Grant]], gave his annual lecture at Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health. In reviewing research findings of Prof [[Carl E. Taylor]] Grant grasped how the collective package from Taylor's Narangwal research (childhood pneumonia, oral rehydration therapy, neonatal tetanus, family planning) served as a parallel to The Green Revolution, saying "we can now start to talk about a Child Survival Revolution!" &lt;ref&gt; Daniel C. Taylor and Carl E. Taylor (2016), Just and Lasting Change: When Communities Own Their Futures 2nd Edition (New York: Johns Hopkins University Press, p176-177)&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant had earlier been Deputy Director of USAID, and in that role had been an early and strong backer of [[The Green Revolution]], a global effort that dramatically raised global food supply through a package of agricultural innovations (new seed types, fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides, and mechanization). Grant grasped that it was the synergy that came through a package of interventions that would allow children to survive,

For much of the child survival revolution, James Grant and UNICEF adopted a strategy known as [[GOBI-FFF]], a form of selective primary healthcare:&lt;ref&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=G for growth monitoring to detect undernutrition in small children, O for [[oral rehydration therapy]] [ORT] to treat childhood diarrhea, B to encourage breastfeeding (which had declined precipitously due to working mothers and the marketing of infant formula), and I for immunization against the six basic childhood diseases: tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. (They added two Fs: food supplements and family planning; and, later, a third: female education.)}}

Of these, "immunization and ORT were seen as the 'twin-engines' of the child survival revolution".&lt;ref name=gautam/&gt;&lt;ref name="jim_grant_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jim Grant: UNICEF Visionary |author1=Peter Adamson |author2=Carol Bellamy |author3=Kul Gautam |author4=Richard Jolly |author5=Nyi Nyi |author6=Mary Racelis |author7=Richard Reid |author8=Jon Rohde |year=2001 |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_4402.html |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

After 1986, when studies by [[Alfred Sommer]] and others were published, [[vitamin A]] administration also became a focus.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

==Organizations involved==
Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations were involved.

* [[Rockefeller Foundation]]&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)
* [[World Bank]]
* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)
* [[Rotary International]] pledged to raise $120 million.&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Child Survival Revolution |author=[[D. A. Henderson]] |year=1990 |journal=Pediatric Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of mass media==
UNICEF took advantage of the growing levels of basic education and access to television and radio to generate support for the child survival revolution through persuasion.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt;

James Grant also "persuaded many heads of state to get personally involved in their national programmes for children, for example in their immunization by being photographed giving polio drops to a baby". Several figures from film and sports, like [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Liv Ullmann]], and [[Peter Ustinov]] also participated in the [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador program]].&lt;ref name=jim_grant_book/&gt;{{rp|62}}

[[File:Imf-advanced-un-least-developed-2008.svg|thumb|300px|Developed countries are shown in blue (according to the [[International Monetary Fund]], as of 2008)]]
In [[world systems theory]], the '''core countries''' are the [[industrialized]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries on which [[periphery countries]] and [[semi-periphery countries]] depend. Core countries control and benefit from the global market. They are usually recognized as wealthy nations with a wide variety of resources and are in a favorable location compared to other states. They have strong state institutions, a powerful military and powerful global political alliances.

Core countries do not always stay core permanently. Throughout history, core nations have been changing and new ones have been added to the core list. The most influential countries in the past have been what would be considered core. These were the [[Asia]]n, [[India]]n and [[Middle Eastern]] empires in the ages up to the 16th century, prominently India and [[China]] were the richest regions in the world until the 15th century, when the [[Europe]]an powers took the lead, although the major Asian powers such as China were still very influential in the region. Europe remained ahead of the pack until the 20th century, when the two [[World Wars]] turned disastrous for the European economies. It is then that the victorious [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]], up to late 1980s, became the two [[hegemons]], creating a bipolar [[New world order (politics)|world order]].
The heart of civilisation consists of [[Western Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australasia]] and [[Japan]]. The population of the core is by far the wealthiest and best educated on the planet.

== Definition ==
Core countries control and profit the most from the world system, and thus they are the "core" of the world system. These countries possess the ability to exercise control over other countries or groups of countries with several kinds of power such as military, economic, and political power.

The [[United States]], [[Canada]], the countries of the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are examples of present core countries that have the most power in the world economic system.&lt;ref name=essentials&gt;Margaret L.

Before the 13th century, many empires were considered to be "core" nations, such as the Persian, Indian, and Roman empires, the Muslim Caliphates, the Chinese and Egyptian dynasties, the various Mesopotamian kingdoms, and so on.

In Asia, the Chinese Empire was considered the middle kingdom and controlled the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sLxL3FkqCpIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=PbWzWwh343&amp;dq=chinese%20empire&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Steele, P. ''The Chinese Empire''. p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; The two empires communicated and traded through the [[Silk Route]], which takes its name from the extensive trade of [[Chinese silk]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, F.

[[India]] until the 13th century, often referred to as [[Greater India]], extended its religious, cultural, and trading influence on vast Asian regions from [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] to [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTw-nwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=India and Malaysia: Intertwined Strands|first=Veena|last=Sikri|date=16 December 2017|publisher=Manohar Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Buddhism and Hinduism, two of the most followed religions in Asia and the World as a whole, having originated there, India's cultural impact spread throughout Asia. A notable example is China, where Buddhism became the prominent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hftlEEV1J1oC|title=Buddhism in Chinese History|first=Arthur F.|last=Wright|date=16 December 2017|publisher=Stanford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanskrit]] was a prominent scholarly language in all the southeastern kingdoms until the 10th century C.E..

[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|left|alt=Expansion Of The Mongol Empire.|Expansion of the [[Mongol Empire]]]]

====Mongol Empire====
[[Pax Mongolica]] is a particularly important period which started in 1206 and ended, according to contradicting sources, between late 14th and early 15th centuries. The trade during this period took on a truly multi-continental dimension, efficient and safe trade routes were established, and many of the modern rules of trade were emerging. The [[Mongol Empire]] was the largest contiguous empire in the history of the world. It stretched from as far east as China all the way to Europe, taking up large parts of Central Asia, [[Middle East]], and [[India]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffZy5tDjaUkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=mongolian+empire&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fKkJTKvxC8X_lgewqZ3cDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false O'Brien, P.K. ''Atlas of World History'' p.98]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman territories acquired between 1481 and 1683 ([[List of Ottoman Empire dominated territories|see list of territories]])]]
Many trade routes went through the Mongol Empire territory, even though they were not the easiest ones to travel, due to the rough Asian terrain. Yet, they attracted many merchants, because these routes were relatively cheap and safe to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Abu—Lughod, J.L. ''Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250—1350'' p.154 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rYlgGU2SLiQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=before%20european%20hegemony&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mongols]] controlled their territories through military force and taxation. In many regions of the Mongol territory, Mongol rule is remembered as brutal and destructive. Yet, some argue that many economic and cultural improvements were made during the Mongol Empire's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/paxmongolica.shtml|title=Pax Mongolica|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|last=Lee|website=www.silk-road.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ottoman Empire====
The [[Ottoman Empire]], which emerged in 1299, quickly became a power to be reckoned with. By 1450, the Ottoman Empire took up the connecting territory between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Mediterranean seas]]. Despite lasting three times longer than the Mongol Empire, the Ottoman Empire never came to be anywhere near as expansive.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, C. ''Osman's Dream: The Story of the Ottoman Empire, 1300—1923'' p.3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=maT_XL3mgxwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ottoman%20empire&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th–18th century===
Prior to the 16th century, [[feudalism]] took over Western European society and pushed Western Europe on a road to capitalist development. Population and commerce grew rapidly within the feudal system during the years of 1150–1300. Through the years 1300–1450, an economic downfall came about.  The feudalism growth had come to an end.&lt;ref name=modernhistory&gt;Paul Halsall.
[http://teacher2.smithtown.k12.ny.us/jferrante/APWorld10/Handouts/wallerstein%20overview.pdf Modern History Sourcebook: Wallerstein on World Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308021951/http://teacher2.smithtown.k12.ny.us/jferrante/APWorld10/Handouts/wallerstein%20overview.pdf |date=2012-03-08 }}.Aug 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein|Wallerstein]], "the feudal crisis was most likely brought on by the involvement of the three following factors below:
# [[Agricultural production]] fell or remained stagnant. This meant that the burden of peasant producers increased as the ruling class expanded.
# The economic cycle of the feudal economy had reached its optimum level; afterward, the economy began to shrink. [[File:Western Europe 1700.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=A Map of Western Europe|A map of Western Europe]]
# A shift of [[Climatological|climatological conditions]] decreased agricultural productivity and contributed to an increase in epidemics within the population."&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

The feudal crisis lead to the development of the world economic system. The world economic system came about during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The most dominant of Northwestern Europe were [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]] (see map of Western Europe on the right). These countries took on the definition of a core country. They developed a strong central government, bureaucracies, and grew their military power. These countries were then able to control the international commerce and create a profit for themselves. All of western Europe attempted bureaucratization, [[Homogeneity|homogenization]] of the local population, development of a stronger military, and involvement of the country in a vast number of different economic activities.  After these attempts to gain the "core" status, north-western European states locked in their positions as core states by 1640.  England dominated the pack, as [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] fell to semi-peripheral status.&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

One factor that helped the core countries dominate over the other countries is long-distance trade with the Americas and the East.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This trade produced profits of 200–300%. In order to enter this trade market, countries needed a great amount of capital and state help.  The smaller countries could not make this happen, and this widened the gap between the "core" and "semi-periphery" countries. These core positions held strong up and throughout the 18th century, even as the core regions started to produce a mixture of agricultural and industrial goods. At the beginning of 1700, manufacture of goods in industrial productions started to take off. Industrial production soon took over the agricultural production up to the year 1900.&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

===18th–early 19th century===
As nations continued to grow technologically, especially through printing journals and newspapers, communication was more widespread. Thus, the global society was united through this force.&lt;ref&gt;Rosow, Stephen J. "Nature, Need, and the Human World; "Commercial Society" and the Construction of the World Economy." ''The Global Economy as Political Space''. p. 17. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RZPJK58IQ7IC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=economy+in+18th+century&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=economy%20in%2018th%20century&amp;f=false Link to Google Book]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to assure a good life for their citizens, countries needed to rely on trade and on [[Technological progress|technological advancements]], which ultimately determined how well in the world a country stood.&lt;ref&gt;Rosow, Stephen J. "Nature, Need, and the Human World; "Commercial Society" and the Construction of the World Economy." ''The Global Economy as Political Space''. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping in mind the interactions of nations in this period, John W. Cell notes in his essay entitled "Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850", that war and trade were somewhat dependent on each other. Nations had to defend their ships while also establishing territories elsewhere to ensure successful trade for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Cell, John W. " Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850." ''Asia in World History: Essays''. p. 448 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false Link to Google Book]&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 17th century, the "foundations of the modern world system had been laid."&lt;ref&gt;Cell, John W. " Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850." ''Asia in World History: Essays''. p. 445  [https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false Link to google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise and eventual European hegemony====
At the beginning of the 18th century, Europe had not yet dominated in the world economy on account of the fact that its military did not match that of Asia or of the Middle East. However, through organizing its economics and improving technology in industry, European countries took the lead as the most powerful nations in the late 18th century and remained in this position until late in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Cell_p445"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cell |first=John W. |title=Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850. |work=Asia in World History: Essays |page='''445''' |publisher=Some text available on Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, Asia was making and distributing goods that were valued by other areas, namely [[cotton]], [[silk]] and [[tea]]. Europe on the other hand, was not producing products of interest to the other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cell |first=John W. |title=Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850. |work=Asia in World History: Essays |page='''447''' |publisher=Some text available on Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, although Europe was wealthy, this dynamic shows that there may be a reversal of power because it was consistently expanding money, yet hardly bringing in currency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} America's crops were not initially appealing to Europeans. Tobacco's demand had to be advertised, and eventually Europe became interested in this particular plant. In time, there was rather regular [[wikt:transatlantic|trans-Atlantic]] trade between the Americas and Europe for such crops as tobacco, cotton, and also goods available in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Cell_p445"/&gt;

====Slave trade====
The 18th century was profoundly marked by the [[slave trade]]. [[History of slavery|Slavery was present]] in [[civilization]]s on all continents throughout post-hunter-gatherer history.  The importation of slaves from the Old World started on continental [[North America]] in August 1619 as a form of [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]], and continued in the next centuries. Slavery also occurred in [[Africa]] previous to Europeans capitalizing on selling slaves. Africans were sometimes hired to collect others off the coast, and bring them back to European ships.&lt;ref&gt;Cell, John W. " Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850." ''Asia in World History: Essays''. p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this trade, the dependent nations remained dependent as their [[populations]] were suffering from the slave trade.&lt;ref name="Inikori"&gt;Inikori, J.E. "Africa in World History: the Export Slave Trade From Africa and the Emergence of the Altlantic Economic Order." ''General History of Africa V; Africa from the sixteenth to eighteenth century.'' p.92.

This trade of humans was incredibly profitable for the Europeans, perpetuating their success and "rule" of the seas. Immediately following the early 19th century, the southern U.S. population consisted of 37.5% slaves.&lt;ref name="Inikori"/&gt;

===Early 19th century–present===
[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|300px|Map showing the [[British Empire]] in 1921]]
At the beginning of the 19th century, Europe still dominated as the core region of the world. [[France]] attempted to obtain European hegemony under the rule of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;Abernethy, David (2000).

In 1871, [[Germany]] became united and established themselves as the leading industrial nation on the European mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Abernethy, David (2000).

==Sociological theory==
The [[World Systems Theory]] argues that a nation's future is decided by their stance in the global economy. A global capitalistic market demands the needs for wealthy (core) states and poor (periphery) states. Core states benefit from the hierarchical structure of international trade and labor. World systems theory follows the logic that international wars or multinational financial disputes can be explained as attempts to change a location within the global market for a specific state or groups of states; these changes can have the objective to gain more control over the global market (to become a core country), while causing another nation to lose control over the world market. As the two groups grew apart in power, world systems theorists to established another group, the semi-periphery, to act as the middle group.&lt;ref name="theory"&gt;Ross, Robert J. S. and Kent C. Trachte. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FrFzvcrvOxMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=global+capitalism+the+new+leviathan&amp;ei=UoMJTIakC5WWyQTbjfSyBw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world%20systems%20theory%22&amp;f=false Global Capitalism: the New Leviathan'']] (p.51-54). Albany: State University of New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-7914-0339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref applies to the whole para--&gt;

[[Semi-periphery countries]] usually surround the core countries both in a physical and fundamental sense. The semi-periphery countries act as the middle men between the core and the periphery countries - by giving the wealthy countries what they receive from the poor countries. The [[periphery countries]] are the poorer countries usually specializing in farming and have access natural resources - which the core countries use to profit from.&lt;ref name="diversesociety"&gt;Anderson, Margaret L. and Howard F. Taylor. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA254 Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society]'' (p.254). Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 2007. {{ISBN|0-495-10236-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref applies to the whole para--&gt;

==Key qualifiers==
In order for a country to remain a core or to become a core, possible investors must be kept in mind when nation's policies are planned. Core countries change with time due to many different factors including changes in geographic favoritism and regional affluence. Alterations in financing plans by companies will also play a part as they change to react to the continuously evolving [[world economy|world market]].&lt;ref name=strategy&gt;Michalet, Charles Albert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPof5lBFnsC&amp;pg=PA22 Strategies of Multinationals and Competition for Foreign Direct Investment]'' (p.22-25). Washington D.C.: World Bank, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8213-4161-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a country to be considered a core country nominee, the country must possess an independent, stable government and potential for growth in the global market and advances in technology. Although these three factors will not completely decide where a company chooses to invest – they do play extremely large roles in such decisions. A main key to becoming or remaining a core is determined by the country's government policies to encourage funding from outside.&lt;ref name=strategy/&gt;

==Main functions==
The main function of the core countries is to command and financially benefit from the world system better than the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=diversesociety/&gt;  Core countries could also be viewed as the capitalist class while the periphery countries could be viewed as a disordered working class.&lt;ref name=revolution&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=btfwl-tX5r8C Revolution, a Sociological Interpretation]'' (p.100). Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1990.  {{ISBN|0-87722-736-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a capitalism-driven market, core countries exchange goods with the poor nations at an unequal rate greatly in favor of the core countries.&lt;ref name=enpolitical&gt;O’Hara, Phillip Anthony. ''[https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;id=ncgV5-fvEkoC Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2'']. London: T &amp; F Books, 2009. {{ISBN|0-203-44321-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The periphery countries’ purpose is to provide agricultural and natural resources along with the lower [[division of labor]] for larger corporations of semi-periphery and core countries. As a result of the lower priced division of labor and natural resources available, the core nations’ companies buy these products for a relatively low cost and then sell them for much higher. The periphery countries only receive low amounts of money for what they sell and must pay higher prices for anything they buy from outside their own region. Because of this continuous order, periphery countries can never earn enough to cover the costs of their imports while setting aside money to invest in better technologies. Core countries support this pattern by giving loans to the poor regions for specific investments in a raw material or type of agriculture, rather than help such regions establish themselves and balance out the world market.&lt;ref name=worldsystem&gt;Shannon, Thomas R. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U39evXuC41kC&amp;pg=PA16  An Introduction to the World-System Perspective]'' (p.16). Boulder: Westview Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8133-2452-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A disadvantage to core nations is to remain a member of the core grouping, the government must retain or create new policies that encourage investments to keep in their country and not relocate.&lt;ref name=worldsystem/&gt; This can make it difficult for governments to change national standards that may sacrifice high profits.

An example of a change that capitalism does not favor is the abolition of slavery. During the early [[industrialization]] and growth of America, exports produced by slaves played a huge role in making [[businesses]] the most profit.&lt;ref name=slavery&gt;Leiman, Melvin M. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-0SshE2MWREC&amp;pg=PA25 Political Economy of Racism''] (p.25-26). London: Pluto Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-7453-0487-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such movements to [[abolitionism in the United States|abolish slavery]] and spread equality caused an internal [[American Civil War|war]] within the United States.

Vanderpool wife, Laurie, is a speaker for Women's Retreats and [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible Studies]], and speaks frequently for Down Syndrome organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Staff.html |title=Staff |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203173807/http://www.livebeyond.org/Staff.html |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Vanderpool remained in Texas after residency and practiced as a vascular surgeon before moving to Brentwood, Tennessee in 2001 and opening his private practice Lave MD in 2003.

Dr. Vanderpool created Lave MD to act as both a medical facility and a spa. 
After the establishment of his international organization in 2005, Dr. Vanderpool used much of Lave MD's proceeds to fund the organization's efforts abroad.

==Medical missionary work==
In 2005, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the southeastern part of the United States, Dr. Vanderpool delivered healthcare across the Mississippi Coast out of a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Joanne |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20358101,00.html |title=Hope Out of the Rubble |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was to provide as much free healthcare as possible while the medical infrastructure could recover. Months later, Dr. Vanderpool established his organization, Medical Mobile Disaster Relief, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with goals to provide disaster relief through medical clinics, clean water projects, and micro-finance projects to areas hit by disasters. 
Vanderpool and the Mobile Medical Disaster Relief team began working in Mozambique in 2006. His goal was to provide healthcare to the indigenous people of the country in addition to enhancing the economy by implementing micro-finance projects among widows living in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Mozambique.html |title=Mozambique |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085936/http://www.livebeyond.org/Mozambique.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Dr. Vanderpool teamed up with the [[Belmont University|Belmont School of Nursing]] to construct a nursing curriculum that could teach the Mozambique women to be self-sufficient in caring for themselves and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashville.medicalnewsinc.com/physician-spotlight-david-vanderpool-md-cms-1943 |title=Physician Spotlight: David Vanderpool, MD on Nashville Medical News |publisher=Nashville.medicalnewsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanderpool and his Mobile Medical Disaster Relief partnered with PACODEP (Partners in Community Development) in Ghana in order to provide medical care, educate the locals on water purification and distribute water purifiers. PACODEP works to free enslaved children who are trafficked through Ghana for purposes of fishing work. Dr. Vanderpool has also partnered with local hospitals in Ghana in order to provide free invasive surgeries to these rescued children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Ghana.html |title=Ghana |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090632/http://www.livebeyond.org/Ghana.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Vanderpool partnered with Mission Lazarus in 2009 to build a sustainable medical clinic in [[Cedeño, Honduras]]. Given sufficient medical supplies and equipment, Vanderpool allowed Mission Lazarus to take over the clinic and provision of healthcare for the people of Cedeño.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Honduras.html |title=Honduras |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085736/http://www.livebeyond.org/Honduras.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live Beyond in Haiti===
Dr. Vanderpool shifted his focus in the aftermath of the [[Haiti earthquake 2010|earthquake]] that devastated the entire country of Haiti in 2010. In 2010, Vanderpool officially changed the name of his organization from Mobile Medical Disaster Relief to Live Beyond with a stated mission to be "an organization that chooses to Live Beyond...ourselves, our culture, our borders and this life so that others can Live Beyond…disease, hunger, poverty and despair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti.html |title=Haiti |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085813/http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial aid Vanderpool and his team brought to Haiti was primarily mobile medical care to relieve the thousands devastated and injured by the earthquake. Since then however, Vanderpool has grounded his missionary work in Thomazeau, Haiti where his organization began building a base. Vanderpool continued to provide free medical care, establishing a surgical hospital and clinic. In addition, clean water projects, orphanages, and other widow and orphan advocacy projects were begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti-Base.html |title=Haiti Base |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090459/http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti-Base.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Dr. Vanderpool is a Christian, who combines religion and the spread of his faith with his medical work. In Haiti, he has made it one of his objectives to bring Haiti away from its traditional voodoo culture and provide "spiritual guidance" to the Haitians in the role of Christianity, with the belief that Christianity will lead to a better Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acuoptimist.com/2010/11/alumni-join-fight-against-cholera-in-haiti/ |title=Alumni join fight against Haiti cholera outbreak &amp;#124; The Optimist |publisher=Acuoptimist.com |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085616/http://www.acuoptimist.com/2010/11/alumni-join-fight-against-cholera-in-haiti/ |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to moving to Haiti, each medical outreach trip made by Vanderpool and other Live Beyond participants included prayer and Christian ministry along with healthcare to the voodoo priests, island chiefs, idol worshipers and the sick and dying in Haiti. On the Live Beyond site, Vanderpool's religious impact since being in Haiti has been characterized as leading to the baptism of dozens, the saving of tribes through "Bibles being read in their own languages" and "the Kingdom is being expanded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Our-Mission.html |title=Our-Mission |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085458/http://www.livebeyond.org/Our-Mission.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Dr. Vanderpool promotes religious missionary work in tandem with his medical relief and sustainable development efforts. A worship center is being built in Thomazeau, Haiti and monthly mission trips are promoted and scheduled for Americans to travel to Thomazeau and volunteer.

Initiatives like [[Earth Day]] promote international cooperation on pro-environmental initiatives, or in other words – promote environmental globalization.]]
'''Environmental globalization'''  refers to the internationally coordinated practices and regulations (often in the form of [[international treaties]]) regarding [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt; An example of environmental globalization would be the series of International Tropical Timber Agreement treaties ([[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006|2006]]), establishing [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] and promoting [[sustainable management]] of [[tropical forests]]. Environmental globalization is usually supported by [[non-governmental organization]]s and governments of [[developed countries]], but opposed by governments of [[developing countries]] which see pro-environmental initiatives as hindering their economic development.

==Definitions and characteristics==
[[Karl S. Zimmerer]] defined it as "the increased role of globally organized management institutions, knowledge systems and monitoring, and coordinated strategies aimed at resource, energy, and conservation issues."&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl S. Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdLK-UGj7YkC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Grainger]] in turn wrote that it can be understood as "an increasing spatial uniformity and contentedness in regular environmental management practices".&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K. Gills|title=The Globalization of Environmental Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EULjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96896-2|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Yearley]] has referred to this concept as "globalization of environmental concern".&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-246"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA246|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grainger also cited a study by Clark (2000), which he noted was an early treatment of the concept, and distinguished three aspects of environmental globalization: "global flows of energy, materials and organisms; formulation and global acceptance of ideas about global environment; and [[environmental governance]]" (a growing web of institutions concerned with global environment).&lt;ref name=Grainger/&gt;

Environmental globalization is related to [[economic globalization]], as economic development on a global scale has environmental impacts on such scale, which is of concern to numerous organizations and individuals.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BenyonDunkerley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Benyon|author2=David Dunkerley|title=Globalization: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doB9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78240-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; While economic globalization has environmental impacts, those impacts should not be confused with the concept of environmental globalization.&lt;ref name=Grainger&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/abstract|title=Environmental Globalization|last=Grainger|first=Alan|date=1 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470670590|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regards, environmental globalization is in direct opposition to economic globalization, particularly when the latter is described as encouraging trade, and the former, as promoting pro-environment initiatives that are an impediment to trade.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"/&gt; For that reason, an environmental activist might be opposed to economic globalization, but advocate environmental globalization.&lt;ref name="DobratzWaldner2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Betty Dobratz|author2=Lisa K Waldner|author3=Timothy Buzzell|title=Power, Politics, and Society: An Introduction to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoK9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346|date=14 October 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34529-9|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grainger has discussed that environmental globalization in the context of international agreements on pro-environmental initiatives. According to him, precursors to modern environmental globalization can be found in the [[colonial era]] [[forestry|scientific forestry]] (research into how to create and restore forests).&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K. Gills|title=The Globalization of Environmental Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EULjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96896-2|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern initiatives contributing to environmental globalization include the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]],&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-58"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K. Gills|title=The Globalization of Environmental Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EULjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96896-2|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; came from the [[World Bank]] 1980s requirements that development projects need to protect indigenous peoples and conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-59"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K. Gills|title=The Globalization of Environmental Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EULjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96896-2|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of such initiative include treaties such as the series of International Tropical Timber Agreement treaties ([[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006|2006]]).&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

Stearns|title=Globalization in World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVOOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=20 October 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-25993-8|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Steven Yearley states that it was around that time that the [[environmental movement]] started to organize on the international scale focus on the global dimension of the issues (the first [[Earth Day]] was celebrated on 1970).&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA240|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters and opponents==
According to Grainger, environmental globalization (in the form of pro-environmental international initiatives) is usually supported by various [[non-governmental organization]]s&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

[[World Trade Organization]] has also been criticized as focused on economic globalization (liberalizing trade) over concerns of environmental protection, which are seen as impeding the trade.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-247"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA247|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-248"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA248|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Yearley states that WTO should not be described as "anti-environmental", but its decisions have major impact on environment worldwide, and they are based primarily on economic concerns, with environmental concerns being given secondary weight.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-250"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA250|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIH World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[field hockey]]. The teams of the member nations of [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH), field hockey's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results. The rankings were introduced in October 2003.&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;{{cite news|title=FIH to introduce world rankings|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/03/stories/2003090300141900.htm|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the rankings ==
The rankings were introduced to overcome the criticism of fixing when drawing the pools for each tournament. It also determines the quotas for tournaments such as the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and also the [[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref name=system&gt;{{cite web|title=FIH World Ranking System|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/World%20Ranking/World%20Ranking%20Explanatory%20note.pdf|work=International Hockey Federation|publisher=FIH.ch|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation method ==
=== Overview ===
All of the FIH-recognised, including qualifying and continental tournaments for last four years are included in ranking points calculation. However, the past results will be deducted by the percentage set by the FIH as shown by the tabulated below.

{| class=wikitable

=== Continental championships ===
FIH had set the total allocated points for continental tournament. However, a different percentage was set to differ the standard of regional field hockey. Currently, only Europe had full 100% points allocation for all classification while the others had only several finishers with full points allocation. Africa is the sole continent with neither men's or women's tournament had full points allocation.

[[Image:Four continents.png|thumb|The classical four continents]]

Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into '''four continents''': [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nothing was known of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], first sighted in the early seventeenth century, or  [[Antarctica]], first sighted in the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the four [[continents]] was seen to represent its quadrant of the world&amp;mdash;Europe in the north, Asia in the east, Africa in the south, and America in the west. This division fit the [[Renaissance]] sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four [[season]]s, four [[classical element]]s, four [[cardinal directions]], four classical [[virtues]], etc.

The '''four parts of the world'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ciappara|first=Frans|date=1998|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/4672/1/4672_2141.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|title=Society and inquisition in Malta 1743-1798|publisher=Durhem E-Theses|location=[[Durham University]]|page=38|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''four corners of the world''' refers to the [[Americas]] (the "west"), [[Europe]] (the "north"), [[Asia]] (the "east"), and [[Africa]] (the "south"). 

==A three-cornered world==
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|The ancient tripartite view of the world]]
Before the discovery of the [[New World]] a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the "three parts" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As [[Laurent de Premierfait]], the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the [[Orient]] as far as the rising sun (''"devers le [[Levant|souleil levant]]"''&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt;), towards the south ("midi") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at [[Mare Nostrum|our sea]], and towards the north ("[[septentrional|septentrion]]") it ends in the [[Maeotian marshes]] and the river named ''[[Tanais|Thanaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Asie est l'une des trois parties du monde que les auteurs divisent en Asie, Afrique et Europe. Asie se extend devers orient jusques a souleil&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt; [[levant]], devers midi elle fine a la grant mer devers occident elle fine a notre mer, et devers septentrion elle fine aux paluz Meotides et au fleuve appellé Thanaus''; Laurent de Premierfait's expanded translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' (1409), quoted in Patricia M. Gathercole, "Laurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium" ''The French Review'' '''27'''.4 (February 1954:245-252) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:EuropaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''Europa:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

==A fourth corner: the enlarged world==
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at "our sea", the [[Mediterranean]]; Europeans were only dimly aware of the [[Ural Mountains]], which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or [[craton]]s. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the [[Hellespont]], which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the [[Age of Discovery]], Asia began beyond the Hellespont with [[Asia Minor]], where the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] had lain, and stretched away to unimaginably exotic and distant places&amp;mdash; "the [[Orient]]".

In the sixteenth century [[Americas|America]] too was full of exotic promise: the "[[New World]]".&lt;ref&gt;This theme is extensively explored in Hugh Honour, ''The New Golden Land: European Images of America from the Discoveries to the Present'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Cesare Ripa]] published a book of emblems for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times. It was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. The illustrations reveal fixed Eurocentric perceptions of the nature of the "four corners of the world." Ripa's ''Europe'' (''illustration, left'') is the land of abundance (cornucopia) of kings and the pope, whose crowns and the papal tiara lie at her feet, and of cities.
[[Image:AsiaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Asia:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia,'' 1603]]
''Africa'', by contrast (''illustration, below right'') wears the elephant headdress (worn by rulers depicted on Hellenistic [[Bactria]]n coins) and is accompanied by a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands and [[Cleopatra]]'s [[asp (reptile)|asps]]. ''Asia'' (''illustration, right''), the seat of Religion, carries a smoking [[censer]] as a camel takes its ease.
[[Image:AmericaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''America'', woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]
And the iconic image of ''America'' (''illustration, below left'') shows a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] maiden in a feathered headdress, with [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled [[Amazons|Amazon]] from the river that already carried the name.

The American millionaire philanthropist [[James Hazen Hyde]], who inherited a majority share in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the [[New-York Historical Society]]; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various [[New York City]] museums.
[[Image:AfricaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Africa'': woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents.
The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] in the [[Piazza Navona]] in Rome.

With the confirmed discovery that [[Australia]] was an island continent, the theme of the "Four Continents" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], was discovered. The iconography survived as the '''Four Corners of the World''', however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] (1907), four sculptural groups by [[Daniel Chester French]] symbolize the "Four Corners of the World."

The '''General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans''' ('''GEBCO''') is a publicly available [[bathymetric chart]] of the world's [[ocean]]s. The project was conceived with the aim of preparing a global series of charts showing the general shape of the seafloor. Over the years it has become a reference map of the bathymetry of the world’s oceans for scientists and others.

==Organisation==
GEBCO operates under the joint auspices of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/committees-wg/ircc/gebco/gebco.html IHO Committees &amp; Working Groups listing for the GEBCO Guiding Committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525093743/http://iho-ohi.net/english/committees-wg/ircc/gebco/gebco.html |date=2009-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] (IOC) of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ioc-unesco.org/index.php?option=com_oe&amp;task=viewDocumentRecord&amp;docID=2035 IOC/EC-XLI/2 Annex 8, Terms of Reference and Rules of Procedure of the Technical Sub-committee on Ocean Mapping (TSCOM), Sub-committee on Undersea Features Names (SCUFN) and Joint IHO–IOC GEBCO Guiding Committee, Authored by the IOC Secretariat, Published on 26/05/08]&lt;/ref&gt; Its work is done by an international group of experts in seafloor mapping who develop a range of bathymetric data sets and data products.

==Data sets and products==
[[Image:gebco atlantic.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic Ocean]] 3D visualization]]
[[Image:Gebco 3D antarctic.jpg|thumb|[[Southern Ocean|Antarctic Ocean]] 3D visualization]]

Although originally GEBCO published paper [[contour line|contour charts]], today it has moved into the digital age and collects digital depths of the ocean from wherever they are available. GEBCO provides a range of bathymetric data sets and data products, including:

*Global gridded bathymetric data sets:
**GEBCO_08 Grid — a global bathymetric grid with 30 arc-second spacing, generated by combining quality-controlled ship depth soundings with interpolation between sounding points guided by satellite-derived gravity data.
**GEBCO_2014 Grid — an update to the previously released GEBCO_08 Grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/gebco_30_second_grid/#history Update history of the GEBCO 30 arc-second grid]&lt;/ref&gt;
**GEBCO One Minute Grid — a global grid at one arc-minute intervals, based largely on the most recent set of bathymetric contours contained within the GEBCO Digital Atlas.
The grids are available to download from the [[British Oceanographic Data Centre]] ([[BODC]]) in the form of netCDF files, along with free software for displaying and accessing data in ASCII and netCDF. The grids can be used with the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) system.
*The GEBCO Digital Atlas — a two volume CDROM set which contains:
**The GEBCO One Minute Grid
**A global set of digital bathymetric contours and coastlines
**The GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names: a digital gazetteer of undersea feature names.
**A software interface for viewing and accessing the data sets
*The GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names — a digital gazetteer of undersea feature names used on sheets and products of GEBCO and Regional International Bathymetric Charts (IBC) projects, and on international (INT) nautical charts. It is available to be downloaded from the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).
*The GEBCO world map — a global, coloured, paper map of the bathymetry of the world's oceans based upon the GEBCO One Minute Grid. The map is available to be downloaded in the form of [[JPEG]] file.

==Project history==

The GEBCO chart series was initiated in 1903 by an international group of [[geographer]]s and oceanographers, under the leadership of [[Prince Albert I of Monaco]]. At that time there was an explosion of interest in the study of the natural world and this group recognized the importance of a set of maps describing the shape of the ocean floor. The first hundred years of the project were described in the book ''The History of GEBCO 1903-2003'' published by GITC in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/history_of_gebco/ ''The History of GEBCO 1903-2003''] published by GITC in 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays GEBCO’s role has become increasingly important, due to the increased interest in the oceans for scientific research and for the exploitation and conservation of resources.

Since 1903, five separate editions of paper, bathymetric contour charts covering the whole world have been produced. GEBCO is now maintained in digital form as the GEBCO Digital Atlas.

==Training==

The [[Nippon Foundation]] of Japan has provided funding for GEBCO to train a new generation of scientists and hydrographers in ocean bathymetry. The 12-month course, leading to a Postgraduate Certificate in Ocean Bathymetry (PCOB), has been held at the [[University of New Hampshire]], USA, since 2004. 60 GEBCO scholars from 31 different countries have completed the course and are supporting GEBCO programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15993">The '''Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network''' ('''GOARN''') is a network composed of numerous technical and public health institutions, laboratories, NGOs, and other organizations that work to observe and respond to threatening epidemics.&lt;ref name="IHRGOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/about/IHR_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_respond.pdf |title=International Health Regulations Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |date=1 May 2015 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOARN works closely with and under the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which is one of its most notable partners. Its goals are to: examine and study diseases, evaluate the risks that certain diseases pose, and improve international capability to deal with diseases.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network-GOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/goarnenglish.pdf |title=The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

The [[World Health Organization]] realized at the start of the 21st century that it did not have the resources required to adequately respond to and prevent epidemics around the world. Thus, a "Framework for Global Outbreak and Response" was created by the Department of Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Response, and Regional Offices. This framework was put then forth in a meeting in Geneva from April 26–28, 2000. In this meeting, which was attended by 121 representatives from 67 institutions, the decision was made to form GOARN to contribute resources, coordination, surveillance, and technical assistance towards combating diseases.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |date=4 September 2014 |journal=Global Public Health |author=John S. Mackenzie |pmc=4205922 |pmid=25186571 |doi=10.1080/17441692.2014.951870 |volume=9 |pages=1023–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided that GOARN would be directed by a steering committee made of 20 representatives of GOARN partners and an operational support team (OST) based in WHO. The steering committee oversees and plans the activities of GOARN, and the OST is composed of a minimum of 5–6 WHO staff. Task forces and groups were established to deal with specific issues.&lt;ref name="Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response._Report_of_a_WHO_Meeting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/surveillance/whocdscsr2003.pdf |title=Global Outbreak Alert and Response. Report of a WHO meeting |date=26 April 2000 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOARN resources are primarily coordinated by the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network" /&gt;

==Goals==

The WHO's guiding principles are to standardize "epidemiological, laboratory, clinical management, research, communication, logistics, support, security, evacuation, and communication systems" and coordinative international resources to support local efforts by GOARN partners to combat outbreaks. It also focuses on improving long term ability to provide technical assistance to affected areas.&lt;ref name="Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response._Report_of_a_WHO_Meeting" /&gt;

==Partners==

GOARN has grown to now have over 600 partners in the form of public health institutions, networks, laboratories, and [[United Nations]] and non-governmental organizations. Technical institutions, networks, and organizations that have the ability to improve GOARN's capabilities are eligible for partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/alert_and_response/outbreak-network/en/ |title=Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its partners, GOARN is staffed by a variety of individuals who specialize in public health, such as "doctors, nurses, infection control specialists, logisticians, laboratory specialists; communication, anthropology and social mobilization experts, emergency management and public health professionals among others."&lt;ref name="Partners:Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_(GOARN)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title=Partners: Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its biggest partner, WHO plays a large role in GOARN. Alongside coordinating its resources to combat outbreaks, WHO provides much of the staffing and assistance for GOARN, though as will be covered later, does not fund GOARN directly. Since the network is primarily led by the WHO, there is some uncertainty as to whether WHO should be considered a partner in GOARN or if the network should be considered a WHO initiative.

Another notable partner is the [[Center for Disease Control]], which sends technical resources and staff to GOARN. The CDC also has a history of resource sharing and cooperation with WHO in order to combat disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_t-iBC3LiEC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;lpg=PA433&amp;dq=GOARN+CDC&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=isv4GUkBWC&amp;sig=w-0SZ3lZH7ZEMrEU9mLTXWDLUjQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr6eGd6uTOAhUOzGMKHf-xAicQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases |date=28 April 2011 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |accessdate=30 August 2016 |author1=Kenneth H. Mayer  |author2=H.F. Pizer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==

The WHO does not directly fund GOARN. Instead, GOARN members and outside fundraising that is carried out each time there is a new incidence is used to support the GOARN response. The [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] provides GOARN with US$500,000 as a revolving fund, meant to be used for quickly mobilizing response teams. This is known as the WHO-NTI Global Emergency Response Fund, and must be repaid after withdrawal. The GOARN is effective at operating from a fairly small budget.&lt;ref name="Exploring the international arena of global public health surveillance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/1/2.full |title=Exploring the international arena of global public health surveillance |date=28 September 2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=30 August 2016 |author=Philippe Calain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field missions==

GOARN has responded to over 120 occurrences in 85 countries and has deployed over 2,300 experts into the field.&lt;ref name="Partners:Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_(GOARN)" /&gt; Some examples of deployments are the SARS outbreak in Asia in 2003, Rift Valley fever, and the nipah virus around the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name="CDC Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/pdfs/atlanta/john_mackenzie.pdf |title=GOARN and One Health: Nipahvirus as a source of lessons learnt |date=26 April 2000 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=4 September 2016 |author=John S. Mackenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field missions overview===

Since its creation, GOARN cooperated with various other organizations to control outbreaks and improve national capacity to respond to diseases. A brief history of GOARN's work against international diseases is as follows. In 2000–2003, GOARN primarily responded to outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, meningitis, and yellow fever in Africa. It supported field investigation and outbreak containment. In 2003, GOARN helped to deploy international teams and helped to coordinate the response against SARS. In 2004, the network was one of the first to deploy against H5N1 influenza. In April–July 2005, GOARN helped to control Marburg Hemorrhagic fever in Angola. It carried out some "risk assessment and preparedness missions" in 2006, along with some response to human bird flu. In 2008/2009, GOARN responded to cholera in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="Independent_Evaluation_of_GOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/publications/WHO_HSE_GCR_GOARN_2011_2.pdf |title=Independent Evaluation of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |date=1 April 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 October 2016 |author1=Egbert Sondorp |author2=Christoper Ansell |author3=Robert Hartley Stevens |author4=Emma Denton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and SARS===

GOARN played a role in containing the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia. The network sent teams of experts in epidemiology, microbiology/virology, and infection control to Hanoi, Vietnam in March 14, 2003 and then Beijing China in March 25, 2003. GOARN assisted during this outbreak to not only study the outbreak and provide assistance, but also facilitate communication between the [[Department of Health (Hong Kong)]] and the WHO.&lt;ref name="SARS_Operational_Update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/sars/goarn/en/ |title=Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Operational Update |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earliest signs of the outbreak in China were reported February 11–24, when multiple people were reported to contract the disease. WHO was notified February 28 and then directly notified GOARN March 13. The first members of a WHO/GOARN outbreak control team arrived in Hong Kong March 14, followed by another 5-person GOARN team 12 days later. This second team transitioned to Guangdong, where they investigated the earliest cases of SARS and conducted interviews with health staff. The outbreak was declared by WHO to be contained by July 5.&lt;ref name="SARS_Chronology"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/ |title= Update 95-SARS: Chronology of a serial killer |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate= 30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, GOARN carried out many of the operations for the initial response to SARS through the mobilization of field teams. Also through GOARN, the WHO developed many international networks to create tools and standards for containing the epidemic. These networks communicated data by teleconference and use of secure websites for sharing of information.

Besides these networks and field teams, GOARN also assisted nations by directly providing assistance to affected areas and improving their capacity to respond to such threats in the future. GOARN's role in the outbreak was recognized by the World Health Assembly during the 56th Assembly in resolution WHA56.29.&lt;ref name="WHO_Response_to_SARS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92476/ |title=The WHO Response to SARS and Preparations for the Future |publisher= National Academies Press |accessdate= 30 October 2016 |author1=J.S.

Slattery |author11=G. Thomson |author12=D. Werker |author13=M. Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and Ebola===

On March 23, 2014, the first reports of Ebola in Guinea were reported by WHO's Regional Office in Africa. Five days later, the first GOARN team was sent to Guinea. This team found the situation to be quite severe and its findings were discussed in a press conference in Geneva April 8.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/one-year-report/who-response/en/ |title=Key Events in the WHO Response to the Ebola outbreak |date=1 January 2015 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third week of April, WHO collaborated with GOARN to send a new medical team trained in infection prevention/control and intensive care to Guinea's principal hospital, Donka Hospital. Two weeks later, on May 5, WHO deployed experts, thirty three of whom were from GOARN, to West Africa to assist in the response to the outbreak. The outbreak was detected to have spread to Sierre Leone later in the month.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola" /&gt;

On June 23, a GOARN steering committee session sent a message to WHO requesting for WHO to lead the response more strongly because it was the only agency with the resources and staff to do so.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola" /&gt;

Over the course of the outbreak, the network deployed 895 experts, including "doctors, nurses, infection control specialists, logisticians, laboratory specialists; communication, anthropology and social mobilisation experts, emergency management and public health professionals." The network is still involved in the response to Ebola.&lt;ref name="GOARN_EBOLA_2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title= Partners: Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate= 30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and cholera===
In Sierre Leone, GOARN has sent case management and laboratory experts from the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh]] to help train the response capacity of health care and laboratory workers case management and diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Cholera_Sierra_Leone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title=Cholera in Sierra Leone-update (8 October 2012) |date=8 October 2012 | publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Iraq, the [[Syrian Civil War]] displaced many refugees into the Kurdistan. The refugee camps suffer from poor sanitation, which has led to cholera outbreaks in the region in 2007 and 2012. GOARN, as per the request of the [[Ministry of Health (Iraq)|Ministry of Health of Iraq]] for support and training in outbreak response, deployed a multidisciplinary team of six experts to the Northern Iraqian Dohuk and Erbil camps to assist with assessing the risk of cholera and other diseases as well as assisting MoH to prepare for response to the diseases.&lt;ref name="Northern_Iraq_Cholera"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ghdonline.org/yp-chronic/discussion/whogoarn-request-for-technical-assistance-for-chol/ |title=WHO/GOARN Request for technical assistance for Cholera Control in Northern Iraq |date=21 May 2014 |publisher=GHDonline |accessdate=30 October 2016 |author=Shushmita Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and H1N1===

GOARN supported countries and various other outbreak control organizations to fight against the H1N1 outbreak in the US and Mexico. The GOARN alert and request for assistance started in Mexico April 24, 2009. Over the course of the outbreak, GOARN helped the [[Pan American Health Organization]] coordinate and exchange information with the CDC and [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]. It was provided with support and training from the Regional Office for the Western Pacific Response so that it could support regional offices in Manila and carry out field missions in Malaysia and Mongolia. The network carried out a joint training course with the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean in Cairo.&lt;ref name="H1N1_and_GOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/h1n1_donor_032011.pdf |title=Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All in all, GOARN carried out 188 missions to 27 countries to strengthen international coordination between these organizations and to improve international capacity to respond to threats. Its activities consisted of assessment of the situation, communication between partners, infection control, laboratory diagnostic, and transportation of specimens.&lt;ref name="H1N1_and_GOARN" /&gt;

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Global education''' is a set of ideas taught to enhance one's perception of the world. It is taught within the curriculum where teachers integrate multiple dimensions, perspectives, and citizenships into everyday lessons. It began as an undertaking to restructure education and society in the 1960s and 1970s, through the initiatives of educationalists, NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. This global approach seeks to break an educational program that is stuck in subject knowledge and national culture, and instead, seeks to discover alternative motivations for education and alternate futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Standish|first=Alex|date=2014|title=What is global education and where is it taking us?|journal=The Curriculum Journal|volume=25|issue=2|pages=166–186|doi=10.1080/09585176.2013.870081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emphasizes the unity and interdependence of human society, developing a sense of self and appreciation of cultural diversity, affirmation of social justice and human rights, as well as building peace and actions for a sustainable future at different times and places. This approach is also believed to promote positive values and prods students to take responsibility for their actions and see themselves as global citizens who can contribute to a more peaceful, just and sustainable world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globaleducation.edu.au/global-education/what-is-global-ed.html|title=What is global education? {{!}} Global Education|website=www.globaleducation.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's literature ==
Evidence based practices have shown that literature can help children learn about global issues. By exploring diversity in text, connecting the literature to service learning and activism, promote critical thinking about themselves in the global community, and develop their global awareness with literacy elements.

== Technology ==
Technology is a key provider in learning about globalization and participating in the global community. Technology can be used in the classroom to communicate around the world, establish global relationships, learn more about global current events, and developing global research. The advancements of technology will have a positive impact of global education in primary schools and higher education schools.&lt;ref&gt;'''Mapping the future: The future of education. (n.d.).

== Service learning ==
Service learning or local volunteer service work are included in conceptualized [[global citizenship]] programs. This approach is criticized because global relations are dramatically split into rich and poor, or oppressor and oppressed, respectively. Experiences of oppression are more complex than experiences of oppressing. [[Global citizenship education]] includes connecting nearby and worldwide issues and points of view and may incorporate such themes as human rights, social equity, and citizenship instruction, economic improvement, and globalization. Service learning can carry the possibility to recreate social disparities and advance, instead of dissipate, stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Aktas, Fatih, et al. “Institutionalizing Global Citizenship.” Journal of Studies in International Education, vol. 21, no. 1, 2016, pp. 65–80., doi:10.1177/1028315316669815.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P. Karns and Karen A. Mingst | year=2009 | location=[[Boulder, CO]] | page=633 | isbn=978-1-58826-698-9 | url=https://www.rienner.com/title/International_Organizations_The_Politics_and_Processes_of_Global_Governance_2nd_edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998. Eine Weltorganisation für Umwelt und Ent-wicklung: Ein Vorschlag [A world organization for environment and development: A proposal]. Universitas. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Wissenschaft 53 (627), pp. 822–31.&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J.P., forthcoming 2012. Environmental Governance. Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, S., and Biermann, F., 2005. The debate on a World Environment Organization: An introduction.  A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?, Aldershot: Ashgate, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega-conferences’&lt;ref&gt;Seyfang, G. and Jordan, A., 2002. “Mega” Environmental Conferences: vehicles for effective, long term environmental planning?, in: S. Stokke, and O. Thommesen, (eds) Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Earthscan: London: 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g.[[Rio Summit]] and [[Earth Summit 2002]]).

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992. New Ways To Make International Environmental Law, American Journal of International Law, 86(2), pp. 259–83. and Voynet, D., 2000.

Global Initiative on Sustainable Development. Department of Foreign Affairs (South Africa, 23 June).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that the current decentralised, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"&gt;Lodefalk, M., and Whalley, J., 2002. Reviewing Proposals for a World Environment Organization. The World Economy 25 (5) pp. 601–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance;&lt;ref&gt;Najam, A., 2003. The Case against a New International Environmental Organization. Global Governance 9 (3) pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S., 1998. Ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems 1 pp. 431–36&lt;/ref&gt; while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Oberthür, S. and Gehring, T., 2004. Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfutureonline.org/PolicyAdvocacy/GlblFutr.nsf/issues/92F9DA0279CC03A28825738B0019CDEC?OpenDocument|title=globalfutureonline.org - This website is for sale! - Global Future world vision human development child rights poverty aids peace conflict global Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.globalfutureonline.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015. [http://e-publications.une.edu.au/1959.11/18560 ''Fixing global governance''], Online Opinion, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blockchain]] and decentralized platforms can be considered as hyper-political and Global governance tools, capable to manage social interactions on large scale and dismiss traditional central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=083008085091002109121009065100004023014014073092023027101003105086026068106093094125028029021119038017111106028120127023006025122075014092018092000116116089077006022040064023094030088126123026089120094115011009112098106023016006031019067125067008114064&amp;EXT=pdf] ''Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?
 [[SSRN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global silver trade''' between the Americas and [[Europe]] from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries was a spillover of the [[Columbian Exchange]] which had a profound effect on the world economy. In fact, many scholars consider the [[silver]] trade to mark the beginning of a genuinely [[global economy]], with one historian noting that silver "went round the world and made the world go round."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age|last=Frank|first=Andre G.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although global, much of that silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese, as they accepted it as a form of currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China’s Seventeenth Century Monetary Crisis|url=|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=2|pages=132|quote=... silver wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural center.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the global economic changes the silver trade engendered, it also put into motion a wide array of political transformations in the early modern era. "New World mines," concluded several prominent historians "supported the Spanish empire," acting as a linchpin of the Spanish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a 'Silver Spoon'|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaniards at the time of the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the [[Potosí]] silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Potosí's deposits were rich and Spanish American silver mines were the world's cheapest sources of it. The Spanish acquired the silver, minting it into the peso de ocho (a currency) to then use it as a means of purchase; that currency was so widespread that even the United States accepted it as valid until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=011/llsl011.db&amp;recNum=184|title=A Century of Lawmaking|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Spanish need for silver increased, new innovations for more efficient extraction of silver were developed, such as the amalgamation method of using [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to extract silver from ore.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the two centuries that followed the discovery of Potosí, the Spanish silver mines in the Americas produced 40,000 tons of silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silver, Trade, and War: Spain and America in the Making of Early Modern Europe|last=Stein|first=Stanley J.|last2=Stein|first2=Barbara H.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, more than 150,000 tons of silver were shipped from Potosí by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/potosi-silver-mines|title=Potosí Silver Mines|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80%&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh062p201.pdf|journal=Journal of World History|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the world's silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China (largely because of British merchants who used it to purchase exotic Chinese commodities).  In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting heavily into China and the foreign trade at large.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As has been demonstrated, China dominated silver imports. The market value of silver in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] territory was double its value elsewhere, which provided great arbitrage profit for the Europeans and Japanese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The abundance of silver in China made it easy for the country to mint it into coinage. That process was so widespread that local Chinese government officials would demand taxes to be paid in silver to the point that silver eventually backed all of [[China's economy]].

==First paper money==
The world's first [[paper money]] ("[[flying money]]") was invented by the Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Weksel: Bill of Exchange and Promissory Note|last=Moshenskyi|first=Sergii|publisher=Xlibris|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they needed some commodity to back it. Traditional coins were useful, but the amount of coins needed for large purchases could be bulky and dangerous to transport. That problem was solved when the Chinese created small pieces of paper with pictures of the coin printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Money|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|publisher=Crown Business|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the nature of their geography, China had no real amount of precious metals of their own to back the paper money they invented. Because the Spaniards didn't find gold but did find copious amounts of silver, the Spaniards and the rest of Europe used this silver to purchase the commodities of choice from China, solving both of their problems.&lt;ref name="columbia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s5/s5_4.html |title=China and Europe, 1500–2000 and Beyond: What is Modern? |publisher=Afe.easia.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silver in the Americas ==
[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|thumb|Silver Peso of Philip V]]
A result of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] was the discovery, production, and trade of precious metals. The Spanish, along with other European nations, had a great desire for Chinese goods such as [[silk industry in China|silk]] and [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078638|journal=Journal of World History|volume=6|issue=2|pages=201–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reorient|last=Frank|first=Andre|publisher=|year=July 1998|isbn=9780520214743|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most important mining colonies of the [[Spanish Empire]] were Peru and Mexico, who were estimated to have provided one-hundred thousand tons of silver from the mid 16th Century to the end of the colonial period.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Richard L.|date=1988|title=Long-Term Silver Mining Trends in Spanish America: A Comparative Analysis of Peru and Mexico|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1863529|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=93|issue=4|pages=898–935|doi=10.2307/1863529}}&lt;/ref&gt; The richest, and most productive mine in the Americas was that of [[Potosí]] in what is modern day Bolivia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The richest camp in Mexico was in the city of Zacatecas, however the production of this mine was far less than that of Potosi.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Mining Processes in the Americas ===
More simplistic native mining techniques dominated American mining for the early part of the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brading|first=D. A.|last2=Cross|first2=Harry E.|date=1972|title=Colonial Silver Mining: Mexico and Peru|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2512781|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=545–579|doi=10.2307/2512781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining in the Americas became formally industrialized when the process of mercury amalgamation became popularized. Mercury amalgamation was invented by a Spaniard in central Mexico in the 1550s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Historians dispute what individual was the first to invent the process, however most agree that it was a Spaniard. Mercury was the one of the highest costs of production for the Americas, since much of it had to be shipped.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ratio of Mercury to silver produced was about two to one.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, German miners introduced the [[stamp mill]] and [[lead smelting]] in the 1530s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Gunpowder was often used to blast of large holes to create the mine shafts, although there were not many deep shafts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Potosí had the most amount of ore, however it was lower quality than that of Mexico.

Mining production in the Americas largely depended on native labor in both Mexico and Peru.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Mexico, many of the natives worked as wage laborers by the middle of the 17th Century.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48249030|title=Mexico : from the beginning to the Spanish Conquest|last=1946-|first=Knight, Alan,|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052181474X|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=48249030}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the labor system known as the [[repartimiento]] still existed in some places.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Silver production in Mexico was relatively cheap when compared to that of Peru, and the general trend of Mexican labor systems was that towards waged labor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Peru mines, the [[Mit'a|mit'a system]] was a dominant form of native labor subjection, although waged laborers worked on the mines as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Natives under the mit'a system were paid much less, and this was necessary for the production of silver to continue in Peru where costs were relatively high.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Global Flow of Silver ==
The ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078977|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A popular route was around the Cape of Good Hope into the east, and sometimes it came over land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1996|title=Silk for Silver: Manila-Macao Trade in the 17th Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42634185|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=44|issue=1|pages=52–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Manilla served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, and China.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, there is a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are not many records of the amount of silver which crossed the Pacific due to it being discouraged by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], so estimates highly vary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Silver also found its way across other parts of the world as well. India and Europe both received a fair amount of silver.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This silver was often locally traded for other commodities, such as gold or crops. In India, silver flowed from the south to the north, and gold flowed the opposite way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Often silver and gold were manufactured into jewelry or hoarded as treasure.

=== China and the Demand for Silver ===
China was the ultimate destination in which silver would flow towards. In exchange, the Chinese traded their popular goods such as [[silk]] and [[porcelain]]. China had a high demand for silver due to its shift from paper money to coins in the early period of the Ming Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China's Seventeenth-Century Monetary Crisis|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123972|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=56|issue=2|pages=429–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming paper currency eventually failed due to self-imposed inflation along with an inability to stop the production of counterfeit bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shikuan|date=|title=The Sung and Ming Paper Monies: Currency Competition and Currency Bubbles|url=|journal=National Taiwan University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming attempted to produce copper coins as a new form of currency, but production was inconsistent.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Hence silver became of high value because it was a valid currency that could be processed abroad. The bimetallic ratio of silver to gold was about two to one, which meant that European and Japanese merchants made a large amount of profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell|first=William S.|date=2005|title=Another Look at Silver Imports into China, ca. 1635-1644|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20079347|journal=Journal of World History|volume=16|issue=4|pages=467–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1640s, the bimetallic ratios in China converged with the rest of the world, before experiencing another population boom.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The new population boom was a product of the introduction of New World crops into China, mainly sweet potatoes, which could be more easily grown.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; By this time, the silver mines in Japan were largely depleted and the New World became China's primary source for silver.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Initially, Japan served as China's primary source for silver in the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In exchange for silver, China would provide Japan with silk and gold.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Japan and China did not directly trade with each other, due to political tensions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This meant that European entities and countries, such as the Dutch and Portuguese served as a middle man between the two countries.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== China's Silver Dominance ===
In the famed ''[[The Wealth of Nations]],'' [[Adam Smith]] noted the sheer force and great reach of the global silver trade. He was impressed by its market value but more intrigued with the way this single item of commerce brought together new and old worlds i.e. the Americas and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53006965|title=The wealth of nations|last=1723-1790.|first=Smith, Adam,|date=2003|publisher=Bantam Classic|others=Cannan, Edwin, 1861-1935.|isbn=0553585975|edition=Bantam classic|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=53006965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade, Japan's huge contribution of silver exports to China were critical to the world economy and China's liquidity and success with the commodity. Historians posit Europeans would have been left out of world trade, and China may have fallen prey to conquest by settlers of the Americas if not for Japanese silver mining. Silver was paramount to East Asia's introduction into the global trade market.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis Owen|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] empires, China hoarded silver to boost its economy and increase its trading power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia in the Early Modern Era Trade, Power, and Belief.|last=Reid|first=Anthony J.S.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians argue that silver was responsible for the birth of global economics and trade. According to this view, global trade commenced in 1571 when [[Manila]] was founded and became the first trading post linking America and Asia due to the expansive and profitable silver trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995-01-01|title=Arbitrage, China, and World Trade in the Early Modern Period|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568520952600308|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=38|issue=4|pages=429–448|doi=10.1163/1568520952600308|issn=0022-4995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, research shows the amount of silver traveling from Manila to China was approximately three million [[peso]]s or 94,000 kilograms in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell, wen-t'i|first=William S., Ch'ing-shih|date=December 1977|title=Notes on Silver, Foreign Trade, and the Late Ming Economy|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/398568|journal=3|volume=|pages=1–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarity of silver production was seen as an opportunity for China to control the currency's value and support its own national currency. Silver was one of the only accepted trade items from Europeans and its value in China was astronomical compared to rest of the world. In fact, its value was twice that of [[Spain]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"/&gt; Between 1600 and 1800 China received 100 tons of silver on average per year. A large populace near the [[Yangtze River Delta|Lower Yangzte]] averaged a hundreds of [[tael]]s of silver per household in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Huang|first=Ray|title=Financial management|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511735400.011|work=Taxation and Governmental Finance in Sixteenth-Century Ming China|pages=266–305|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511735400|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver even played a large role when defending [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s attemptive take over of Ming ruled [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]]. The Ming Ministiry of War sent approximately 140,000 liang of silver to its soldiers and required provinces to provide silver as tax for the war effort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/843883049|title=A dragon's head and a serpent's tail : Ming China and the first great East Asian war, 1592-1598|last=Kenneth.|first=Swope,|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806185026|location=Norman|oclc=843883049}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixteenth century, the [[Daimyō|daimyos]] of Southwest Japan hoped for unhinged global trade but were stopped due to Ming China trade policies. Still, Japan became a player in the global economy via frequent Ming merchant ships arriving to extract Japan's abundance of silver and exchange goods. Japan increased its wealth through successful trilateral trade with [[Portugal]] and China as Japan now had Chinese goods to offer the Portuguese who had silver mines of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobata|first=A.|date=1965|title=The Production and Uses of Gold and Silver in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Japan|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2592093|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=245|doi=10.2307/2592093|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founder of the Ming China dynasty, [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu,]] actually sought to eliminate silver from the market due to his fear of inflation which he previously experienced in the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasty. His attempt involved imposing harsh limits on silver mining to stop its flow into the market and subsequently replaced it with baochao or paper money. However, the currency never popularized and silver proved its mainstay as a global currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|last2=Brook|first2=Timothy|date=1999|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2672136|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=72|issue=2|pages=267|doi=10.2307/2672136|issn=0030-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opium Wars==
{{Main|Opium Wars}}
Despite some restrictions, silver continued to drive trade through its popularity in Europe. This, combined with a high British demand for [[Chinese tea]], created chronic trade deficits for European governments, which were forced to risk silver deficits to supply merchants in Asia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Immobile Empire—The first great collision of East and West—the astonishing history of Britain's grand, ill-fated expedition to open China to Western Trade, 1792–94|last=Peyrefitte|first=Alain|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As supplies of silver decreased in Europe, Europeans had less ability to purchase highly coveted Chinese goods. Merchants were no longer able to sustain the China trade through profits made by selling Chinese goods in the West and were forced to take bullion out of circulation in Europe to buy goods in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebellions and Revolutions: China from the 1800s to 2000|last=Gray|first=Jack|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, American merchants began to introduce opium to Chinese markets. The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable that Chinese opium dealers began to seek out more suppliers of the drug, thus inaugurating the opium trade; one merchant declared that Opium "is like gold. It can sell any time."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 1804 to 1820, a period when the Qing Dynasty needed to finance the suppression of the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], Chinese merchants were soon exporting silver to pay for opium rather than Europeans paying for Chinese goods with the precious metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Voyage of the 'Frolic': New England Merchants and the Opium Trade|last=Layton|first=Thomas N.|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing imperial court debated whether and how to end the opium trade, eventually settling on regulations on consumption. That measure, however, resulted in an increase in drug smuggling by Europeans and Chinese traders. In 1810, the Daoguang Emperor issued an edict concerning the matter, declaring, "Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and morality. Its use is prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Documentary Chronicle of Sino-Western relations|last=Fu|first=Lo-shu|publisher=|year=1966|isbn=|volume=1|location=|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a debate at court in 1836 on whether to legalize the drug or crack down on its use, the emperor decided on the latter. An upright official, Commissioner Lin Zexu led the campaign against opium as a kind of "drug czar." The British, offended by the seizure of their property in opium, sent a large naval expedition to China to end the restrictive conditions under which they had long traded with that country. Thus began the first Opium War, in which Britain's industrialized military might was proven in China's rout. The [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ended the war in 1842 largely on British terms, imposed numerous restrictions on Chinese sovereignty and opened five ports to European traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Taking of Hong Kong: Charles and Clara Elliot in China Waters|last=Hoe|first=Susanna|last2=Roebuck|first2=Derek|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global studies''' is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[political]], [[economic]], [[legal]], [[ecological]] and [[cultural]] interconnectedness. Predominant subjects are [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[law]] on an international level. Global studies is oriented around the study of [[globalization]] as it relates to intercontinental politics, the global economy, international law, market relations, the movement of people and resources, global communications, the effect of human activity on the environment, and many more topics. Global studies is often used to map global change and is both [[Microeconomics|micro]] and [[Macroeconomics|macro]] in scope. The Cambridge English Dictionary defines global studies as ''"the study of political, economic, and social situations in the world"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge English Dictionary: Global Studies|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/global-studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global studies tackles the aforementioned topics by examining global power structures influenced by perspectives such as [[Orientalism]] and [[Eurocentrism]]. Global studies is distinguished from international studies by its broader focus – [[international studies]] is only one aspect of global studies. In cases such as international studies or [[international relations]], the concept of 'national' confines the meaning of those fields of study. By comparison, global studies has a broader reach, from the global to the local.

== History and context ==
{{See also|Globalization}}
The development of global studies in secondary and tertiary education is arguably a product of globalization, and its consequent results on the international community. In the late 20th century, an unprecedented rise in communications technologies and computerization occurred around the world, again enhancing the processes of globalization: “it is a shift in our very life circumstances ... the speed of change is closely allied to the growth of communication, and development in information and communication technologies have been exponential ... globalization is a fact of life from which we cannot retreat.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The consequences of modernity|last=Giddens|first=Anthony|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this constantly changing global community, education providers began to see a need for the introduction of global studies into secondary school curricula (i.e. introduction of  [[global issues]]  through already existing subjects), and to create global studies degrees for tertiary students (i.e. sole degrees with a global focus).

According to Jan Nederveen Pieterse, Mellichamp Professor of Global Studies and Sociology at The University of California, Santa Barbara:&lt;blockquote&gt;The first Global Studies conference took place at the University of Illinois Chicago in 2008; the 2009 conference was held in Dubai on the theme Views from Dubai: The Gulf and Globalization. The 2010 conference was in Busan, South Korea under the heading Global Rebalancing: East Asia and Globalization; the 2011 conference took place in Rio de Janeiro on Emerging societies and Emancipation; the 2012 conference was at Moscow University on the theme of Eurasia and  Globalization: Complexity  and Global studies; and the 2013 conference took place in New Delhi on the theme of Social Development in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onglobalization.com/assets/downloads/global/E14FinalProgram.pdf|title=Seventh Global Studies Conference Program|last=|first=|date=|website=onglobalization.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Global Studies Journal was founded in 2008 and is "devoted to mapping and interpreting new trends and patterns in globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onglobalization.com/journal|title=Journal – Global Studies Research Network|website=onglobalization.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of global studies ==

=== Global vs. international studies ===
There can be much confusion about the use of the terms, "global studies" and "international studies."

They are at times used interchangeably and differences in meaning are not evident, however, both disciplines are concerned with political, social and cultural issues, with the main focus of study being placed on international community interaction. However, subtle distinctions can be made between the two phrases. International studies generally looks at exchanges between states, multilateral or bilateral agreements, diplomacy and how issues are handled between two or more states. Global studies, in contrast, focuses on globally shared issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalstudies.unc.edu/masters/|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that there are [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] connotations to each phrase, international studies being preferred by the right wing (i.e. relations between states) and global studies preferred by the left (i.e. issues affecting all global citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Andrew|title=Liberal Theories of International Relations: A Primer|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/publications.html|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms have also been described as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;International studies might be called the grandfather of global education. It often includes the study of countries, world religions, languages and international relations ... (global studies) is centred on the concept of connectedness – recognizing local/ global connections, the commonalities all humans share, and how understanding how national borders have become practically irrelevant for many global actors.&lt;ref&gt;Merryfield, M 2004 ‘The importance of a global education,’ ''Outreach World'', viewed 5/10/10 at: http://www.outreachworld.org/article.asp?articleid=77 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207103229/http://outreachworld.org/article.asp?articleid=77 |date=2011-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
Five defining characteristics of global studies were identified by scholars at the first annual meeting of the [[Global Studies Consortium]] in Tokyo in 2008:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXhfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR14&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=%22Global+Studies+Consortium%22+Conference+2008+Tokyo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kAnRbWAD4e&amp;sig=3h2899QfrUezZ9coblAqlLLTUfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-5Izjj_HKAhVF7yYKHchxBpcQ6AEISDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Global%20Studies%20Consortium%22%20Conference%202008%20Tokyo&amp;f=false ''Thinking Globally: A Global Studies Reader'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikt:transnational|Transnational]]
* [[Interdisciplinary]]: global studies scholarship can involve politics, economics, history, geography, anthropology, sociology, religion, technology, philosophy, health as well as the study of the environment, gender, and race.
* [[Contemporary]] and [[historical]] examples range from the transnational activity of the Greek and Roman Empires to modern European colonialism.
* [[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial]] and [[Critical theory|Critical]]: global studies often emphasizes a postcolonial perspective, and attempts to analyze global phenomena through a critical, multicultural lens.

== Subjects of interest ==
The field of global studies revolves around the impacts of globalization and the growing interdependence of states, economies, societies, cultures, and people. This necessitates that students are well versed and capable of critical analysis when it comes to global issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Education Policies and Practices," Peace Corps. {{cite web |url=http://peacecorpsconnect.org/global-education-policies-and-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612210639/http://peacecorpsconnect.org/global-education-policies-and-practices |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}, accessed September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the most pressing issues in global studies are [[national security]] and [[diplomacy]], effective [[citizenship]] in a [[participatory democracy]], global [[competitiveness]] in a world market and the desire to enter the aid and development sector.

=== National security ===
The first major funding for international education was the 1966 International Education Act in the US.  It provided funding to institutions of higher education to create and strengthen international studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Digest for Education Statistics, 2004 – Chapter 4: Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities." National Center for Education Statistics (2004), http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/ch_4.asp, accessed September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Created at the time of the [[Cold War]], this act stressed the need for all citizens (with a focus on USA citizens) to understand global issues in order to build skills for diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;International Education Act: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, United States Senate, Eighty-Ninth Congress, Second Session on S. 2874 and H.R. 14643. Publication date: 1966, Accessed through ERIC, http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED093756&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED093756.&lt;/ref&gt;”The importance of diplomacy as a driving force for political development is well known and understood. It is of great importance as a long term instrument for conflict prevention.”&lt;ref&gt;Skylakakis, T 2010, ‘The importance of economic diplomacy,’ The Bridge Magazine, viewed 24/9/10 at:  http://www.bridgemag.com/magazine/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=81&amp;Itemid=38&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of issues and crisis on a global scale such as international terrorism, climate change and environmental degradation, pandemics (such as ebola), and the [[Great Recession]] have convinced policymakers of the importance of global studies and international education to national security and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korry, Elaine. "Bush Expected to Hike Funding for Language Training," National Public Radio Broadcast, January 5, 2006, Accessed online https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127944&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global economy ===

A second motivation for global studies is facilitating a better understanding of the [[global marketplace]].  Many international companies have identified the need for a workforce that has the skills to work cross-culturally and identify and serve the needs of a global market.&lt;ref&gt;Groennings, Sven. "Economic Competitiveness and International Knowledge.  A Regional Project on the Global Economy and Higher Education in New England.  Staff Paper II."  New England Board of Higher Education. October 28, 1987. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Some international companies, such as Microsoft, have taken the lead in convening policymakers and key stakeholders to demand additional investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;"ECS, ISTE and [[Microsoft]] to Sponsor Global Education Competitiveness Summit." http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/jun09/06-23gecs2009nrpr.mspx, Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The US state and federal governments have also placed global studies as a key priority for preparing a competitive workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Putting the World into World Class Education.  West Virginia Department of Education. http://wvconnections.k12.wv.us/documents/GlobalAwarenessPresentation062408_001.ppt, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2002 the Australian federal government (through its development body AusAID) used some of its funding to introduce a ‘Global Education Program.’ This program aims to increase understanding of development and international issues among Australian students. It provides teachers with professional development opportunities with NGOs and thorough curriculum support. The program “informs and encourages teachers to introduce students to global issues in a classroom setting.”&lt;ref&gt;Gallus, C 2002 ‘Global Studies Statement Launch,” AusAID, viewed 2/10/10 at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Speech&amp;ID=9768_9422_1276_9667_8426 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923153626/http://ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Speech&amp;ID=9768_9422_1276_9667_8426 |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education institutions have closely followed with integrating international studies across disciplines.  It is rare to find a leading business school without an international focus.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School. http://www.hbs.edu/global/, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Business School. http://mba.yale.edu/MBA/curriculum/core/international.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925054608/http://mba.yale.edu/MBA/curriculum/core/international.shtml |date=2009-09-25 }}, Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global citizenship and rights ===
A third motivation for global studies is the creation of an effective citizenry.  In the US, the National Council of Social Studies states that the purpose of social studies is to “teach students the content knowledge, intellectual skills, and civic values necessary for fulfilling the duties of citizenship in a participatory democracy.”  A key goal of the NCSS is “global education”.&lt;ref&gt;"About National Council for the Social Studies." The National Council for Social Studies, http://www.socialstudies.org/about, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  As globalization causes the lines between national and international to become blurred, it becomes increasingly important for citizens to understand global relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Lapayese, Yvette. "Review:Toward a Critical Global Studies Education" Comparative Education Review, Vol. 47, No. 4 (Nov., 2003), pp. 493–501&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of effective [[Global citizenship]] results in people who are willing to, and have the capacity to become involved in local and global issues. In the UK, local government research conducted in the surrounding areas of London has found that citizens must have the opportunity to become involved and then possess the skill, knowledge and confidence to take part. The outcomes are often very positive, leading to an improvement in services, better quality of democratic participation and community education.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Cowell, Downe, Martin 2006 ‘Promoting effective citizenship and community empowerment,’ Office of the Deputy PM, London, viewed at: {{cite web |url=http://www.cdhn.org/documentbank/uploads/PromotingEffectiveCitizenship.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725151250/http://www.cdhn.org/documentbank/uploads/PromotingEffectiveCitizenship.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;    
To achieve effective citizenship, students must be educated in ways that engage and place emphasis on the importance of global issues. By studying a subject such as global studies, students can gain the knowledge required to become effective citizens.

Some critical scholars note that beyond content, students must be taught "global cognition" in order to truly understand global perspectives.  These scholars believe that in order to fully understand world issues, students must recognize that their perspective is not necessarily shared by others and understand the social forces that influence their views.&lt;ref&gt;Hanvey, Robert. "An Attainable Global Perspective." Theory into Practice, Vol. 21, No. 3, Global Education (Summer, 1982), pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Charlotte. "Global Education in the Classroom." Theory into Practice, Vol. 21, No. 3, Global Education (Summer, 1982), pp. 168–76&lt;/ref&gt; These perspectives encourage engagement with new promises and threats for the promotion of human rights, social justice, and political participation.

=== International Institutions ===
By 2006, the international development sector had expanded exponentially, with the “NGO sector now being the 8th largest economy in the world ... employing nearly 19 million paid workers."&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Jones, P 2006, ‘The rise and rise of NGOs,’ Public Services International, viewed 23/9/10 at: http://www.world-psi.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11738&amp;TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122306/http://www.world-psi.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11738&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm |date=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financing health projects used to be the biggest issue in global aid, but private and public organizations like the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] have helped overcome such problems. The issue now is making sure that the money is used in a proper manner to help those in need of the primary essentials of life.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Laurie. 2007. "The Challenge of Global Health," ''Foreign Affairs'' '''86''' (1):14-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying global studies may lead to involvement in the aid and [[International development|development]] sector in multiple ways. These can include working in post-conflict or natural disaster zones, improving public services in developing communities (health, education, infrastructure, agriculture) or aiding private sector growth through business and market models.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey International Development, 2010 ‘Work that makes a difference,’ Coffey, viewed 24/9/10 at: http://www.coffey.com/our-businesses/coffey-international-development/our-expertise/sectors/overview{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studying global studies, students can be equipped with cross cultural knowledge, field experience and an awareness of global issues. Many students are now studying global studies in order to enter this sector.

== Learning outcomes and job prospects ==
Learning outcomes for global studies vary depending on the institutes curriculum and students individual focuses. Although, introductory courses are designed to cover a wide range of topics in a single semester, students are expected to delve into a specific phenomenon or area of study for their academic career.   there are some generic outcomes that students are expected to develop over the duration of study. These include, but are not limited to:
*Cultural awareness
*Ability to analyze the interconnectedness of the global and local
*Skills in ethical research and analysis with specific policy implications
*Awareness of current affairs
*Ability to communicate effectively in a range of situations
*Increase in cross cultural competence
*potentially improve proficiency in a foreign language

Global studies scholars are eligible for a myriad of professions, tackling political, social, and economic issues on an international scale that work to improve the human condition.
*International relations
*Foreign affairs
*NGOs
*Local, national, and international government 
*Environmental research
*Historical Analysis

*March 2009 FISC ruling showing a consistent pattern of misrepresentations of the bulk telephone metadata collection program by the government to the Court. It also held that the data was being routinely queried in ways that did not meet "reasonable articulatable suspicion", demonstrating inadequate safeguards in the software and training of analysts. Showing that "thousands of violations resulted from the use of identifiers that were not "RAS-approved by analysts who were not even aware that they were accessing BR metadata," and that in 2006 "there was no single person [in the NSA] who had a complete understanding of the BR FISA system architecture," a situation which persisted until February 2009 or later. RAS is shorthand for Reasonable Articulatable Suspicion. The Court nonetheless reapproved the collection of bulk phone metadata, while mandating additional safeguards and training, and "end-to-end system engineering reviews," and reports from the review.

In his opinion, he wrote, "a bulk telephony metadata collection program [is] a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data" and noted that a similar collection of data prior to 9/11 might have prevented the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bazzle |first=Steph |title=Judge Says NSA's Data Collection Is Legal |url=http://www.indyposted.com/227717/judge-says-nsas-data-collection-legal/ |publisher=Indyposted |accessdate=28 December 2013 |date=27 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228162843/http://www.indyposted.com/227717/judge-says-nsas-data-collection-legal/ |archivedate=December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. And further he ruled that, when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is [[Smith v. Maryland]]: "Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties," Judge Pauley wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Upholds N.S.A.'s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html?ref=us&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 2013|author1=Adam Liptak |author2=Michael S.

*Numerous reports relating to drones, including "Threats to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", a report summarizing attempts to shoot down, intercept, control or otherwise spoof drones. While the report details vulnerabilities of specific aircraft, the document itself has not been published, but only excerpts described. Other reports detail American spin efforts, suggesting that the phrases "drone strike," "kill list," "robot warfare," "Aerial Assassins" be avoided, offering "lethal UAV operations" instead, and also terms like "Pre-emptive and Preventive Military Action" and "Inherent Right of Self Defense."

*[[Tempora]] – Collects data from transatlantic fibre-optic cables of major telecommunications corporations by directly tapping on them and from Internet backbones. Tempora uses intercepts on the fibre-optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet to gain access to swaths of internet users' personal data. The intercepts are placed in the United Kingdom and overseas, with the knowledge of companies owning either the cables or landing stations.

== Suggested protective measures from surveillance ==

=== Encryption ===
In [[cryptography]], [[encryption]] is the process of encoding information in such a way that eavesdroppers or hackers cannot read it, but that authorized parties can. According to Snowden's recommendations published by ''The Guardian Edward'' in September 2013,&lt;ref name="Encryp" /&gt; properly implemented strong [[Cryptosystem|crypto systems]] were among the few things which one can rely on. However, [[Communication endpoint|endpoint]] security is often too weak to prevent the [[NSA]] from finding ways around it.&lt;ref name="Encryp"&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA surveillance: A guide to staying secure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underground bunkers ===
In September 2013, it was reported by the press that a number of countries deemed by the US and its allies to be [[rogue state]]s, such as [[Syria]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], had successfully evaded U.S. government surveillance by constructing secret bunkers deep below the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Narayan Lakshman|title=Secret bunkers, a challenge for U.S. intelligence|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/secret-bunkers-a-challenge-for-us-intelligence/article5164833.ece?ref=relatedNews|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2013|location=Chennai, India|date=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]]'s underground megaproject, the [[816 Nuclear Military Plant]] in [[Chongqing]] (now declassified and opened to tourists), was reported to be "most worrying" for the U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14785">The '''ITF Rankings''' are the current rankings of national teams by the [[International Tennis Federation]] in both men's and women's [[tennis]]. The ITF produces two sets of rankings—the ITF [[Davis Cup]] Nations Ranking for male national teams, and the ITF [[Fed Cup]] Nations Ranking for female national teams. Both sets of rankings measure the success of all nations participating in both competitions.

The ITF Davis Cup Nations Ranking was launched at the end of 2001 and the ITF Fed Cup Nations Ranking was introduced a year later. Both rankings are updated following every World Group round and are used for [[seed (sports)|seeding]] the highest ranked teams in the draws for each group in the competitions' structures.

==Ranking method==

The ITF [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] rankings are based in a rolling four year cumulative system. However, the points total for each nation is calculated following a weighted sum formula, in which recent results are weighted more heavily.&lt;ref name="ITFDavisCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=daviscup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=Rankings Explained| url = http://www.daviscup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=fedcup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=How the Rankings Work| url = http://www.fedcup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each World Group round, the ranking period adjusts, and points earned in the last year period have a weighting factor of 100% in the points total. At the same time, the weighting factor for the points earned until the same round in the previous three years is reduced to 75% (for points earned one to two years ago), 50% (for points earned two to three years ago) and 25% (for points earned three to four years ago).

Ranking points are awarded only to the winning nation of a competition tie at every round. Victories in World Group rounds are worth more points than those in Zone Groups, and ties at the later rounds of the competition are progressively worth more points. Bonus points are also awarded for a nation that defeats a higher-ranked nation, but only if the latter nation is ranked in the top 64 for the Davis Cup, or in the top 75 for the Fed Cup. Unique to the Davis Cup, there is an additional bonus for a nation that wins a tie in the opponent's home ground: a 25% bonus is added to the total of round points and ranking bonus points (if any). At the Fed Cup only, nations that win by walkover are awarded round points but no bonus points, and no points are awarded for consolation events.

===Men===

The current ranking points and bonus points distribution tables for the [[Davis Cup]] are shown below:

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In the Groups I, II and III a nation's points are determined by its overall finishing position. Formats vary according to the numbers of nations playing each year so the value of each win alters too. However the maximum points a nation can win at each level remains constant.&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25198">An '''intergovernmental organization''' or '''international governmental organisation''' ('''IGO''') is an [[organization]] composed primarily of [[sovereign state]]s (referred to as ''[[member state]]s''), or of other intergovernmental organizations. Intergovernmental organizations are  called [[international organization]]s, although that term may also include [[international non-governmental organization]] such as international [[nonprofit organization]]s or [[multinational corporation]]s.
 
Intergovernmental organizations are an important aspect of [[public international law]]. IGOs are established by a treaty that acts as a [[charter]] creating the group. Treaties are formed when lawful representatives (governments) of several states go through a [[ratification]] process, providing the IGO with an international [[legal personality]].

Intergovernmental organizations in a legal sense should be distinguished from simple groupings or coalitions of states, such as the [[G8]] or the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]]. Such groups or associations have not been founded by a constituent document and exist only as [[task force|task group]]s.

Intergovernmental organizations must also be distinguished from treaties. Many treaties (such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], or the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] before the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]]) do not establish an organization and instead rely purely on the parties for their administration becoming legally recognized as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' commission. Other treaties{{which|date=March 2016}} have established an administrative apparatus which was not deemed to have been granted international legal personality.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Types and purpose==
Intergovernmental organizations differ in function, membership, and membership criteria. They have various goals and scopes, often outlined in the treaty or [[charter]]. Some IGOs developed to fulfill a need for a neutral forum for debate or negotiation to resolve disputes. Others developed to carry out mutual interests with unified aims to preserve peace through [[conflict resolution]] and better [[international relations]], promote international cooperation on matters such as [[List of supranational environmental agencies|environmental protection]], to promote [[human rights]], to promote [[Social change|social development]] (education, [[health care]]), to render [[humanitarian aid]], and to [[economic development]]. Some are more general in scope (the United Nations) while others may have subject-specific missions (such as Interpol or the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and other [[standards organization]]s). Common types include:

* Worldwide or global organizations - generally open to nations worldwide as long as certain criteria are met. This category includes the [[United Nations]] (UN) and its specialized agencies, the [[Universal Postal Union]], [[Interpol]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), the [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO), and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). It also includes globally operating intergovernmental organisations that are not an agency of the UN, including for example the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], a globally operating intergovernmental organisation based in [[The Hague]] that pursues the progressive unification of [[Conflict of laws|private international law]].
* Cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical organizations - open to members based on some cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical link. Examples include the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Arab League]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], [[Turkic Council]], [[International Organization of Turkic Culture]],  [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).
* Economic organizations - based on economic organization. Some are dedicated to [[free trade]] and the reduction of trade barrier, e.g. [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. Others are focused on [[International Development Research Centre|international development]]. International [[cartel]]s, such as [[OPEC]], also exist. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) was founded as an economics-focused organization. An example of a recently formed economic IGO is the [[Bank of the South]].
* Educational organizations - centered around tertiary level study. [[Academy of European Law]] offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. [[EUCLID (university)]] chartered as a university and umbrella organization dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries and [[United Nations University]] efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are the concern of the United Nations, its Peoples and Member States.
* Health and Population Organizations- based on the common perceived health and population goals and to address those challenges collectively. An example is the intergovernmental partnership for population and development [http://www.partners-popdev.org/ Partners in Population and Development].
* [[Regional organization]]s - open to members from a particular continent region or other specific region of the world. This category includes the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CLACS), [[Council of Europe]] (CoE), [[European Union]] (EU), [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EAEU), [[Energy Community]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[African Union]] (AU), [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), Islamic Development Bank, [[Union of South American Nations]], [[Asia Cooperation Dialogue]] (ACD), [[Pacific Islands Forum]], and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS)
[[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD).

In 1993 the network was formalized under its present name, but remained a project of IDRC. Work to launch INBAR as an independent organization started in 1995, and was completed in 1997 when INBAR became an independent organization with its headquarters in Beijing, China – the first intergovernmental organization to be headquartered in the People's Republic.
Membership and structure

Membership

42 member countries make up this organisation.

==History==
While treaties, [[Political alliance|alliances]], and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] conferences had existed for centuries, IGOs only began to be established in the 19th century. Among the first were the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], initiated in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the International Telegraph Union (the future [[International Telecommunication Union]]), which was founded by the signing of the International Telegraph Convention by 20 countries in May 1865. Of notable significance was the emergence of the [[League of Nations]] following World War One, designed as an institution to foster collective security in order to sustain peace.

==Expansion and growth==
Held and McGrew (2002) counted thousands of IGOs worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Held and McGrew, 2002: Introduction, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt; and this number continues to rise. This increase may be attributed to globalization, which increases and encourages the cooperation among and within states. Globalization has also provided easier means for IGO growth, as a result of increased international relations. This is seen economically, politically, militarily, as well as on the domestic level. Economically, IGOs gain material and non-material resources for economic prosperity. IGOs also provide more political stability within the state and among differing states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which type of international organizations can settle civil wars?|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=12|issue=4|pages=613–641|doi=10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military alliances are also formed by establishing common standards in order to ensure security of the members to ward off outside threats. Lastly, the formation has encouraged autocratic states to develop into democracies in order to form an effective and internal government.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Megan. "The Expansion of International Organizations" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Hilton Chicago and the Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, IL, Sep 02, 2004 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-05-26 [http://www.allacademic.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125043303/http://www.allacademic.com/ |date=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation and involvement==
There are several different reasons a state may choose membership in an intergovernmental organization. But there are also reasons membership may be rejected. These reasons are explored in the sections below.

Reasons for participation:
# Economic rewards: In the case of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), many different countries receive economic benefits from membership in the free trade agreement. For example, Mexican companies are given better access to [[United States|U.S.]] markets due to their membership.
# Political influence: Smaller countries, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Belgium]], who do not carry much political clout on the international stage, are given a substantial increase in influence through membership in IGOs, such as the [[European Union]]. Also for countries with more influence such as [[France]] and [[Germany]] they are beneficial as the nation increases influence in the smaller countries' internal affairs and expanding other nations dependence on themselves, so to preserve allegiance 
# Security: Membership in an IGO such as [[NATO]] gives security benefits to member countries. This provides an arena where political differences can be resolved.
# Improve democracy and the likelihood of democratic survival: It has been noted that member countries experience a greater degree of democracy and those democracies survive longer.
 
Reasons for rejecting membership:
# Loss of [[sovereignty]]: Membership often comes with a loss of state sovereignty as treaties are signed which require cooperation on the part of all member states.
# Insufficient benefits: Often membership does not bring about substantial enough benefits to warrant membership in the organization.

==Privileges and immunities==
Intergovernmental organizations are provided with privileges and immunities that are intended to ensure their independent and effective functioning. They are specified in the treaties that give rise to the organization (such as the [[Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations]] and the [[Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court]]), which are normally supplemented by further multinational agreements and national regulations (for example the [[International Organizations Immunities Act]] in the United States). The organizations are thereby immune from the jurisdiction of national courts.

Rather than by national jurisdiction, legal [[accountability]] is intended to be ensured by legal mechanisms that are internal to the intergovernmental organization itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parish | first = Matthew | title = An essay on the accountability of international organizations | journal = International Organizations Law Review | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–342 | doi= 10.1163/157237410X543332 | ssrn = 1651784 | date = 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and access to administrative tribunals.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}
These are some of the strengths and weaknesses of IGOs:

Strengths:
# They hold state authority.
# Their institutions are permanent.
# They provide a forum for discussion.
# They are issue specific.
# They provide information.
# They allow multilateral cooperation.

Weaknesses:
# Membership is limited. Prohibits the membership of private citizens. This makes IGOs undemocratic. In addition, not all IGOs allow universal membership.
# IGOs often overlap resulting in a complex network.
# States have to give up part of their sovereignty, which weakens the state's ability to assert its authority.
# Inequality among state members creates biases and can lead powerful states to misuse these organizations.

They can be deemed unfair as countries with a higher percentage voting power have the right to veto any decision that is not in their favor, leaving the smaller countries powerless.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40567">'''International broadcasting''' is [[broadcasting]] that is deliberately aimed at a foreign, rather than a domestic, audience. It usually is broadcast by means of [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]], or (more usually) [[shortwave]] radio, but in recent years has also used direct [[satellite]] broadcasting and the [[internet]] as means of reaching audiences.

Although radio and television programs do travel outside national borders, in many cases reception by foreigners is accidental. However, for purposes of [[propaganda]], transmitting religious beliefs, keeping in touch with colonies or expatriates, education, improving trade, increasing national prestige, or promoting tourism and goodwill, broadcasting services have operated '''external services''' since the 1920s.

== History ==
International broadcasting, in a limited extent, began during [[World War I]], when German and British stations broadcast press communiqués using [[Morse code]]. With the severing of Germany's undersea cables, the wireless telegraph station in [[Nauen]] was the country's sole means of long-distance communication.

The US Navy Radio Service radio station in New Brunswick, Canada, transmitted the '[[Fourteen Points]]' by wireless to Nauen in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 56&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Nauen station broadcast the news of the abdication of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] on November 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office. ''International Law Documents: Neutrality, Conduct and Conclusion of Hostilities''. 1919, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi 1901 wireless signal.jpg|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] carried out the first short wave transmissions over a long distance.]]
[[Guglielmo Marconi]] pioneered the use of [[short wave]] radio for long distance transmissions in the early 1920s. Using a system of parabolic reflector antennae, Marconi's assistant, [[Charles Samuel Franklin]], rigged up a large antenna at [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], running on 25&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht ''Elettra'' in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC|title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet|author=John Bray|year=2002|publisher=IET|pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; High speed shortwave telegraphy circuits were then installed from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]] from 1926.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

The Dutch began conducting experiments in the shortwave frequencies in 1925 from [[Eindhoven]]. The radio station [[PCJJ]] began the first international broadcasting on March 11, 1927 with programmes in Dutch for colonies in the [[Dutch West Indies]] and [[Dutch East Indies]] and in German, Spanish and English for the rest of the world. The popular [[Happy Station]] show was inaugurated in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bureauafrique.nl/autresdepartements/africa/Radionetherlandsturns60/aboutrnw_history ''History of Radio Netherlands''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228214010/http://www.bureauafrique.nl/autresdepartements/africa/Radionetherlandsturns60/aboutrnw_history |date=2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Marconi also turned his attention toward long distance broadcasting on shortwave. His first such broadcasts took place to commemorate [[Armistice Day]] in the same year. He continued running a regular international broadcast that was picked up around the world, with programming from the [[2LO]] station, then run by the [[BBC]]. The success of this operation caught the BBC's attention, and rented out a shortwave transmitting station in [[Chelmsford]], with the callsign G5SW, to Marconi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/Wavescan/wavescan090920.html|title=Daventry Calling - 2: Station G5SW Chelmsford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC Empire Service]] was finally inaugurated on December 19, 1932, with transmissions aimed towards Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;BBC World Service. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/timeline.shtml ''World Service timeline''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
Other notable early international broadcasters included [[Vatican Radio]] (February 12, 1931), [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]], the official service of the Soviet Union (this has since been renamed the [[Voice of Russia]], following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Clarence W. Jones started transmitting on Christmas Day, 1931 from Christian missionary radio station [[HCJB]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. Broadcasting in South Asia was launched in 1925 in [[Ceylon]] - [[Radio Ceylon]], now the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] is the oldest in the region.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17049, Joseph Goebbels spricht.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Joseph Goebbels]] headed [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]]. International broadcasting was an important element in [[Nazi propaganda]].]]
Shortwave broadcasting from [[Nauen]] in Germany to the USA, Central and South America, and the Far East began in 1926. A second station, [[Zeesen short-wave transmitter (1931)|Zeesen]], was added in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 49&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1932, the German [[Reichspost]] assumed control of the Nauen station and added to its shortwave and longwave capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000:57&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed power in 1933, shortwave, under the ''Auslandsrundfunk'' (Foreign Radio Section), was regarded as a vital element of [[Nazi propaganda]].

German shortwave hours were increased from two hours a day to 18 per day, and eventually twelve languages were broadcast on a 24-hour basis, including English. A 100 [[kilowatt]] transmitter and antenna complex was built at [[Zeesen]], near Berlin. Specialty target programming to the United States began in 1933, to South Africa, South America, and East Asia in 1934, and South Asia and Central America in 1938. German propaganda was organized under [[Joseph Goebbels]], and played a key role in the [[German annexation of Austria]] and the [[Munich Crisis]] of 1938.

In 1936, the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Radio Union]] recognized Vatican Radio as a "special case" and authorized its broadcasting without any geographical limits. On December 25, 1937, a Telefunken 25-kW transmitter and two directional antennas were added. Vatican Radio broadcast over 10 frequencies.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"&gt;Levillain 2002: 1600&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nationalist forces received a powerful [[Telefunken]] transmitter as a gift of Nazi Germany to aid their propaganda efforts, and until 1943 [[Radio Nacional de España]] collaborated with the Axis powers to retransmit in Spanish news from the official radio stations of Germany and Italy.

=== World War II ===
During the [[Second World War]], Russian, German, British, and Italian international broadcasting services expanded. In 1942, the United States initiated its international broadcasting service, the [[Voice of America]]. In the Pacific theater, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] used shortwave radio to keep in touch with the citizens of the Japanese-occupied Philippine Islands.

Several announcers who became well known in their countries included [[British Union of Fascists]] member [[William Joyce]], who was one of the two "[[Lord Haw-Haw]]"s; Frenchmen [[Paul Ferdonnet]] and [[André Olbrecht]], called "the traitors of [Radio] Stuttgart"; and Americans [[Frederick William Kaltenbach]], "Lord Hee-Haw", and [[Mildred Gillars]], one of the two announcers called "[[Axis Sally]]". Listeners to German programs often tuned in for curiosity's sake—at one time, German radio had half a million listeners in the U.S.--but most of them soon lost interest. Japan had "Tokyo Rose", who broadcast Japanese propaganda in English, along with American music to help ensure listeners.

During World War II, Vatican Radio's news broadcasts were banned in Germany. During the war, the radio service operated in four languages.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"/&gt;

The British launched [[Radio SEAC]] from Colombo, [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) during World War II. The station broadcast radio programs to the allied armed forces across the region from their headquarters in Ceylon.

Following the war and German partition, each Germany developed its own international broadcasting station: [[Deutsche Welle]], using studios in [[Cologne]], West Germany, and [[Radio Berlin International]] (RBI) in East Germany. RBI's broadcasts ceased shortly before the reunification of Germany on October 3, 1990, and Deutsche Welle took over its transmitters and frequencies.

=== Cold War Era ===
The Cold War led to increased international broadcasting (and [[radio jamming|jamming]]), as Communist and non-Communist states attempted to influence each other's domestic population. Some of the most prominent Western broadcasters were the [[Voice of America]], the [[BBC World Service]], and the (covertly) CIA-backed [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The Soviet Union's most prominent service was [[Radio Moscow]] (now the Voice of Russia) and China used [[Radio Peking]] (then [[Radio Beijing]], now [[China Radio International]]). In addition to the U.S.-Soviet cold war, the Chinese-Russian border dispute led to an increase of the numbers of transmitters aimed at the two nations, and the development of new techniques such as playing tapes backwards for reel-to-reel recorders.

West Germany resumed regular shortwave broadcasts using Deutsche Welle on May 3, 1953. Its Julich transmitter site began operation in 1956, with eleven 100-kW Telefunken transmitters. The Wertachtal site was authorized in 1972 and began with four 500-kW transmitters. By 1989, there were 15 transmitters, four of which relayed the Voice of America.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 51&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in East Germany, the Nauen site began transmitting Radio DDR, later Radio Berlin International, on October 15, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 58&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Antenna system used Radio-Liberty 02.jpg|thumb|400px|Diagrams showing coverage of the [[Radio Liberty]] transmission site at [[Playa de Pals|Playa de Pals, Spain]] {{FFDC|Antenna system used Radio-Liberty 02.jpg|9 May 26|date=March 2012}}]] --&gt;
In addition to these states, international broadcast services grew in Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Under the presidency of [[Gamal Nasser]], [[Egypt]]ian transmitters covered the Arab world; Israel's service, [[Kol Yisrael]], served both to present the Israeli point of view to the world and to serve the [[Jewish diaspora]], particularly behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

[[Radio RSA]], as part of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, was established in 1966 to promote the image of South Africa internationally and reduce criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz 2001: 287&lt;/ref&gt; It continued in 1992, when the post-apartheid government renamed it [[Channel Africa]].

Ironically, the isolationist [[Albania]] under [[Enver Hoxha]], virtually a [[hermit kingdom]], became one of the most prolific international broadcasters during the latter decades of the Cold War, with [[Radio Tirana]] one of the top five broadcasters in terms of hours of programming produced.

=== Today ===
At the end of the [[Cold War]], many international broadcasters cut back on hours and foreign languages broadcast, or reemphasized other language services. For example, in 1984, Radio Canada International broadcast in English, French, German, Spanish, Czech/Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. In 2005, RCI broadcast in English, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and Spanish. There is a bigger trend towards TV (e.g. BBC World News, NHK World, CCTV-9) and news websites. Some services, such as Swiss Radio International, left shortwave altogether and exist in Internet form. In addition, new standards, such as [[Digital Radio Mondiale]], are being introduced, as well as sending programs over the Web to be played back later, as "[[podcast]]s".

International broadcasting using the traditional audio-only method will not cease any time soon due to its cost efficiencies. However, international broadcasting via television is considered more strategically important at least since the early 2000s.

The [[BBC World Service]] was the first broadcaster to consider setting up a satellite television news and information channel as far back as 1976, but ceded being the first to [[CNN]] (that had primary access to [[Canada]] soon after launch). The defunct BBC World Service [[Antigua]] Relay Station was built in 1976, but its setup costs were not known to have been part of the BBCWS decision processes at the time.

In the early 1990s, many international (as well as domestic) 24-hour news and information channels launched as part of the post-[[Cold War]] prosperity bubble. There was another burst of global news channels launching in the late 2000s as part the developing world trying to catch up with the developed world in this area.

== Reasons for international broadcasting ==
Broadcasters in one country have several reasons to reach out to an audience in other countries. The examples given below are not meant to be exhaustive, but are illustrative.

One clear reason is for ideological, or [[propaganda]] reasons. Many government-owned stations portray their nation in a positive, non-threatening way. This could be to encourage business investment and/or tourism to the nation. Another reason is to combat a negative image produced by other nations or internal dissidents, or insurgents. [[Radio RSA]], the broadcasting arm of the apartheid South African government, is an example of this. A third reason is to promote the ideology of the broadcaster. For example, a program on [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] from the 1960s to the 1980s was ''What is Communism?''

A second reason is to advance a nation's foreign policy interests and agenda by disseminating its views on international affairs or on the events in particular parts of the world. During the [[Cold War]] the American [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]] and Indian Radio [[All India Radio|AIR]] were founded to broadcast news from "behind the Iron Curtain" that was otherwise being censored and promote dissent and occasionally, to disseminate [[disinformation]]. Currently the US operates similar services aimed at [[Cuba]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].

The [[BBC World Service]], the [[Voice of America]], [[All India Radio]] and other western broadcasters have emphasized news broadcasts, particularly to countries that are experiencing repression or civil unrest and whose populations are unable to obtain news from non-government sources. In the case of emergencies, a nation may broadcast special programs overseas to inform listeners what is occurring. During Iraqi missile strikes on Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, [[Kol Israel]] relayed its domestic service on its shortwave service.

Besides ideological reasons, many stations are run by religious broadcasters and are used to provide religious education, religious music, or worship service programs. For example, [[Vatican Radio]], established in 1931, broadcasts such programs. Another station, such as [[HCJB]] or [[Trans World Radio]] will carry brokered programming from evangelists. In the case of the [[Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], both governmental and religious programming is provided.

Stations also broadcast to international audiences for cultural reasons. Often a station has an official mandate to keep expatriates in touch with the home country. Many broadcasters often relay their national domestic service on shortwave for that reason. Other reasons include teaching a foreign language, such as [[Radio Exterior de España]]'s Spanish class, ''Un idioma sin fronteras'', or the Voice of America's broadcasts in [[Special English]]. In the case of major broadcasters such as the [[BBC World Service]] or [[Radio Australia]], there is also an educational outreach.

An additional reason for international broadcasting is to maintain contact with a country's citizens travelling abroad or expatriates who have emigrated and share news from home as well as cultural programming. This role of external shortwave broadcasting has declined as advances in communications have allowed expatriates to read news from home and listen and watch to domestic broadcasts in their own language via the internet and satellite. A number of international services such as the original [[BBC Empire Service]], [[Radio Netherlands]], France's Poste Colonial (now [[Radio France International]]) and others were founded in part with the goal of helping draw overseas empires closer to the [[mother country]] and provide closer cultural and communication connections between the home country and its colonies, a role that became largely obsolete due to [[decolonization]].

== Means to reach an audience ==
Because of this many broadcasters are discovering they can reach a wider audience through other methods (particularly the internet and satellite television) and are cutting back on (or even entirely dropping) shortwave.

An international broadcaster has several options for reaching a foreign audience:
* If the foreign audience is near the broadcaster, high-power longwave and mediumwave stations can provide reliable coverage.
* If the foreign audience is more than 1,000 kilometers away from the broadcaster, shortwave radio is reliable, but subject to interruption by adverse solar/geomagnetic conditions.
* An international broadcaster may use a local mediumwave or FM radio or television relay station in the target country or countries.
* An international broadcaster may use a local shortwave broadcaster as a relay station.
* Neighboring states, such as [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]], may broadcast television programs to each other's viewing public.

An international broadcaster such as the BBC, Radio France International or Germany's Deutsche Welle, may use all the above methods. Several international broadcasters, such as [[Swiss Radio International]], have abandoned shortwave broadcasting altogether, relying on Internet transmissions only. Others, such as the BBC World Service, have abandoned shortwave transmissions to North America, relying on local relays, the Internet, and satellite transmissions

=== Mediumwave and longwave broadcasts ===
Most radio receivers in the world receive the [[mediumwave]] band (530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1710&amp;nbsp;kHz), which at night is capable of reliable reception from 150 to 2,500&amp;nbsp;km distance from a transmitter. Mediumwave is used heavily all over the world for international broadcasting on a formal and informal basis.

In addition, many receivers used in Europe and Russia can receive the [[longwave]] broadcast band (150 to 280&amp;nbsp;kHz), which provides reliable long-distance communications over continental distances.

=== Shortwave broadcast ===
[[Shortwave receiver]]s are capable of receiving [[shortwave]] transmissions (2,000 to 30,000&amp;nbsp;kHz or 2 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz). Depending on time of day, season of year, solar weather and Earth's geomagnetic field, a signal might reach around the world.

[[Image:RCI-BC-ANZ431-dbu.png|thumb|300px|This sort of map is used by radio engineers to determine the best frequencies to reach international audiences on shortwave bands. In this case, a transmitter is sited in the Southern [[Vancouver Island]], using a frequency of 12095 kHz and transmitting at the 500 kW power level. The picture shows a good signal over the Southern Pacific. The signal fades out as it approaches the [[Eastern states of Australia|East Coast of Australia]].]]

In previous decades shortwave (and sometimes high-powered mediumwave) transmission was regarded as the main (and often the ''only'') way in which broadcasters could reach an international audience. In recent years the proliferation of technologies such as satellite broadcasting, the Internet, and rebroadcasts of programming on AM and FM within target nations has meant that this is no longer necessarily the case.

Transmitter output power has increased since 1920. Higher transmitter powers do guarantee better reception in the target area. Higher transmitter power in most cases counteracts the lesser effects of [[radio jamming|jamming]].
* 1950s : 100&amp;nbsp;kW
* 1960s : 200&amp;nbsp;kW, early 1960s (2 x 100&amp;nbsp;kW 'twinned')
* 1970s : 300&amp;nbsp;kW, but many 250&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters sold
* 1980s : 500&amp;nbsp;kW sometimes transmitters were "doubled up" to produce 1000&amp;nbsp;kW output
* 1980s-present: 600&amp;nbsp;kW single, 1200&amp;nbsp;kW from twinned transmitters.

International stations generally use special [[HRS type antennas|directional antennas]] to aim the signal toward the intended audience and increase the [[Effective radiated power|effective power]] in that direction. Use of such antennas for international broadcasting began in the mid-1930s and became prominent by the 1950s. By using antennas which focus most of their energy in one direction, a modern station may achieve the equivalent, in that direction, of tens of millions of [[watt]]s of radio power.

=== Digital Audio Broadcasting ===
Some international broadcasters have become available via [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) in Europe in the 1990s, and in a similar limited way in the Americas via in-band FM ([[IBOC]]) DAB systems in the US in the 2000s. This is a popular method to reach listeners in cars that would otherwise not be accessible during that part of the day. However, in terms of the global international broadcasting audience the DAB listener base is very small—one can assume that it is less than 2% of the listener base globally.

=== Television ===
International broadcasting via 24 hour TV news channels has its origins in North America in the early 1980s. CNN technically was the first 24-hour international news channel as it was made available in Canada soon after launch. The BBC World Service considered setting up a global TV news channel as far back as 1975, but abandoned the idea for internal reasons.

Notwithstanding a large number of international 24-hour television news and information broadcasters, the television percentage of viewers is still fairly small when compared to global radio listener numbers.

The rural populations of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (as well as East Asia) have radio listener bases that are far larger than the largest international TV broadcaster could hope for, yet they could be considered underserved since the end of the Cold War (when these regions had more radio broadcasts targeted at them).

==== Streaming video sites ====
Many international television broadcasters (as well as domestic television broadcasters) have set up accounts on streaming video sites like [[YouTube]] to allow their news and information broadcasts to be globally distributed. The viewer numbers for these sites may seem huge. Cable, TVRO and terrestrial television broadcasters probably have 100 to 1,000 times larger audiences for their international broadcasting content.

International broadcasters known to maintain their own streaming video sites (not authoritative):

* [[Al Jazeera English]]
* [[BBC World News]]
* [[CNN International]]
* [[DD News]]
* [[Deutsche Welle|DW]]
* [[France 24]]
* [[i24NEWS]]
* [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly known as “Russia Today”)
* [[Sky News]]
* [[WION (TV channel)|WION]] (World is One News)

=== RSS feeds and email ===
Many international broadcasters (television or radio) can reach "unreachable" audiences via email and RSS feeds. This is not at all unusual, as the first commonly agreed international broadcast was a Morse Code telegram transmitted from US President Wilson to the German Kaiser (mid-1918) via a high powered longwave transmitter on the US East Coast (this important event in international broadcasting history was described in depth in the IEEE "The History of International Broadcasting" first volume). As Morse Code is considered to be a data format, with email and RSS merely being refinements of the technology it can be said that international broadcasting has a deep relationship with modern-day datacasting.

The reach of RSS and email for international broadcasters is not really known that well, especially considering that emails get forwarded. The numbers for active RSS and email audiences are probably 5 to 20 times larger than for streaming video. It may take into the 2010s to get meaningful numbers with respect to the size of these audiences for assorted technical reasons related to the RSS and email technologies.

Email and RSS feeds can traverse telecommunications barriers that streaming video cannot, thus the larger expected audience numbers. The global economic downturn of 2008-2009 will probably increase the email and RSS audience sizes as fewer people will be able to afford high speed internet connections in North America, Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions.

== Listeners ==
An international broadcaster may have the technical means of reaching a foreign audience, but unless the foreign audience has a reason to listen, the effectiveness of the broadcaster is in question.

One of the most common foreign audiences consists of expatriates, who cannot listen to radio or watch television programs from home. Another common audience is [[Shortwave listening|radio hobbyists]], who attempt to listen to as many countries as possible and obtain verification cards or letters (''QSLs''). These audiences send letters and in response few radio stations write them back. These kind of Listeners often take part in weekly and monthly quizzes and contests started by many radio stations. A third audience consists of journalists, government officials, and key businesspersons, who exert a disproportionate influence on a state's foreign or economic policy.

A fourth, but less publicized audience, consists of intelligence officers and agents who monitor broadcasts for both [[open-source intelligence]] clues to the broadcasting state's policies and for hidden messages to foreign agents operating in the receiving country. The BBC started its monitoring service in Caversham, Reading in 1936 (now [[BBC Monitoring]]). In the United States, the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|DNI]] [[Open Source Center]] (formerly the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]]) provides the same service. Copies of OSC/FBIS reports can be found in many U.S. libraries that serve as government depositories. In addition, a number of hobbyists listen and report "spook" transmissions.

Without these four audiences, international broadcasters face difficulty in getting funding. In 2001, for example, the BBC World Service stopped transmitting shortwave broadcasts to North America, and other international broadcasters, such as YLE Radio Finland, stopped certain foreign-language programs.

However, international broadcasting has been successful when a country does not provide programming wanted by a wide segment of the population. In the 1960s, when there was no BBC service playing rock and roll, Radio Television Luxembourg ([[RTL Group|RTL]]) broadcast rock and roll, including bands such as [[the Beatles]], into the United Kingdom. Similar programming came from an unlicensed, or "pirate" station, [[Radio Caroline]], which broadcast from a ship in the international waters of the North Sea.

== Restricting reception ==
In many cases, governments do not want their citizens listening to international broadcasters. In Nazi Germany, a major propaganda campaign, backed by law and prison sentences, attempted to discourage Germans from listening to such stations. The practice was made illegal in 1939.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Mann 2002: 93"&gt;Hughes and Mann 2002: 93&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the German government sold a cheap, 76-[[Reichsmark]] [[Volksempfänger|"People's Receiver"]], as well as an even cheaper 35-Reichsmark receiver,&lt;ref name="Hughes and Mann 2002: 93"/&gt; that could not pick up distant signals well.&lt;ref name="Graef 2005: 36"&gt;Graef 2005: 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was copied by Stalin's Soviet Union, which had a nearly identical copy manufactured in the Tesla factory in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="Graef 2005: 36"/&gt;
In North Korea, all receivers are sold with fixed frequencies, tuned to local stations.

The most common method of preventing reception is [[radio jamming|jamming]], or broadcasting a signal on the same frequencies as the international broadcaster. Germany jammed the BBC European service during the Second World War. Russian and Eastern European jammers were aimed against [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], other Western broadcasters, and against Chinese broadcasters during the nadir of Sino-Soviet relations. In 2002, the Cuban government jammed the [[Voice of America]]'s [[Radio y Televisión Martí|Radio Martí]] program and the Chinese government jammed [[Radio Free Asia]], [[Voice of America]], [[Radio Taiwan International]] as well broadcasts made by adherents of [[Falun Gong]].

North Korea restricts most people to a single fixed frequency mediumwave receiver; those who met political requirements and whose work absolutely required familiarity with events abroad were allowed shortwave receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin 2006: 495&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of reaching people with government radio programming, but not foreign programming, is the use of radio broadcasting by direct broadcasting to loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;Goetz, Philip W. ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1991 edition, {{ISBN|0-85229-400-X}}, p 315&lt;/ref&gt;
David Jackson, director of the Voice of America, noted "The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David. "The Future of Radio II". ''World Radio TV Handbook'', 2007 edition. 2007, Billboard Books. {{ISBN|0-8230-5997-9}}. p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another method of preventing reception involves moving a domestic station to the frequency used by the international broadcaster. During the Batista government of Cuba, and during the Castro years, Cuban medium-wave stations broadcast on the frequencies of popular South Florida stations. In October 2002, Iraq changed frequencies of two stations to block the Voice of America's [[Radio Sawa]] program.

Jamming can be defeated by using very efficient transmitting antennas, carefully choosing the transmitted frequency, changing transmitted frequency often, using [[Single-sideband modulation|single sideband]], and properly aiming the receiving antenna.

In [[computing]], '''internationalization and localization''' are means of adapting [[computer software]] to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target locale.&lt;ref name="SFW"&gt;{{cite book|title=Software Without Frontiers: A multi-platform, multi-cultural, multi-nation approach|isbn=9780471969747|editors=Patrick A.V. Hall, Martyn A. Ould|others=With contributions and leadership by Ray Hudson, Costas Spyropoulos, Timo Honkela et al.|publisher=Wiley|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding [[Locale (computer software)|locale]]-specific components. Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once, or as an integral part of ongoing development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bert Esselink|url=http://isg.urv.es/library/papers/Esselink_Evolution.pdf|title=The Evolution of Localization|series=Guide to Localization|publisher=Multilingual Computing and Technology|year=2003|quote=In a nutshell, localization revolves around combining language and technology to produce a product that can cross cultural and language barriers.

== Naming ==

The terms are frequently abbreviated to the [[numeronym]]s '''''i18n''''' (where ''18'' stands for the number of letters between the first ''i'' and the last ''n'' in the word ''internationalization'', a usage coined at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in the 1970s or 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/2001/12/Glossary#I18N | title=Glossary of W3C Jargon | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] | accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.i18nguy.com/origini18n.html | title=Origin of the Abbreviation I18n }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''L10n'' for ''localization'', due to the length of the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n | title=Localization vs. Internationalization| publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies, like [[IBM]] and [[Sun Microsystems]], use the term "globalization", ''g11n'', for the combination of internationalization and localization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/|title=IBM  Globalization|date=17 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as "[[glocalization]]" (a [[portmanteau]] of ''globalization'' and ''localization'').

[[Microsoft]] defines internationalization as a combination of world-readiness and localization. World-readiness is a developer task, which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures (globalization) and separating user interface resources in a localizable format (localizability, abbreviated to ''L12y'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688110.aspx|title=Software Internationalization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688112.aspx|title=Software Internationalization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[HP-UX]] created a system called "National Language Support" or "Native Language Support" (NLS) to produce localizable software.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Globalisationchart.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The internationalization and localization process&lt;br&gt;(based on a chart from the [[Localization Industry Standards Association|LISA]] website)]]

According to ''Software without frontiers'', the design aspects to consider when internationalizing a product are "data encoding, data and documentation, software construction, hardware device support, user interaction"; while the key design areas to consider when making a fully internationalized product from scratch are "user interaction, algorithm design and data formats, software services, documentation".&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

Translation is typically the most time-consuming component of [[language localization]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; This may involve:
* For film, video, and audio, translation of spoken words or music lyrics, often using either [[Dub localization|dubbing]] or [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]
* Text translation for printed materials, digital media (possibly including error messages and documentation)
* Potentially altering images and logos containing text to contain translations or generic icons&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Different translation length and differences in character sizes (e.g. between [[Latin alphabet]] letters and [[Chinese characters]]) can cause layouts that work well in one language to work poorly in others&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Consideration of differences in [[dialect]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* Writing conventions like:
** Formatting of numbers (especially [[decimal separator]] and [[digit grouping]])
** [[Date and time representation by country|Date and time format]], possibly including use of different calendars

[[Computer software]] can encounter differences above and beyond straightforward translation of words and phrases, because computer programs can generate content dynamically.  These differences may need to be taken into account by the internationalization process in preparation for translation. Many of these differences are so regular that a conversion between languages can be easily automated. The [[Common Locale Data Repository]] by [[Unicode]] provides a collection of such differences. Its data is used by major [[operating system]]s, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Debian]], and by major Internet companies or projects such as [[Google]] and the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Examples of such differences include:
* Different "scripts" in different [[writing systems]] use different [[Character (symbol)|characters]] - a different set of letters, syllograms, logograms, or symbols.  Modern systems use the [[Unicode]] standard to represent many different languages with a single [[character encoding]].
* [[Writing direction]] is left to right in most European languages, right-to-left in Hebrew and Arabic, or both in [[boustrophedon]] scripts, and optionally vertical in some Asian languages.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; 
* [[Complex text layout]], for languages where characters change shape depending on context
* Capitalization exists in some scripts and not in others
* Different languages and writing systems have different [[Collation|text sorting]] rules
* Different languages have different [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral systems]], which might need to be supported if [[Western Arabic numerals]] are not used
* Different languages have different pluralization rules, which can complicate programs that dynamically display numerical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/gettext/Plural-forms.html|title=GNU gettext utilities: Plural forms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other grammar rules might also vary, e.g. [[genitive]].
* Different languages use different punctuation (e.g. quoting text using double-quotes (" ") as in English, or [[guillemet]]s (« ») as in French)
* [[Keyboard shortcut]]s can only make use of buttons actually on the [[keyboard layout]] which is being localized for.  If a shortcut corresponds to a word in a particular language (e.g. Ctrl-s stands for "save" in English), it may need to be changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/do-we-need-to-localize-keyboard-shortcuts/ languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403113353/http://languagetranslationsservices.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/do-we-need-to-localize-keyboard-shortcuts/ |date=April 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National conventions ===

Different  countries have different economic conventions, including variations in:
* [[Paper size]]s
* [[Broadcast television systems]] and popular [[storage media]]
* [[National conventions for writing telephone numbers|Telephone number formats]]
* [[Address (geography)#Mailing address format by country|Postal address formats]], [[postal code]]s, and choice of delivery services
* [[Currency]] ([[Currency symbol|symbols]], positions of currency markers, and reasonable amounts due to different [[inflation]] histories) - [[ISO 4217]] codes are often used for internationalization
* [[System of measurement]]
* [[Battery sizes]]
* [[Mains electricity by country|Voltage and current standards]]
In particular, the United States and Europe differ in most of these cases. Other areas often follow one of these.

Specific third-party services, such as online maps, weather reports, or [[payment service provider]]s, might not be available worldwide from the same carriers, or at all.

[[Time zone]]s vary across the world, and this must be taken into account if a product originally only interacted with people in a single time zone.  For internationalization, [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is often used internally and then converted into a local time zone for display purposes.

Different countries have different legal requirements, meaning for example:
* [[Compliance (regulation)|Regulatory compliance]] may require customization for a particular jurisdiction, or a change to the product as a whole, such as:
** [[Privacy law]] compliance
** Additional [[disclaimer]]s on a web site or packaging
** Different consumer labelling requirements
** Compliance with [[export restrictions]] and regulations on [[encryption]]
** Compliance with an [[Internet censorship]] regime or [[subpoena]] procedures
** Requirements for [[accessibility]]
** Collecting different taxes, such as [[sales tax]], [[value added tax]], or [[customs duties]]
** Sensitivity to different political issues, like [[:Category:Geographical naming disputes|geographical naming disputes]] and [[Border dispute|disputed borders]] shown on maps (e.g., India has proposed a controversial bill that would make failing to show [[Kashmir]] and other areas as intended by the government a crime&lt;ref name="HaiderPakistan16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1258908/pakistan-expresses-concern-over-indias-controversial-maps-bill |title=Pakistan expresses concern over India's controversial 'maps bill' |author=Haider, M. |work=Dawn |publisher=Pakistan Herald Publication (Pvt.)

*Government-assigned numbers have different formats (such as passports, [[Social Security Number]]s and other [[national identification number]]s)

Localization also may take into account differences in culture, such as:
* [[List of holidays by country|Local holidays]] 
* [[Personal name]] and [[title]] conventions
* [[Aesthetics]]
* Comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness of images and [[color symbolism]]
* [[Ethnicity]], clothing, and [[socioeconomic status]] of people and architecture of locations pictured
* Local customs and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], such as social taboos, popular local religions, or superstitions such as [[blood types in Japanese culture]] vs. astrological signs in other cultures

==Business process for internationalizing software==
In order to ''internationalize'' a product, it is important to look at a variety of markets that the product will foreseeably enter.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

Details such as field length for street addresses, unique format for the address, ability to make the postal code field optional to address countries that do not have postal codes or the state field for countries that do not have states, plus the introduction of new registration flows that adhere to local laws are just some of the examples that make internationalization a complex project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccjk.com/what-is-internationalization-i18n-localization-l10n-and-globalization-g11n/ Internationalizing a Product: What is Internationalization (i18n), Localization (L10n) and Globalization (g11n)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114350/http://www.ccjk.com/what-is-internationalization-i18n-localization-l10n-and-globalization-g11n/ |date=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Address Formats|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc195167.aspx|work=Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader approach takes into account cultural factors regarding for example the adaptation of the business process logic or the inclusion of individual cultural (behavioral) aspects.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowski, J.M. (2008): Culture Profiles: Facilitating Global Learning and Knowledge Sharing. Proc.
of ICCE 2008, Taiwan, Nov. 2008.  [http://users.jyu.fi/~japawlow/culture_profiles_pawlowski_draft20080901.pdf Draft Version]&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 1990s, companies such as [[Groupe Bull|Bull]] used [[machine translation]] ([[Systran]]) in large scale, for all their translation activity: human translators handled pre-editing (making the input machine-readable) and [[post-editing]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

==Engineering==

Both in re-engineering an existing software or designing a new internationalized software, the first step of internationalization is to split each potentially locale-dependent part (whether code, text or data) into a separate module.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;&lt;!-- § 4.3.1 --&gt; Each module can then either rely on a standard library/dependency or be independently replaced as needed for each locale.

The current prevailing practice is for applications to place text in resource strings which are loaded during program execution as needed.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; These strings, stored in resource files, are relatively easy to translate. Programs are often built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data.

The storage for translatable and translated strings is sometimes called a message catalog&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; as the strings are called messages. The catalog generally comprises a set of files in a specific localization format and a standard library to handle said format. One [[software library]] and format that aids this is [[gettext]].

Thus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime. The code required to manage data entry verification and many other locale-sensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements. Modern development systems and operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of these types, see also [[#Standard locale data|Standard locale data]] above.

Many localization issues (e.g. writing direction, text sorting) require more profound changes in the software than text translation. For example, [[OpenOffice.org]] achieves this with compilation switches.

==Process==

A globalization method includes, after planning, three implementation steps: internationalization, localization and quality assurance.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt;

To some degree (e.g. for [[quality assurance]]), development teams include someone who handles the basic/central stages of the process which then enable all the others.&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; Such persons typically understand foreign languages and cultures and have some technical background. Specialized technical writers are required to construct a culturally appropriate syntax for potentially complicated concepts, coupled with engineering resources to deploy and test the localization elements.

Once properly internationalized, software can rely on more decentralized models for localization: [[free and open source software]] usually rely on self-localization by end-users and volunteers, sometimes organized in teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_11|title=A Preliminary Analysis of Localization in Free Software: How Translations Are Performed|last=Reina|first=Laura Arjona|last2=Robles|first2=Gregorio|last3=González-Barahona|first3=Jesús M.|date=2013-06-25|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642389276|editor-last=Petrinja|editor-first=Etiel|series=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|pages=153–167|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_11|editor-last2=Succi|editor-first2=Giancarlo|editor-last3=Ioini|editor-first3=Nabil El|editor-last4=Sillitti|editor-first4=Alberto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[KDE3]] project, for example, has been translated into over 100 languages;&lt;ref&gt;For the current list see [http://l10n.kde.org/teams-list.php KDE.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MediaWiki]] in 270 languages, of which 100 mostly complete {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Group_statistics|title=Translating:Group statistics - translatewiki.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When translating existing text to other languages, it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of texts throughout the life of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/feature/58406/sponsored-feature-how-to-translate-a-game-into-20-languages-and-avoid-going-to-hell/|title=How to translate a game into 20 languages and avoid going to hell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a message displayed to the user is modified, all of the translated versions must be changed.

==Commercial considerations==

In a commercial setting, the benefit from localization is access to more markets. In the early 1980s, [[Lotus 1-2-3]] took two years to separate program code and text and lost the market lead in Europe over [[Microsoft Multiplan]].&lt;ref name="SFW"/&gt; MicroPro found that using an Austrian translator for the West German market caused its [[WordStar]] documentation to, an executive said, not "have the tone it should have had".&lt;ref name="schrage19850217"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/02/17/ibm-wins-dominance-in-european-computer-market/bdcb9e21-8107-4dad-88d7-713f2709a8d8/ |title=IBM Wins Dominance in European Computer Market |last=Schrage |first=Michael |date=1985-02-17 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-08-29 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are considerable costs involved, which go far beyond engineering. Further, business operations must adapt to manage the production, storage and distribution of multiple discrete localized products, which are often being sold in completely different currencies, regulatory environments and tax regimes.

Finally, sales, marketing and technical support must also facilitate their own operations in the new languages, in order to support customers for the localized products. Particularly for relatively small language populations, it may thus never be economically viable to offer a localized product. Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product, and a product's internal structure already permits localization, a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales.

An '''interval signal''', or '''tuning signal''', is a characteristic sound or musical phrase used in [[international broadcasting]], [[numbers stations]], and by some domestic broadcasters, played before commencement or during breaks in transmission, but most commonly between programmes in different languages. It serves several purposes:
* It assists a listener to tune his or her radio to the correct frequency of the station. This is because most older and cheaper radio receivers do not have digital frequency readout.
* It informs other stations that the frequency is in use.
* It serves as a station identifier even if the language used in the subsequent broadcast is not one the listener understands.

The practice began in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s and was carried over into [[shortwave]] broadcasts.  The use of interval signals has declined with the advent of digital tuning systems, but has not vanished. Interval signals were not required on commercial channels in the USA, where jingles were used as identification.

'''Media Network''' was the name of a weekly [[radio]] programme broadcast on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] from 7 May 1981 until 26 October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/about About Media Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430184725/http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/about |date=30 April 2010 }}, Radio Netherlands Worldwide blog&lt;/ref&gt; When the programme began the station was known as Radio Nederland, but was renamed Radio Netherlands shortly thereafter.  The programme concentrated on [[communications]] topics with particular reference to international [[shortwave]] [[broadcasting]], but also went on to cover [[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]], [[television]], [[satellite]], [[internet]], reviews of shortwave receivers and other electronic devices. It was produced and presented by Jonathan Marks. In the course of 1994, he was joined by colleague Diana Janssen, who was working as a media researcher at the station, who co-hosted the show until shortly before its end. Media Network ran for over 1000 editions.

==Early history==
[http://www.jonathanmarks.com Jonathan Marks], a British radio producer arrived in the [[Netherlands]] in August 1980. He had previously freelanced for [[Radio Austria International]] in the period 1976-1980 and briefly for the World Radio Club programme running on the [[BBC World Service]]. He was hired as the fifth host of the Radio Nederland "DX Jukebox" programme, a technical show that had been running on the English service since the 1958. His first show was broadcast on 7 August 1980. The content of "DX Jukebox" also revolved around shortwave broadcasting, giving information on schedules for various other stations as well as a variety of details on improving reception. As the name suggested, a portion of the show was devoted to [[music]].

Marks decided that the show needed to be updated to reflect a new era. Fewer listeners were building their own radios. The music was shortened and a name change was also planned for the middle of 1981, with Media Network being the name suggested by Roger Broadbent, a colleague producer. Audience reactions suggested a demand for a new style of programme to be not just about when and on what frequency one could listen to a given station on shortwave, but also about ''why'' one should listen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.omroep.nl/rnw/medianetwork/jonathanwindows500.wmv Jonathan Marks on the history of Media Network] 25th Anniversary vodcast (Copyright Critical Distance B.V.)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, a time when international [[telephony]] was still of a potentially mediocre sound quality (making it unsuitable for shortwave broadcasts), Media Network went against the established wisdom and made extensive use of the telephone. Calls were made to the show's various contributors. On many occasions where telephone quality was deemed too poor for broadcast, a [[Magnetic tape|tape recording]] was made at both ends of the line, then the person with whom Marks was speaking would post the tape to the Netherlands. The two recordings were subsequently edited together resulting in a conversation with much better sound quality.

==Show Format==
Over the years the show had many regular contributors who provided valuable information on stations that went on or off the air, [[radio propagation]] conditions, new communications technology and the development of digital formats such as DAT, CD and DVD. Listeners were also encouraged to [[telephone]] an answer line and leave their comments and questions. These messages became an integral part of the programme.

The show prided itself on being less predictable than its predecessor by reporting from international conferences, compiling thematic documentaries and organising its own research surveys into radio related publications and receivers. On some occasions, the reviews of receivers conducted by the show had an influence on the manufacturers who later contacted Media Network for advice on improving their products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.libsyn.com/media/jonathanmarks/MN.04.05.2000.insiders.mp3 Jonathan and Diana discuss the show's history]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Specials covered historic events as conveyed by the media, such as the first [[Gulf War]], the [[Falklands War]] and [[propaganda]] during [[World War II]] and in more recent conflicts. There were also many [[DXpedition]]s or media safari documentaries to profile stations in different parts of the world (e.g. South Africa, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Bonaire).

==Radio Programme Becomes Weblog==
After Diana Janssen left the show in September, 2000 to pursue another career with Forrester Research, Jonathan Marks (who was also employed as Radio Netherlands' Director of Programmes) made the decision to end the show. He cited the increasingly demanding task of fulfilling a corporate role at Radio Netherlands combined with producing a show of a "high standard that we strive for and you deserve".&lt;ref&gt;Media Network edition broadcast 21 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The four editions that followed were replays of popular specials with a finale on 26 October 2000. The editorship of the program was handed over to Andy Sennitt (a frequent contributor also working at Radio Netherlands) who continued the brand as a [[weblog]] until 24 March 2012, shortly before Sennitt retired. The Media Network blog has now been removed from the Radio Netherlands Worldwide site. A copy is available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20130117071721/http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/ archive.org]. No new material or comments will be published there. The Media News aspects of that site have been transferred to the [http://criticaldistance.blogspot.nl/ Critical Distance blog], edited by Jonathan Marks. This is a non-commercial venture.

In February, 2010, Jonathan Marks, now an independent media strategist, launched a project called the '''Media Network Vintage Vault''' which allows the general public to download studio quality editions in [[Mp3]] format. As of July 2015, over 460 editions have been [[digitizing|digitized]] and made available free of charge. Some other programmes made by Jonathan Marks have also been uploaded to the same website, such as "Marks on Mechanics" and "The Hitchhiker's Guide to [[DXing]]", a comedic spoof of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] which had shortwave radio as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonathanmarks.libsyn.com/index.php?post_category=Media%20Network%20Archives Media Network Vintage Vault] The vault for complete Media Network shows taken from the collection 1981-2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, '''Medical Service Ministries''' (since 1992) is a trust organization that provides support via grants to [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian mission]] affiliated applicants who are looking to further their specializations in courses such as [[community health]] and [[tropical medicine]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_b"&gt;''Medical service ministries.'' [http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to 1992, Medical Service Ministries was known as the Missionary School of Medicine (1903-1992) and provided homeopathic training to Christian missionaries who found that they were ill-equipped to help themselves and others in a tropical climate.&lt;ref&gt;The papers of the Medical Service Ministries including minutes, student records, student fellowship files, publications and photographs are held by [https://www.soas.ac.uk/library/archives/collections/a-z/m/ SOAS Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; MSM was formed through the collaborative efforts of the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] and the [[British Homeopathic Association]] in 1903. 
While class size was always relatively small, the 1990s showed particularly small class size. This spurred the Missionary School of Medicine to be renamed Medical Service Ministries in 1992. The implications behind the word “[[missionary]]” were thought to be driving students away.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries"&gt;Davies, A. E. (2007). The history of MSM—homeopathy and natural medicines. [http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/download/The%20History%20of%20MSM.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increasing cost of running the school coupled with the demands brought on by qualifications required by many developing countries at this time caused MSM to close the school portion of the organization (1996) in order to become strictly a [[trust fund]] for funding applicants supported by [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian communities/organizations]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;

== Background ==

During the 19th century, many [[missionary|missionaries]] sought to expand trade and spread the Christian gospel in the developing [[British colonies]]. However, many found that they were ill-equipped in the tropical climate; many missionaries and their families became ill. Due to this lack of medical knowledge, many missionaries returned to England to receive [[first aid]] training at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a"&gt;Price, P. (2003). In Cousins A. J. (Ed.), ''Touching the ends of the earth: The story of medical service ministries.'' {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/resources/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528022605/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/resources/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} United Kingdom: Medical Service Ministries.&lt;/ref&gt;
As a supporter of the newly formed [[British Homeopathic Association]], the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] was one such place that offered to train missionaries in first aid. The [[British Homeopathic Association|British Homeopathic Association’s]] Educational Committee ran these trainings in partnership with the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]]. Lectures were offered in both basic medicine and surgery.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
Finding increased interest from returning missionaries, in the autumn of 1903, the Missionary School of Medicine was opened at the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] to accommodate the training. Upon its opening, Dr. Edwin A. Neatby became the first Dean of the Missionary School of Medicine, presiding over the 24 students enrolled in the school’s first class.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;

== Mission and Work ==

=== Organization===

The Missionary School of Medicine was organized   with a President, and  a general council.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; There were additionally a treasurer and a warden, responsible for both running the school day-to-day and teaching nursing procedures,

Presidents of the school include Edwin A. Neatby (beginning in 1903), H. Dodd (beginning in 1952), and Kathleen Priestman (serving from 1981-1991).&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;

[[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] was a notable treasurer for the Missionary School of Medicine due to his contributions to the formation of the school’s [[financial endowment|endowment fund]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; Wardens that served at the school include:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
* Miss Goodwin (1903-1934)
* Miss Elizabeth Bargh (1934-1965)
* Miss Lyle Bottom (1965-1980)
* Mrs. Jean Hayward-Lynch (1980-1996)

The teaching staff included homeopathic physicians  experienced in [[tropical medicine]] and other specialties. M  Some of the teaching staff and their subjects include:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;
* Children’s diseases: Donald Foubister and Kathleen Priestman
* Skin diseases: Alva Benjamin
* General medicine: Charles Wheeler, John MacKillop, [[Queenie Muriel Francis Adams|Muriel Adams]]
* Surgery: W Eldon Tucker and P Cutner
* Dentistry: N E Gillham
* Podiatry: J N LeRossignol

=== Teaching Program&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

The teaching program was delivered over the course of three terms. Early course offerings included lectures in basic medicine and surgery, and later expanded to the other medical areas, as well as to   Homeopathic pharmacy
The goal of the curriculum was to enable missionaries to care for themselves, their families, and others when abroad and when there was no additional medical aid available.

Lectures were held at [[Wellcome Collection|The Wellcome Museum]] as well as at the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]]. The [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] also allowed students at their clinics and to study there. Further, [[St. John Ambulance|St. John’s Ambulance Association]] taught first aid at the school.

Upon graduation from the school, graduates received both homeopathic remedies and certificates. The remedies were donated by homeopathic pharmacies that were involved in teaching at the school, and were given to the graduates to take with them on their missions.

=== Finances&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

In the early 1900s, the “Scholarship Fund” was formed by Reverend Omri Jenkins. It was hoped that an endowment fund could be created from this to cover costs of running the school. The treasurer was responsible for overseeing this fund. Treasurer [[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] was particularly successful in gathering donations for the fund, attracting funds through private connections.

In addition to these funds, student fees were used to help cover the cost of running the school. Since student fees were kept low, they never could fully cover the cost of running the school. Here is a progression of the student fees at the school:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
* 1909-1926: full-time course cost six guineas per student
* 1950s: one term cost 30 guineas per student
* 1978: one term cost £50 per student
* 1979-1980: one term cost £400 per student (only 15 students enrolled)

=== Students&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

Most students were sponsored by the [[Mission (Christianity)|Missionary Societies]] that sent them abroad. MSM students were supported by 115 different Societies.

Many different countries were represented in MSM. From the 1960s to the 1970s, students came from England, Japan, Norway, Germany, and Korea. In the 1980s, students also came from Angola, the Netherlands, Indonesia, South America, Finland, India, Kenya, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Switzerland.

In the first 50 years of the school, class sizes ranged from 20-30 students. In later years, class sizes were much less, averaging to about 10 students or less per class.

=== Graduates&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

Upon graduating from the school, many graduates went abroad to serve in places including Africa, Japan, South America, India, and Iceland. Supported by home churches and [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] organizations, many graduates set up clinics in the places where they served. Often, the clinics and Mission hospitals in which MSM graduates worked formed the basic network for the development of healthcare in many countries.

=== Homeopathy and Natural Medicines&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

''Main articles: [[Homeopathy]]

[[Homeopathy]] and natural medicine were the focus of the studies of the students at MSM.

Two main principles guide the use of medicine in homeopathy: the Similia Principle and the Dose. The Similia Principle states that a substance that can cause a symptom complex in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. The Dose states that the quantity of medicine used should be the smallest possible to affect a cure and should not be repeated as long as improvement lasts. 
In addition, MSM focused on the use of natural medicine. Natural medicine seeks to combine the advantages of both [[traditional medicine|traditional]] and [[modern medicine]]. [[Traditional medicine]] refers to the use of knowledge of the use of locally grown plants coupled with an understanding of the language and culture of local villages. [[Modern medicine]] refers to the use of drugs that are regulated and produced to a high standard. Through combining these two types of medicine, natural medicine seeks to develop a new culturally appropriate and cost effective health service.

=== MSM Moves&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

In 1925, the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] found that it needed the study room it lent to MSM as a place for it to train its own nurses. As a result, the school moved from [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] to 2 Powis Place, where it remained until it closed in 1996.

=== Aims of the School&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

In 1936, [[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] (treasurer), stated the aims of the Missionary School of Medicine:
# To enable missionaries to look after their own health.
# To enable missionaries to nurse and treat one another on the mission field when ill or miles away from medical aid.
# To enable missionaries to start dispensaries for the local people and so open the door for the gospel tidings.

=== A New Name for MSM&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

While class size was always relatively small, the 1990s showed particularly small class size. Leaders in the school assumed that lack of interest could be attributed to the implications of the word “[[missionary]]” in modern day culture. As a result, the Missionary School of Medicine was renamed Medical Service Ministries in 1992. One goal of the renaming was to attract more students to take their 10-week summer courses. However, as class size did not show a significant improvement, the school closed in 1996.

== Closing of the School and Conversion to a Trust ==

=== From School to Trust&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

The 1990s showed a major development in the health ministries of emerging nations, like Africa. As a result, these developing nations requested that those offering medical treatment have required registered qualifications. In order to provide academically recognized qualifications, Medical Service Ministries found that it would have to merge with a university. However, since class sizes were so small and the cost to run the school was only increasing, Medical Service Ministries decided to discontinue training in 1996.

When the school closed, investment income was transferred to the Scholarship Fund, reducing administration costs. As a result, with the work of the Administrator of Trust, Mrs. Glennis Powling, Medical Service Ministries was able to make its financial resources available to fund applicants traveling elsewhere.

=== MSM Today&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

As a grant-making trust, Medical Service Ministries provides grants to candidates undertaking specialist training in these areas:
* Child health
* [[Community health]]care
* Disaster relief
* [[Midwifery]]
* [[Palliative care]]
* Travel and [[tropical medicine]]

In addition, MSM generally considers funding applicants who are primary healthcare trainers or workers in impoverished areas of underdeveloped countries. Further, applicants must show evidence of sponsorship or support of a [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian mission]] or local community.

One example of a [[trust fund]] applicant success story can be found in Tamara Filmer, a [[missionary]] working in rural, undeveloped Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Filmer, T. "Training to forecast!" {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/02/training-to-forecast/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528025417/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/02/training-to-forecast/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Filmer writes:

''“With MSM’s assistance I was able to attend training in logistics and management regarding pharmaceuticals.  In December 2012, I travelled from the mid-west of Nepal to India’s capital, Delhi, to attend a two-week course entitled “International Procurement and Supply Chain Management”.  I walked away with a suitcase of information and resources! ... I want to thank Medical Service Ministries and their supporters for the funding that enabled me to attend this course.  On our missionary living allowance, it just wouldn’t have been possible to afford the course, so I am grateful for this opportunity.”''

=== Mission Statement&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

The current mission statement of Medical Service Ministries is as follows:

''“To encourage full-time Christian workers in the UK and elsewhere to prepare for Personal and Community Healthcare work in the developing world, in association with Christian organizations, and to witness to their faith in obedience to Christ’s command to preach and heal. Funding is available for approved healthcare candidates.”''

Recently retired treasurer, Brian Weller, shows that this mission statement is alive in the everyday actions of MSM and its leadership when he states:&lt;ref&gt;Weller, B. "MSM's third treasurer in 107 years stands down." {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/05/msms-third-treasurer-in-107-years-stands-down/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528022746/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/05/msms-third-treasurer-in-107-years-stands-down/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
''“It is my belief that overseas Christian service in response to Our Lord’s commission to preach and heal calls for continued effort and support, and will not lack His supply as we rise to the challenge.  Our vision is to make healthcare accessible and to raise standards.  It will continue to be achieved through individuals called by God to play their part here at home and overseas.”''

It is associated with several positions, such as [[right-wing populism]],&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stokes|first1=Bruce|title=Analysis: Europe's far-right anger is moving mainstream|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-europe-far-right-movement-20161219-story.html|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=Chicago Tribune|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]],&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; [[protectionism]],&lt;ref name="opendemocracy"/&gt; [[opposition to immigration]]&lt;ref name="ecr"/&gt;, [[Islamophobia|opposition to Islam and Muslims]]&lt;ref name="Bangstad 2018 pp. 285–311"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bangstad | first=Sindre | title=Diversity and Contestations over Nationalism in Europe and Canada | chapter=The New Nationalism and its Relationship to Islam | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK | publication-place=London | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-137-58986-6 | doi=10.1057/978-1-137-58987-3_11 | pages=285–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Euroscepticism]] where applicable. According to one scholar, "nationalist resistance to global liberalism turned out to be the most influential force in Western politics" in 2016.&lt;ref name="Movesian"/&gt; Particularly notable expressions of new nationalism include the [[United Kingdom]] [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|European Union membership referendum]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as the 45th [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="economist new nationalism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persaud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rushkoff"/&gt;

==Overview and characteristics==
Writing for ''[[Politico]]'', Michael Hirsh described new nationalism as "a bitter [[Populism|populist]] rejection of the status quo that global elites have imposed on the international system since the [[Cold War]] ended, and which lower-income voters have decided—understandably—is unfair."&lt;ref name="Hirsh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote in ''[[The Week]]'' that new nationalism is a "broad [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] revolt" against post-Cold War politics long "characterized by an orthodoxy of [[free trade]], nurturing the [[service economy]], [[neoliberal]] trading arrangements, and liberalized immigration policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dougherty|first1=Michael Brendan|title=A new nationalism is rising. Don't let Donald Trump destroy it.|url=http://theweek.com/articles/638440/new-nationalism-rising-dont-let-donald-trump-destroy|work=The Week|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in November 2016 that "new nationalists are riding high on promises to close borders and restore societies to a past homogeneity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=League of nationalists|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21710276-all-around-world-nationalists-are-gaining-ground-why-league-nationalists|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarence Page]] wrote in the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' that "a new neo-tribal nationalism has boiled up in European politics and to a lesser degree in the United States since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global economic meltdown of 2008]],"&lt;ref name="lasvegassun"/&gt; and Ryan Cooper in ''The Week''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theweek.com/articles/685813/great-recession-clearly-gave-rise-rightwing-populism|title=The Great Recession clearly gave rise to right-wing populism|author=Ryan Cooper|date=15 March 2017|work=The Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers with the [[Centre for Economic Policy Research]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/political-aftermath-financial-crises-going-extremes|title=The political aftermath of financial crises: Going to extremes|author1=Manuel Funke|author2=Moritz Schularick|author3=Christoph Trebesch|website=Voxeu.org|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have linked 21st-century [[right-wing populism]] to the [[Great Recession]]. According to Harvard political theorist [[Yascha Mounk]], "economic stagnation among lower- and middle-class whites [has been] a main driver for nationalism's rise around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Detrow|first1=Scott|title=From 'Brexit' To Trump, Nationalist Movements Gain Momentum Around World|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/25/483400958/from-brexit-to-trump-nationalist-movements-gain-momentum-around-world|agency=[[NPR]]|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to religion scholar Mark L. Movesian, new nationalism "sets the nation-state against supranational, liberal regimes like the EU or NAFTA, and local customs and traditions, including religious traditions, against alien, outside trends."&lt;ref name="Movesian"/&gt;

[[David Brog]] and [[Yoram Hazony]] wrote in ''[[National Review]]'' that some conservatives view the new nationalism associated with [[Brexit]] and [[Donald Trump]] as a betrayal of [[Conservatism|conservative]] ideology while they see it as a "return".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brog|first1=David|last2=Hazony|first2=Yoram|authorlink1=David Brog|authorlink2=Yoram Hazony|title=The Nationalist Spirit of 2016: A Conservative Spring|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442826/conservatives-nationalists-2106-brexit-donald-trump-internationalism|work=[[National Review]]|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to conservative commentator [[Jonah Goldberg]], the nationalism associated with Trump is "really little more than a brand name for generic white [[identity politics]]."&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt;

Writing for ''The Week'', Damon Linker called the idea of neo-nationalism being racist "nonsense" and went on to say that "the tendency of progressives to describe it as nothing but 'racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia'—is the desire to delegitimize any particularistic attachment or form of solidarity, be it national, linguistic, religious, territorial, or ethnic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/649886/liberals-keep-denigrating-new-nationalism-racist-nonsense|title=Liberals keep denigrating the new nationalism as racist. This is nonsense.|date=21 September 2016|website=Theweek.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding new nationalism, ''The Economist'' said that "Mr Trump needs to realise that his policies will unfold in the context of other countries’ jealous nationalism," and called nationalism itself a "slippery concept" that is "easy to manipulate". They also repeatedly contrasted [[ethnic nationalism]] and [[civic nationalism]] and implied new nationalism could become "angry" and difficult to control, citing [[Chinese nationalism]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21710249-his-call-put-america-first-donald-trump-latest-recruit-dangerous|title=The new nationalism|website=Economist.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated politicians, parties and events==

'''New Age Orientalism''' describes a modern, Western perception of [[Tibet]], and other Asian majority countries. The term was coined by, [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Donald Swell Lopez Jr.]], who specializes in Western discourse on [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez Jr|first=Donald Sewell|date=1994|title=New age orientalism: the case of Tibet|url=|journal=Tricycle: The Buddhist Journal|volume=3|pages=36–43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lsa.umich.edu/asian/people/faculty/dlopez.html|title=Donald S.

It is the traditional homeland of the [[Tibetan people]] as well as some other [[Ethnic group|ethnic groups]] such as [[Monpa people|Monpa]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], and [[Lhoba people|Lhoba peoples]] and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tibet|date=2018-08-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tibet&amp;oldid=856854724|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Orientalism on Tibet'''==

[[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Dr. Donald S. Lopez Jr.]] studied the depiction of Tibet in Western academic writing throughout history. He found that, before the New Age movement, the depiction of Tibet was often cynical and derogatory. The demeaning features that define Orientalism, characterized the portrayal of Tibet, before the emergence of New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Self-aggrandizing of the Orient ===
In line with the logic of opposites, members of Western academia stressed their superiority (particularly regarding their academic abilities) and used this as a justification to patronize the Orient. With the modern period came Colonialism, when new knowledge of the Eastern world sparked western scholars to write about foreign histories, cultures, and traditions, despite having a sparse and incomplete understanding of them. The Western world, a majority of which was engaging in colonialism, considered The Eastern world to be incapable of representing itself due to its non-western mechanisms of knowledge. The colonial philosophy of manifest destiny led western scholars to believe that they had a more civilized and valuable way of expression, and so western academics took it upon themselves to document societies, such as Tibet, from their perspectives. Often described as 'backward' or 'incapable,' particularly in self-governance, such portrayals helped to fuel racist and white supremacist beliefs of Asian peoples across the west. Such western scholars considered both China and Tibet to be “Oriental Despotisms,” to which the politically organized and colonizing Western world was meant to civilize. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Gaining and justifying authority ===
[[Manifest destiny]], along with larger ideologies of [[racism]] and [[white supremacy]], were used as a method of justifying imperialism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Eve|date=2016|title=Orientalist commercializations: Tibetan Buddhism in American popular film|url=https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1852&amp;amp=&amp;context=jrf&amp;amp=&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.de%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Dde%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C5%2526q%253D%252522new%252Bage%252BOrientalism%252522%252Bmullen%2526oq%253Dmull#search=%22new%20age%20Orientalism%20mullen%22|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Film|volume=2.2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When control of Tibet was taken by western forces for periods of time, western understandings of self-superiority helped to fuel the sense of entitlement, which explained such [[Colonialism|colonial violence]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

However, western powers never fully succeeded in gaining imperial control of Tibet, despite [[British expedition to Tibet|Britain]] and [[Foreign relations of Tibet#Russia and The Great Game|Russia's]] considerable military efforts. According to a western-centric understanding, Tibet never [[Modernization theory|modernized,]] refusing to adopt European-style education systems or norms. Throughout the course of the 19th and 20th century, Tibet remained inaccessible to Western powers, and was therefore predominantly portrayed as isolated, closed, and uncivilized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=='''New Age Orientalism and Tibet'''==

Embedded in the [[New Age|New Age movement]], New Age Orientalism describes the positive Western perception of old Tibet (before the [[Chinese invasion of Tibet|Chinese invasion 1950]] and [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan diaspora 1959)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This portrayal of Tibet in the modern Western Societies, has been criticized for romanticizing old Tibetan reality and neglecting negative aspects of its society, such as, violence or the clerical, feudal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDuqayOx2Nw|title=Colin Goldner: Hinter dem Lächeln des Dalai Lama (Vortrag Univ.

New Age Orientalism, subsequently, describes the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] perception of Tibet, in which Tibet is no longer depreciated but, rather, romanticized. It is based on the tradition of continued [[Romantic Orientalism]], “in which the ‘West’ perceives some lack within itself and fantasizes that the answer, through a process of projection, is to be found somewhere in the ‘East.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this manner, the four characteristics of Orientalism persist with slight variation. The logic of opposites, now relates to the old Tibet and China. Tibet is no longer perceived as an antiquated, "oriental despotism," but as a [[Shangri-La]] -- positive, holy, pristine, and pure, which is perceived as incorrupt, since it was never dominated by the West. The Chinese constitute the opposite, as the evil, subhuman force invading the land of peaceful, devoted inhabitants. The old Tibetan culture seems removed from time and history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This allows the West to aggrandize themselves as rescuers of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism (see [[Free Tibet|'Free Tibet']] movement), whereas, [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are depicted as helpless and voiceless. Ultimately, the West again finds itself in a patronizing position, representing another culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== New Age Orientalism in popular culture ===

The romanticized picture of Tibet has, partly, been constructed and reflected by [[popular culture]]. Hollywood movies such as [[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven years in Tibet]], [[Kundun]], and [[Little Buddha]], were found to draw a [[Romanticism|romanticized]] image of Tibet, and hold up the Western rescue paradigm, in line with the play of opposites, between China and Tibet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, publications surrounding the '[[Free Tibet]]' movement have been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The constructed fantasies of a Shangri-La Tibet, are found to reflect back on the Western struggles, within their own national identity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as, pitfalls of [[Globalization|globalization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
=='''Expansion of New Age Orientialism'''==

In academic literature, the concept of New Age Orientalism, originally relating to Tibet, has been expanded and applied to other cultures and religions, such as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt; The discourse and perception on [[Ayurveda]], for instance, has been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=='''Criticism of New Age Orientialism'''==

Dr. Donald Lopez's concept of New Age Orientalism, has been criticized for placing too much weight on the impact and power of Orientalism, and viewing Tibet as a closed totality, removed from history. Alternatives to Orientalism are not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreyfus|first=Georges|date=2005|title=Are We Prisoners of Shangrila?

The '''Nordic Council''' is the official body for formal inter-parliamentary co-operation among the [[Nordic countries]]. Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] as well as from the autonomous areas of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Åland Islands]]. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council. The official and working languages of both the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, which comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and learned as a foreign language by the remaining 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=2008-08-06|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas, amongst them being the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|last=ERR|date=2017-06-22|work=ERR|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During World War II, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] were occupied by [[Germany]]; [[Finland]] was [[Winter War|under assault]] by the [[Soviet Union]]; while [[Sweden]], though neutral, still felt the war's effects. Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.

It was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]]. Étienne Deschamps. Translated by the CVCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953–1971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

This move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjavík]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation ("[[Nordek]]") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Nordek was then abandoned.

As a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.&lt;ref name="HM1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Åland Islands|Åland]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.&lt;ref name="HM2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972–1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.

In the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983&lt;ref name="HM2"/&gt; and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

Following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the [[Baltic states]] and new Baltic Sea organisations. Sweden and Finland joined the [[European Union]] (EU), the EEC's successor, in 1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership.&lt;ref name="HM3"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 After 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120103903/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; However, Norway and Iceland did join the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) which integrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also subsumed into the EU's [[Schengen Area]] in 1996.

The Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the [[Arctic]], Baltic, Europe, and [[Canada]]. The [[Øresund Bridge]] linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce barriers.&lt;ref name="HM3"/&gt; However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the EU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union|EU membership talks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/11/03/further-icelandic-support-for-eu-membership/#more-4118 |title=Further Icelandic support for EU membership &amp;#124; IceNews – Daily News |publisher=Icenews.is |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to annul these in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/iceland-drops-european-union-membership-bid |title=Iceland drops EU membership bid: 'interests better served outside' union |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Language understanding===

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a particular focus on strengthening the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic language]] community; the main focus of their work to promote language understanding in the Nordic countries is on children and young people's understanding of written and oral Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the three mutually intelligible Scandinavian languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.comingsoon.no/en/theme/education-and-research-in-the-nordic-region/language Language co-operation], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the Council have the ability to issue proposals in their own languages, and official documents are translated to cater to all five of the major Nordic languages. Discussions for bringing Finnish and Icelandic into equal footing with the three other languages has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/fi/ajankohtaista/uutiset/suomen-ja-islannin-kielen-asemaa-parannetaan-pohjoismaisessa-yhteistyoessae|title=Suomen ja islannin kielen asemaa parannetaan pohjoismaisessa yhteistyössä|date=2017-11-02|access-date=2018-06-01|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
=== Council ===
The Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called "theme session" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories{{spaced ndash}}Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Åland{{spaced ndash}}also have Nordic secretariats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/about-the-nordic-council About the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council uses the three Continental [[Scandinavian languages]] ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) as its official working languages, but also publishes material in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[English language|English]] for information purposes. The council refers to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be different forms of the same language forming a common language community.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/ |title=Norden |date=11 September 2009 |work=Norden |publisher=Norden.org |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police and social security offices. The languages included are Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428022430/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its national legislature. With Denmark, Norway, and Iceland being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation.

===Council of Ministers===
The original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation. [http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers The ''Nordic Council of Ministers''], founded in 1971, is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work. The autonomous territories have the same representation as states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers The Nordic Council of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary General ===
*[[Secretary-General of the Nordic Council]]

== Location ==
[[File:Norden Copenhagen.JPG|thumb|Nordic Council headquarters in Copenhagen. White building with Norden sign and flag at street Ved Stranden No. 18]]
The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in [[Copenhagen]] and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at [[Ved Stranden]] No. 18, close to [[Slotsholmen]].

== Members ==
&lt;!-- Do NOT add alleged "observers" to this section. First of all, this is a section on MEMBERS, not observers, which are two different things. Cooperation with the Baltic states belongs in the next section on such cooperation. Secondly, it has been established that the Nordic Council has no official observer status (Talk:Nordic countries). As sessions are open to the public, anyone may be present and "observe" the proceedings, but that doesn't make them "observer members" in a formal sense, like at the UN, where observer status gives many formal rights. As this article already discusses, observer status for the Baltic states was explicitly rejected, and there is no evidence presented that the council has made any other decision in this matter since (more on this on Talk:Nordic countries, where the matter was debated to death) --&gt;

The Nordic Council has 8 members, 5 sovereign states and 3 self-governing regions.

==Observer, guests and other cooperation with neighbouring countries and regions==

In accordance with § 13 of the Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council the [[Sámi Parliamentary Council]] is the only institution with observer status with the Nordic Council. In accordance with § 14, the Nordic Youth Council has the status of "guest" on a permanent basis, and the Presidium "may invite representatives of popularly elected bodies and other persons to a session and grant them speaking rights" as guests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/bag-om-nordisk-raad/the-nordic-council/rules-of-procedure-for-the-nordic-council Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the council, "within the last couple of years, guests from other international and Nordic organisations have been able to take part in the debates at the Sessions. Visitors from the Baltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this opportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are invited to the Theme Session."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/sessions-and-meetings/nordic-council-sessions/about-the-sessions-of-the-nordic-council About the Sessions of the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council of Ministers has established four ''Offices outside the Nordic Region'', namely in all the [[Baltic states]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]&amp;nbsp;– and the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt; The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic Council of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary mission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies within the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;''Planer och budget 2016'', p. 71, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers define [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Russia]] as "Adjacent Areas" and has formal cooperation with them under the Adjacent Areas policies framework; in recent years the cooperation has focused increasingly on Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in the Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status in the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was heavily opposed by the [[Soviet Union]], accusing the Nordic Council of getting involved in its internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsuxRJH&amp;sig=CzVoYbflgNMAIdhyDNtWfiDdtk0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+nordic+council+observer+1991&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsvpPKI&amp;sig=vVIg3P4gkhs6kJnW-goho8laWeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi53MbMjK3WAhVHQJoKHW_QDmkQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20nordic%20council%20observer%201991&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Nordic Council refused to give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=OMFdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6PVUeUqmHs&amp;sig=cRt4I8tK-gjmM2hSIgRRlK2FyTc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal observer status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on different levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states and Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of Schleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the first time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border cooperation with Denmark and has a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html Schleswig-Holstein for the first time uses its observer status in the Nordic Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117110624/http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html |date=17 November 2016 }} (in German), Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 1 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As parliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] and a member of the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|Social Democrats]] with ties to the Danish minority were elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/infothek/wahl18/drucks/4800/drucksache-18-4839.pdf Election of observational members to the Nordic Council], Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 3 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Sami people|Sámi]] political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic Council's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the Sámi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the Sámi people are de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In addition, the [[Faroe Islands]] have expressed their wishes for full membership in the Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/the-faroe-islands-apply-for-membership-in-the-nordic-council-and-nordic-council-of-ministers-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently{{When|date=March 2018}}, three of the members of the Nordic Council ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]], all [[Member state of the European Union|EU-member states]]), the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]] sought intensifying cooperation in the [[Digital Single Market]], as well as discussing social matters, the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[European migrant crisis]] and defense cooperation. Relations with [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia]], [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkey]] and the [[Brexit|United Kingdom]] was also on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nordic unification ==
{{further|Scandinavism}}
 
Some desire the Nordic Council's promotion of Nordic cooperation to go much further than at present. If the states of Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland were to merge in such an integration as some desire, it would command a gross domestic product of US$1.60 trillion, making it the twelfth largest economy in the world, larger than that of Australia, Spain, Mexico or South Korea. Gunnar Wetterberg, a Swedish historian and economist, wrote a book entered into the Nordic Council's year book that proposes the creation of a Nordic Federation from the Council in a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Wetterberg, Gunnar (3 November 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/31188 Comment The United Nordic Federation], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6413">'''Participatory poverty assessment''' (PPA) is the approach to analyzing and reducing poverty by incorporating the views of the poor. PPAs attempt to better understand the poor, to give the poor more influence over decisions that affect their lives, and to increase effectiveness of poverty reduction policies.&lt;ref name="ppa_guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/238411/ppa.pdf |title=A rough guide to PPAs |author=Andy Norton with Bella Bird Karen Brock Margaret Kakande Carrie Turk |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hakikazi.org/tcdd/newpage7.htm |title=Presentation on Introduction to Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) |publisher=Hakikazi Catalyst |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPAs are seen as complements to traditional household surveys by helping to interpret survey results, and aim to capture the experiences of the poor by being more open-ended.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiii,xv}}

==History==

Before the 1990s, household-survey approaches were the main way to measure poverty. This shifted to participatory activities in the 1990s after critiques of these traditional methods.&lt;ref name="mcgee"&gt;McGee, Rosemary, ed. ''Knowing Poverty''. London, GB: Routledge, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 11 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,3}}

The term "participatory poverty assessment" was coined within the [[World Bank]] in 1992,&lt;ref name=ppa_guide/&gt; and was seen as a participatory form of poverty assessments (PAs, i.e. survey-based approaches).&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|2,3}}

Early experiences of PPAs were in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|3}}

By 1998, 43 PPAs had been conducted: 28 in Africa, 6 in Latin America, 5 in Eastern Europe, and 4 in Asia.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiii,xiv,15}}

Early PPAs focused most on making higher quality information available to policy makers, rather than seeing the poor as itself being involved in the process of reducing poverty.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Later in the 1990s, "second generation" PPAs appeared, which tried to allow the poor to influence policy decisions.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|4}}

As of 2012, the [[World Bank]]'s [[Voices of the Poor]] is the largest PPA ever to have been conducted.&lt;ref name=mcgee/&gt;{{rp|4}}

==Rationale and comparison to previous methods==

Both PPAs and traditional surveys contain both quantitative and qualitative information, as well as "subjective" and "objective" parts, so this is not necessarily a distinguishing feature of PPAs.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|4}} Rather:

{{quote |text=Traditional survey data can be used to count, compare, and predict.  The strength of the PPA is not in counting but rather in understanding hidden dimensions of poverty and analyzing causality and processes by which people fall into and get out of poverty.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}}}

PPAs are also distinguished from anthropological studies because the latter analyze few communities in depth, whereas PPAs analyze various communities of a country. PPAs also focus on policy decisions (which anthropological studies don't need to).&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5,6}}

==Types of methodologies and activities==

Within PPAs, various methodologies exist. Some PPAs use more than one methodology.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|6}}

* Field work and conducting interviews&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Rapid rural appraisal
* [[Participatory rural appraisal]] (includes use of visuals, such as matrices and diagramming)
* SARAR (self-esteem, associative strength, resourcefulness, action planning, and responsibility)
* Beneficiary assessment
* Semistructured interviews and focus groups

PPAs can last from several weeks to several months.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Organizations using this approach==

Various organizations have used PPAs as part of their work.

* [[World Bank]]
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|3}}
* [[Department for International Development]]&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|17}}
* [[ActionAid]]
* [[Asian Development Bank]]
* [[Danish International Development Agency]]
* [[Oxfam UK]]
* [[Thailand Development Research Institute]]

In addition, "secondary stakeholders" (i.e. organizations that do not conduct PPAs directly, but participate in PPAs) such as [[UNICEF]], various NGOs (e.g. [[Save the Children]] and [[Oxfam]]), academic institutions, etc., have also participated in PPAs.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Results==

Participatory poverty assessments confirmed the multidimensional nature of poverty (i.e. that the poor deal not just with lack of money, but with various problems like lack of resources, poor health, physical violence, social isolation, etc.) that was seen from traditional household questionnaire-based methods.&lt;ref name="robb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/22/000094946_99040105542482/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf |title=Can the Poor Influence Policy? Participatory Poverty Assessments in the Developing World |author=Caroline M. Robb |year=1999 |publisher=[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} PPAs have also been able to access information that was not obtained in household surveys by building trust. For instance PPAs have obtained information on sensitive topics such as [[child prostitution]], drug use, and [[domestic violence]] in relation to poverty.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xiv}}

In [[Zambia]], PPAs discovered that the timing of school fees caused economic stress for households, so new legislation to change this timing was proposed.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|xv}}

In [[Niger]], a PPA found that the poor see education only as a seventh priority for poverty reduction due to "the concern that what children learn had little relevance to getting people out of poverty". As a result of this PPA, food security was prioritized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/09/21/000160016_20060921172552/Rendered/PDF/373930PAPER0NE0participatory0poverty.pdf |title=Participatory Poverty Assessment - Niger}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vii}}

PPAs have also informed World Bank's [[World Development Report]]s.&lt;ref name=robb/&gt;{{rp|vi}}

'''''Pathogens and Global Health''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] published by [[Maney Publishing]]. It covers [[tropical disease]]s, including their [[microbiology]], [[epidemiology]] and [[molecular biology]], as well as [[medical entomology]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Andrea Crisanti (scientist)|Andrea Crisanti]] ([[Imperial College London]]).

==History==
The journal was established by Sir [[Ronald Ross]] in 1906 as ''Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology'' to share the results of the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]]'s research and field expeditions. In May 2011, the journal was purchased by Maney Publishing, obtaining its current title in 2012, reflecting a broader focus including the [[biology]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], treatment, and control of [[pathogens]] of medical relevance beyond a regional definition.

A '''people's history''', or '''history from below''',&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Thompson, "History from Below", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 7 April 1966, pp. 279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[historical narrative]] which attempts to account for historical events from the perspective of common people rather than leaders. There is an emphasis on [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the poor, the nonconformists, and otherwise marginal groups. The authors are typically on the left and have a Marxist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "History from below" and "people's history" ==
[[Lucien Febvre]] first used the phrase "histoire vue d'en bas et non d'en haut" (history seen from below and not from above) in 1932 when praising [[Albert Mathiez]] for seeking to tell the "histoire des masses et non de vedettes" (history of the masses and not of starlets).&lt;ref&gt;When the State Trembled 1442660228 Reinhold Kramer, Tom Mitchell - 2010 "It was Lucien Febvre who first used the phrase 'history from below' when in 1932 he observed that Albert Mathiez, a founding member of the Annales tradition, had sought 'histoire des masses et non de vedettes; histoire vue d'en bas en non ..."&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in the title of [[A. L. Morton]]'s 1938 book, ''A People's History of England''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grahamstevenson.me.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=418:a-l-morton&amp;catid=13:m&amp;Itemid=114 AL Morton] Compendium of Communist Biographies, Graham Stevenson, Accessed Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was [[E. P. Thompson]]'s essay ''History from Below'' in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' (1966) which brought the phrase to the forefront of historiography from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Black and MacRaild ''Studying History'' 2007 Page 113 "E. P. Thompson's essay, 'History from below', in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' (1966), was the real starting point, not only of the term, but of attempts to define it, to intellectualise about it, and to give it a coherent agenda...."&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized among non-historians by Howard Zinn's 1980 book, ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''.

[[Guy Beiner]] has pointed out that "the Neo-Marxist flag-bearers of history from below have at times resorted to idealized and insufficiently sophisticated notions of ‘the people’, unduly ascribing to them innate progressive values".&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beiner, [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/forgetful-remembrance-9780198749356? Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster (Oxford University Press, 2018)], pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A people's history is the history as the story of mass movements and of the outsiders.  Individuals not included in the past in other type of writing about history are part of history-from-below theory's primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the nonconformists, the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and the otherwise forgotten people. This theory also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.

This [[Historical revisionism|revisionist approach]] to writing history is in direct opposition to methods which tend to emphasize single great figures in history, referred to as the [[Great Man theory]]; it argues that the driving factor of history is the daily life of ordinary people, their [[social status]] and [[profession]]. These are the factors that "push and pull" on opinions and allow for trends to develop, as opposed to great people introducing ideas or initiating events.

In his book ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', [[Howard Zinn]] wrote: "The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinncol1.html chapter: Columbus, The Indians, and Human Progress]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary boundaries''' is a concept involving Earth system processes which contain environmental boundaries, proposed in 2009 by a group of [[Earth system science|Earth system]] and [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] led by [[Johan Rockström]] from the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]] and [[Will Steffen]] from the [[Australian National University]]. The group wanted to define a "safe operating space for humanity" for the international community, including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society, the scientific community and the [[private sector]], as a precondition for [[sustainable development]]. The framework is based on scientific evidence that human actions since the [[Industrial Revolution]] have become the main driver of global environmental change. 

According to the paradigm, "transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental-to planetary-scale systems."&lt;ref name="Rockstrom09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=iss_pub|title=Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity|year=2009|authors=Rockström et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earth system process boundaries mark the safe zone for the planet to the extent that they are not crossed. As of 2009, two boundaries have already been crossed, while others are in imminent danger of being crossed.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, {{Harvnb|Nature|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockstrom09"/&gt;

==History of framework==
[[File:Planetary Boundaries.png|thumb|Planetary boundaries diagram of 2009.]]

In 2009, a group of [[Earth system science|Earth system]] and [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] led by [[Johan Rockström]] from the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]] and [[Will Steffen]] from the [[Australian National University]] collaborated with 26 leading academics, including [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel]] laureate [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] climate scientist [[James Hansen]] and the [[German Chancellor]]'s chief climate adviser [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]] and identified nine "planetary life support systems" essential for human survival, attempting to quantify how far seven of these systems had been pushed already.  They estimated how much further humans can go before [[planetary habitability]] is threatened.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Estimates indicated that three of these boundaries—[[climate change]], [[biodiversity]] loss, and the biogeochemical flow boundary—appear to have been crossed. The boundaries were "rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps" which interact in complex ways that are not yet well understood. Boundaries were defined to help define a "safe space for human development", which was an improvement on approaches aiming at minimizing [[Human impact on the environment|human impacts]] on the planet.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt; The 2009 report&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt; was presented to the General Assembly of the [[Club of Rome]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|2009}} (presentation).&lt;/ref&gt; An edited summary of the report was published as the featured article in a special 2009 edition of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|others|2009b}}.  &lt;!--

In 2015, a second paper was published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' to update the Planetary Boundaries concept&lt;ref name="SteffenEtAl2015" /&gt; and findings were presented at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, January 2015.

A 2018 study, co-authored by Rockström, calls into question the international agreement to limit warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures set forth in the [[Paris Agreement]].  The scientists raise the possibility that even if [[greenhouse gas]] emissions are [[Climate change mitigation|substantially reduced]] to limit warming to 2 degrees, that might be the  "threshold" at which self-reinforcing [[climate feedbacks]] add additional warming until the [[Climate|climate system]] stabilizes in a [[Climate state#Hothouse|hothouse climate state]]. This would make parts of the world uninhabitable, raise sea levels by up to {{convert|60|m|ft}}, and raise temperatures by {{convert|4-5|C-change}} to levels that are higher than any [[interglacial]] period in the past 1.2 million years. Rockström notes that whether this would occur "is one of the most existential questions in science." Study author Katherine Richardson stresses, "We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2 °C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions. This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/31/1810141115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1810141115|journal=PNAS|title=Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene|authors=Steffen et al.|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state|work=The Guardian|title=Domino-effect of climate events could push Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2018-08-07|accessdate=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Terra.png|thumb|The planet [[Earth]] is a finite system, which means it has limits.]]

===The idea===
The idea that our planet has limits, including the burden placed upon it by human activities, has been around for some time. In 1972, ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' was published. It presented a model in which five variables: [[world population]], industrialization, pollution, food production, and [[resources depletion]], are examined, and considered to grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]], whereas the ability of technology to increase resources availability is only [[linear function|linear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meadows|others|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the report was widely dismissed, particularly by economists and businessmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyer|Nørgård|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has often been claimed that history has proved the projections to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Vuuren|Faber|2009}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Graham Turner from the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) published "A comparison of ''The Limits to Growth'' with thirty years of reality".&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|2008}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner found that the observed historical data from 1970 to 2000 closely matches the simulated results of the "standard run" limits of growth model for almost all the outputs reported. "The comparison is well within uncertainty bounds of nearly all the data in terms of both magnitude and the trends over time."&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"/&gt; Turner also examined a number of reports, particularly by economists, which over the years have purported to discredit the limits-to-growth model. Turner says these reports are flawed, and reflect misunderstandings about the model.&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"/&gt; In 2010, Nørgård, Peet and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a "pioneering report", and said that it "has withstood the test of time and, indeed, has only become more relevant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nørgård|Peet|Ragnarsdóttir|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote box
| quote = With few exceptions, economics as a discipline has been dominated by a perception of living in an unlimited world, where resource and pollution problems in one area were solved by moving resources or people to other parts. The very hint of any global limitation as suggested in the report ''The Limits to Growth'' was met with disbelief and rejection by businesses and most economists. However, this conclusion was mostly based on false premises.

''[[Our Common Future]]''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as the {{Harvnb|Brundtland Report|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1987 by United Nations' [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]]. It tried to recapture the spirit of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference]]. Its aim was to interlock the concepts of development and environment for future political discussions. It introduced the famous definition for [[sustainable development]]:

{{quote|"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."|''{{Harvnb|Brundtland Report|1987}}''}}

Of a different kind is the approach made by [[James Lovelock]]. In the 1970s he and [[microbiologist]] [[Lynn Margulis]] presented the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia theory or hypothesis]], that states that all [[organisms]] and their [[inorganic]] surroundings on Earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}; {{Harvnb|Lovelock|Margulis|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The system has the ability to react to perturbations or deviations, much like a living organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature ([[homeostasis]]). Nevertheless, this capacity has limits. For instance, when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range, it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments. Similarly the Earth may not be able to react to large deviations in critical parameters. In his book ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]'', he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity, compounded with the increase of [[greenhouse gas]]es made by humans, is producing [[global warming]].

===From Holocene to Anthropocene===
{{Main|Anthropocene}}

{{quote box
| quote = Our planet’s ability to provide an accommodating environment for humanity is being challenged by our own activities. The environment—our life-support system—is changing rapidly from the stable Holocene state of the last 12,000 years, during which we developed agriculture, villages, cities, and contemporary civilizations, to an unknown future state of significantly different conditions.

The [[Holocene]] began about 10,000 years ago. It is the current [[interglacial]] period, and it has proven to be a relatively stable environment of the Earth. There have been natural environmental fluctuations during the Holocene, but the key atmospheric and biogeochemical parameters have been relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dansgaard|others1993}}; {{Harvnb|Petit|others|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Rioual|others|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This stability and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] has allowed agriculture to develop and complex societies to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Leeuw|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rockström ''et al.'', we "have now become so dependent on those investments for our way of life, and how we have organized society, technologies, and economies around them, that we must take the range within which Earth System processes varied in the Holocene as a scientific reference point for a desirable planetary state."&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

}}

Since the [[industrial revolution]], according to [[Paul J. Crutzen|Paul Crutzen]], Will Steffen and others, the planet has entered a new epoch, the [[Anthropocene]]. In the Anthropocene, humans have become the main agents of change to the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crutzen|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Steffen|Crutzen|McNeill|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Zalasiewicz|others|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been well publicized scientific warnings about risks in the areas of climate change and stratospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}; {{Harvnb|WMO|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other [[biophysical]] processes are also important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Masundire|Baillie|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Folke|others|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Gordon|Peterson|Bennett|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, since the advent of the Anthropocene, the rate at which species are being extinguished has increased over 100 times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Masundire|Baillie|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and humans are now the driving force altering global river flows&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shiklomanov|Rodda|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as water vapor flows from the land surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|Peterson|Bennett|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing pressure on the Earth's biophysical systems from human activities raises concerns that further pressure could be destabilizing, and precipitate sudden or irreversible changes to the environment. According to Rockström et al., "Up to 30% of all mammal, bird, and amphibian species will be threatened with extinction this century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rockström|first=John|date=2009|title=Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity|url=|journal=Ecology and society : a journal of integrative science for resilience and sustainability|volume=14 |issue=2|pages=473|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to address the issue, because the predominant paradigms of social and economic development are largely indifferent to the looming possibilities of large scale environmental disasters triggered by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stern|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal boundaries can help keep human activities in check, but are only as effective as the political will to make and enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Nine boundaries==
'''Thresholds and  boundaries'''

The ''threshold'', or climatological [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]], is the value at which a very small increment for the control variable (like CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produces a large, possibly catastrophic, change in the response variable (global warming).

The threshold points are difficult to locate, because the Earth System is very complex. Instead of defining the threshold value, the study establishes a range, and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it. The lower end of that range is defined as the ''boundary''. Therefore, it defines a safe space, in the sense that as long as we are below the boundary, we are below the threshold value. If the boundary is crossed, we enter into a danger zone.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

The proposed framework lays the groundwork for shifting approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative [[Externality|externaliti]]es, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the "planetary playing field" for humanity if major [[Human impact on the environment|human-induced environmental change]] on a global scale is to be avoided

Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be highly damaging or even catastrophic, due to the risk of crossing thresholds that trigger non-linear, abrupt [[environmental change]] within [[continent]]al- to planetary-scale systems. The 2009 study identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentration in the atmosphere &lt; 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in [[radiative forcing]]); [[ocean acidification]] (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] levels); [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] ozone (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric [[Ozone|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] from a pre-industrial level of 290 [[Dobson Unit]]s); [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen (N) cycle]] (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 35 Tg N/yr) and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus (P) cycle]] (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background [[weathering]] of P); global freshwater use (&lt; 4000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (&lt; 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of &lt; 10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which the group had not yet been able to determine a boundary level are [[Air pollution|chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading]].

==Debate==
===On the framework===
{{quote box
| quote = &lt;center&gt;'''From the  [[Stockholm Memorandum]]'''&lt;/center&gt; Science indicates that we are transgressing planetary boundaries that have kept civilization safe for the past 10,000 years. Evidence is growing that human pressures are starting to overwhelm the Earth’s buffering capacity. Humans are now the most significant driver of [[global change]], propelling the planet into a new geological epoch, the [[Anthropocene]]. We can no longer exclude the possibility that our collective actions will trigger tipping points, risking abrupt and irreversible consequences for human communities and ecological systems.

[[Christopher Field]], director of the [[Carnegie Institution|Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology]], is impressed: "This kind of work is critically important. Overall, this is an impressive attempt to define a safety zone."&lt;ref name="Zimmer 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the conservation biologist [[Stuart Pimm]] is not impressed: "I don’t think this is in any way a useful way of thinking about things... The notion of a single boundary is just devoid of serious content. In what way is an extinction rate 10 times the background rate acceptable?"&lt;ref name="Zimmer 2009"/&gt; and the environmental policy analyst [[William C. Clark|Bill Clark]] thinks: "Tipping points in the earth system are dense, unpredictable... and unlikely to be avoidable through early warning indicators. It follows that... 'safe operating spaces' and 'planetary boundaries' are thus highly suspect and potentially the new 'opiates'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biogeochemist [[William H. Schlesinger|William Schlesinger]] queries whether thresholds are a good idea for pollutions at all. He thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. "Management based on thresholds, although attractive in its simplicity, allows pernicious, slow and diffuse degradation to persist nearly indefinitely."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schlesinger|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologist David Molden thinks planetary boundaries are a welcome new approach in the 'limits to growth' debate. "As a scientific organizing principle, the concept has many strengths ... the numbers are important because they provide targets for policymakers, giving a clear indication of the magnitude and direction of change. They also provide benchmarks and direction for science. As we improve our understanding of Earth processes and complex inter-relationships, these benchmarks can and will be updated ... we now have a tool we can use to help us think more deeply—and urgently—about planetary limits and the critical actions we have to take."&lt;ref name="Molden 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Molden|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ocean chemist]] Peter Brewer queries whether it is "truly useful to create a list of environmental limits without serious plans for how they may be achieved ... they may become just another stick to beat citizens with. Disruption of the global nitrogen cycle is one clear example: it is likely that a large fraction of people on Earth would not be alive today without the artificial production of fertilizer. How can such ethical and economic issues be matched with a simple call to set limits? ... food is not optional."&lt;ref name="Brewer 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment advisor Steve Bass says the "description of planetary boundaries is a sound idea. We need to know how to live within the unusually stable conditions of our present Holocene period and not do anything that causes irreversible environmental change ... Their paper has profound implications for future governance systems, offering some of the 'wiring' needed to link governance of national and global economies with governance of the environment and natural resources. The planetary boundaries concept should enable policymakers to understand more clearly that, like human rights and representative government, environmental change knows no borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bass|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate change policy advisor [[Adele Morris]] thinks that price-based policies are also needed to avoid political and economic thresholds. "Staying within a 'safe operating space' will require staying within all the relevant boundaries, including the electorate’s willingness to pay."&lt;ref name="Morris 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box
| quote = In summary, the planetary boundary concept is a very important one, and its proposal should now be followed by discussions of the connections between the various boundaries and of their association with other concepts such as the '[[limits to growth]]'. Importantly, this novel concept highlights the risk of reaching thresholds or tipping points for non-linear or abrupt changes in Earth-system processes. As such, it can help society to reach the agreements required for dealing effectively with existing global environmental threats, such as climate change.

In their report (2012) entitled "Resilient People, Resilient Planet: A future worth choosing", The High-level Panel on Global Sustainability called for bold global efforts, "including launching a major global scientific initiative, to strengthen the interface between science and policy. We must define, through science, what scientists refer to as "planetary boundaries", "environmental thresholds" and "tipping points"."&lt;ref&gt;

In 2011, at their second meeting, the High-level Panel on Global Sustainability&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/gsp High-level Panel on Global Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; of the United Nations had incorporated the concept of  planetary boundaries into their framework, stating that their goal was: "To eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, make growth inclusive, and production and consumption more sustainable while combating climate change and respecting the range of other planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN GSP 2 meeting|2011}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in their proceedings, panel members have expressed reservations about the political effectiveness of using the concept of "planetary boundaries": "Planetary boundaries are still an evolving concept that should be used with caution [...] The planetary boundaries question can be divisive as it can be perceived as a tool of the "North" to tell the "South" not to follow the resource intensive and environmentally destructive development pathway that rich countries took themselves... This language is unacceptable to most of the developing countries as they fear that an emphasis on boundaries would place unacceptable brakes on poor countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN Sherpa 3 meeting|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the concept is routinely used in the proceedings of the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN Agenda 21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''UN Daily News''. For example, the [[UNEP]] Executive Director [[Achim Steiner]] states that the challenge of agriculture is to "feed a growing global population without pushing humanity's [[Ecological footprint|footprint]] beyond planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/news/dh/pdf/english/2011/01062011.pdf Sustainable agriculture key to green growth, poverty reduction] ''UN Daily News'', 1 June 2011, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Yearbook 2010 also repeated Rockström's message, conceptually linking it with [[ecosystem management]] and [[Sustainable Governance Indicators|environmental governance indicators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UNEP|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The planetary boundaries concept is also used in proceedings by the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Budapest Declaration}}; {{Harvnb|Greenfield|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to in the [[European Environment Agency]] synthesis report ''The European environment – state and outlook 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|Henrichs|others|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate change====
[[File:Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and global annual average temperatures over the years 1880 to 2009.png|thumb|300px|right|The black line shows the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration for the period 1880–2008. Red bars show temperatures above and blue bars show temperatures below the average temperature. Year-to-year temperature fluctuations are due to natural processes, such as the effects of [[El Niño]], [[La Niña]], and the eruption of large volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|USGCRP|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Radiative forcing]] is a measure of the difference between the incoming [[Irradiance|radiation energy]] and the outgoing radiation energy acting across the boundary of the earth. Positive radiative forcing results in warming. From the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2005, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to a positive radiative forcing, averaging about 1.66&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, "[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-human-and.html Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change]". &lt;!-- Same link, formerly titled "Figure SPM.2". --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate scientist [[Myles Allen]] thinks setting "a limit on long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations merely distracts from the much more immediate challenge of limiting warming to 2 °C." He says the concentration of carbon dioxide is not a control variable we can "meaningfully claim to control", and he questions whether keeping carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm will avoid more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C of warming.&lt;ref name="Allen 2009"/&gt;

Adele Morris, policy director, Climate and Energy Economics Project, [[Brookings Institution]], makes a criticism from the economical-political point of view. She puts emphasis in choosing policies that minimize costs and preserve consensus.  She favors a system of [[carbon tax|green-house gas emissions tax]], and [[emissions trading]], as ways to prevent global warming. She thinks that too-ambitious objectives, like the boundary limit on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, may discourage such actions.&lt;ref name="Morris 2010"/&gt;

====Biodiversity loss====
According to the biologist [[Cristián Samper]], a " boundary that expresses the probability of families of species disappearing over time would better reflect our potential impacts on the future of life on Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Samper|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation ecologist Gretchen Daily claims that "it is time to confront the hard truth that traditional approaches to conservation, taken alone, are doomed to fail. Nature reserves are too small, too few, too isolated and too subject to change to support more than a tiny fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. The challenge is to make conservation attractive—from economic and cultural perspectives. We cannot go on treating nature like an all-you-can-eat buffet. We depend on nature for food security, clean water, climate stability, seafood, timber, and other biological and physical services. To maintain these benefits, we need not just remote reserves but places everywhere—more like 'ecosystem service stations.' A few pioneers are integrating conservation and human development. The Costa Rican government is paying landowners for [[ecosystem services]] from tropical forests, including carbon offsets, hydropower production, biodiversity conservation and scenic beauty. [[China]] is investing $100 billion in "ecocompensation," including innovative policy and finance mechanisms that reward conservation and restoration. The country is also creating "ecosystem function conservation areas" that make up 18 percent of its land area.  Colombia and South Africa have made dramatic policy changes, too. Three advances would help the rest of the world scale such models of success. One: new science and tools to value and account for [[natural capital]], in biophysical, economic and other terms [...] Two: compelling demonstrations of such tools in resource policy. Three: cooperation among governments, development organizations, corporations and communities to help nations build more durable economies while also maintaining critical ecosystem services."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daily|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|380px|right|[[Nitrogen cycle]]]]

==== Nitrogen cycle ====
Since the industrial revolution, the Earth's [[nitrogen cycle]] has been disturbed even more than the carbon cycle. "Human activities now convert more nitrogen from the atmosphere into reactive forms than all of the Earth´s terrestrial processes combined. Much of this new reactive nitrogen pollutes waterways and coastal zones, is emitted back to the atmosphere in changed forms, or accumulates in the terrestrial biosphere."&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockholm Resilience Centre|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small part of the fertilizers applied in agriculture is used by plants. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus ends up in rivers, lakes and the sea, where excess amounts stress aquatic ecosystems. For example, fertilizer which discharges from rivers into the Gulf of Mexico has damaged [[Shrimp fishery|shrimp fisheries]] because of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The biogeochemist [[William H. Schlesinger|William Schlesinger]]  thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit for nitrogen deposition and other pollutions will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. He says the boundary suggested for phosphorus is not sustainable, and would exhaust the known phosphorus reserves in less than 200 years.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2009"/&gt;

With regard to nitrogen, the biogeochemist and ecosystem scientist Robert Howarth says: "Human activity has greatly altered the flow of nitrogen across the globe. The single largest contributor is fertilizer use. But the burning of fossil fuels actually dominates the problem in some regions, such as the northeastern U.S. The solution in that case is to conserve energy and use it more efficiently. Hybrid vehicles are another excellent fix; their nitrogen emissions are significantly less than traditional vehicles because their engines turn off while the vehicle is stopped. (Emissions from conventional vehicles actually rise when the engine is idling.) Nitrogen emissions from U.S. power plants could be greatly reduced, too, if plants that predate the Clean Air Act and its amendments were required to comply; these plants pollute far out of proportion to the amount of electricity they produce.

In agriculture, many farmers could use less fertilizer, and the reductions in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate only the top few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops, such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. Better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations|concentrated animal feeding operations]] (CAFOs) is a huge problem.

As recently as the 1970s, most animals were fed local crops, and the animals’ wastes were returned to the fields as fertilizer. Today most U.S. animals are fed crops grown hundreds of miles away, making it “uneconomical” to return the manure. The solution? Require CAFO owners to treat their wastes, just as municipalities must do with human wastes. Further, if we ate less meat, less waste would be generated and less synthetic fertilizer would be needed to grow animal feed. Eating meat from animals that are range-fed on perennial grasses would be ideal. The explosive growth in the production of ethanol as a biofuel is greatly aggravating nitrogen pollution. Several studies have suggested that if mandated U.S. ethanol targets are met, the amount of nitrogen flowing down the [[Mississippi River]] and fueling the Gulf of Mexico dead zone may increase by 30 to 40 percent. The best alternative would be to forgo the production of ethanol from corn. If the country wants to rely on biofuels, it should instead grow grasses and trees and burn these to co-generate heat and electricity; nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be much lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howarth|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phosphorus ====
{{Further|Peak phosphorus}}
With regard to phosphorus, the ocean engineer David Vaccari says that the most sustainable environmental [[phosphorus cycle|flow of phosphorus]] "would be the natural flux: seven million metric tons per year (Mt/yr). To hit that mark yet satisfy our usage of 22 Mt/yr, we would have to recycle or reuse 72 percent of our phosphorus [...] The flow could be reduced with existing technologies... [lowering] the loss to waterways from 22 to 8.25 Mt/yr, not very much above the natural flux."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaccari|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peak phosphorus is a concept to describe the point in time at which the maximum global [[phosphorus]] production rate is reached. Phosphorus is a scarce finite resource on earth and means of production other than mining are unavailable because of its non-gaseous environmental cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neset|Cordell|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some researchers, Earth's phosphorus reserves are expected to be completely depleted in 50–100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cordell|Drangert|White|2009|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]

====Ocean acidification====
[[Ocean acidification|Surface ocean acidity]] has increased thirty percent since the industrial revolution. About one quarter of the additional carbon dioxide generated by humans is dissolved in the oceans, where it forms [[carbonic acid]]. This acidity inhibits the ability of corals, shellfish and plankton to build shells and skeletons. [[Cascade effect (ecology)|Knock-on effects]] could have serious consequences for [[fish stock]]s. This boundary is clearly interconnected with the climate change boundaries, since the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also the underlying control variable for the ocean acidification boundary.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The ocean chemist Peter Brewer thinks "ocean acidification has impacts other than simple changes in pH, and these may need boundaries too."&lt;ref name="Brewer 2009"/&gt;

The marine chemist Scott Doney thinks "the main tactics are raising energy efficiency, switching to renewable and nuclear power, protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies. Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification. The excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow, and as they die the added CO2 from their decay acidifies the water. We have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage ... Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks. More practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries. Larval mollusks such as clams and oysters appear to be more susceptible to acidification than adults, and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer pH and provide better substrate for larval attachment. The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will have to adapt. We can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing, making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doney|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land use====
[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|350px|right|Europe land use map. Human land uses include arable farmland (yellow) and pasture (light green)]]

Across the planet, forests, wetlands and other vegetation types are being converted to agricultural and other [[land use]]s, impacting freshwater, carbon and other cycles, and reducing biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The environment advisor Steve Bass says research tells us that "the sustainability of land use depends less on percentages and more on other factors. For example, the environmental impact of 15 per cent coverage by intensively farmed cropland in large blocks will be significantly different from that of 15 per cent of land farmed in more sustainable ways, integrated into the landscape. The boundary of 15 per cent land-use change is, in practice, a premature policy guideline that dilutes the authors' overall scientific proposition. Instead, the authors might want to consider a limit on soil degradation or soil loss. This would be a more valid and useful indicator of the state of terrestrial health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bass|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth systems scientist Eric Lambin thinks that "intensive agriculture should be concentrated on land that has the best potential for high-yield crops ... We can avoid losing the best agricultural land by controlling land degradation, freshwater depletion and urban sprawl. This step will require zoning and the adoption of more efficient agricultural practices, especially in developing countries. The need for farmland can be lessened, too, by decreasing waste along the food distribution chain, encouraging slower population growth, ensuring more equitable food distribution worldwide and significantly reducing meat consumption in rich countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lambin|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

====Freshwater====
[[File:PeakWaterAquifer.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Overexploitation of [[groundwater]] from an [[aquifer]] can result in a [[peak water]] curve.&lt;ref name="Palaniappan 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Palaniappan|Gleick|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Human pressures on global [[freshwater]] systems are having [[Water crisis|dramatic effects]]. The [[Water cycle|freshwater cycle]] is another boundary significantly affected by climate change.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt; Freshwater resources, such as lakes and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). [[Overexploitation]] occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer [[Overdrafting|depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html "Underlying Causes of Deforestation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |date=11 April 2001 }} UN Report.{{who|date=December 2011}}  &lt;!--  **This is a _web page_ that purports to be a UN report, but lacking any information as to where the original may be found.  This is NOT a relible source, and should be removed.** --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to [[peak oil|oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Sandford|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their overexploitation can result in a [[Hubbert peak|Hubbert-like peak]]. A modified [[Hubbert curve]] applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref name="Palaniappan 2008"/&gt;

The [[hydrologist]] [[Peter Gleick]] comments: "Few rational observers deny the need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries is the concept of [[peak water]]. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world's major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California's Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred ... The good news is that the potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gleick|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologist David Molden says "a global limit on water consumption is necessary, but the suggested planetary boundary of 4,000 cubic kilometres per year is too generous."&lt;ref name="Molden 2009"/&gt;

====Ozone depletion====
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}
[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|right|During 21–30 September 2006 the average area of the Antarctic ozone hole was the largest ever observed]]

The stratospheric [[ozone layer]] protectively filters [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) from the [[Sun]], which would otherwise damage biological systems. The actions taken after the [[Montreal Protocol]] appeared to be keeping the planet within a safe boundary.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt; However, in 2011, according to a paper published in ''Nature'', the boundary was unexpectedly [[Ozone depletion#Arctic ozone hole|pushed in the Arctic]]; "... the fraction of the Arctic vortex in March with total ozone less than 275 Dobson units (DU) is typically near zero, but reached nearly 45%".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Manney|Santee|27 others|2011|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel laureate in chemistry, [[Mario J. Molina|Mario Molina]], says "five per cent is a reasonable limit for acceptable ozone depletion, but it doesn't represent a tipping point".&lt;ref name="Molina 2009"/&gt;

The physicist David Fahey says that as a result of the Montreal Protocol "stratospheric ozone depletion will largely reverse by 2100. The gain has relied, in part, on intermediate substitutes, notably hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and the growing use of compounds that cause no depletion, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Ongoing success depends on several steps:
* "Continue observing the ozone layer to promptly reveal unexpected changes. Ensure that nations adhere to regulations; for example, the HCFC phaseout will not be complete until 2030.
* "Maintain the Scientific Assessment Panel under the protocol. It attributes causes of changes in the ozone layer and evaluates new chemicals for their potential to destroy ozone and contribute to climate change.
* "Maintain the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel. It provides information on technologies and substitute compounds that helps nations assess how the demand for applications such as refrigeration, air-conditioning and foam insulation can be met while protecting the ozone layer.
"The two panels will also have to evaluate climate change and ozone recovery together. Climate change affects ozone abundance by altering the chemical composition and dynamics of the stratosphere, and compounds such as HCFCs and HFCs are greenhouse gases. For example, the large projected demand for HFCs could significantly contribute to climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fahey|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atmospheric aerosols====
[[Aerosol]] particles in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence [[monsoon]] and global [[atmospheric circulation]] systems. Some aerosols produce clouds which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative [[radiative forcing]] (cooling influence).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} &lt;!-- Needs author, chapter, and section, with links. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide each year, aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths. Aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the planetary boundaries, but it is not yet clear whether an appropriate safe threshold measure can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockholm Resilience Centre|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

====Chemical pollution====
Some chemicals, such as [[persistent organic pollutants]], [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s and [[radionuclide]]s, have potentially irreversible [[Bioaccumulation|additive]] and synergic effects on biological organisms, reducing fertility and resulting in permanent [[genetic damage]].  Sublethal uptakes are drastically reducing marine bird and mammal populations. This boundary seems important, although it is hard to quantify.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

A Bayesian emulator for persistent organic pollutants has been developed which can potentially be used to quantify the boundaries for chemical pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoh|Kawai|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, critical exposure levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) above which mass mortality events of marine mammals are likely to occur, have been proposed as a chemical pollution planetary boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoh|Kawai|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction among boundaries==
A planetary boundary may interact in a manner that changes the safe operating level of other boundaries. Rockström ''et al.'' 2009 did not analyze such interactions, but they suggested that many of these interactions will reduce rather than expand the proposed boundary levels.

For example, the [[land use]] boundary could shift downward if the freshwater boundary is breached, causing lands to become arid and unavailable for agriculture. At a regional level, water resources may decline in Asia if [[deforestation]] continues in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]].  Such considerations suggest the need for "extreme caution in approaching or transgressing any individual planetary boundaries."&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

Another example has to do with [[coral reef]]s and [[marine ecosystem]]s. In 2009, {{Harvtxt|De'Ath|Lough|Fabricius|2009}} showed that, since 1990, calcification in the reefs of the [[Great Barrier Reef|Great Barrier]] that they examined decreased at a rate unprecedented over the last 400 years (14% in less than 20 years). Their evidence suggests that the increasing temperature stress and the declining ocean saturation state of [[aragonite]] is making it difficult for reef corals to deposit calcium carbonate. {{Harvtxt|Bellwood|others|2004}} explored how multiple stressors, such as increased nutrient loads and [[fishing pressure]], move corals into less desirable ecosystem states. {{Harvtxt|Guinotte|Fabry|2008}} showed that ocean acidification will significantly change the distribution and abundance of a whole range of marine life, particularly species "that build skeletons, shells, and tests of biogenic calcium carbonate. "Increasing temperatures, surface [[UV radiation]] levels and ocean acidity all stress marine [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], and the combination of these stresses may well cause perturbations in the abundance and diversity of marine biological systems that go well beyond the effects of a single stressor acting alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}, [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/appendix1.pdf Appendix 1. Supplementary Information].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
{{quote box
| quote = The concept of planetary boundaries challenges the belief that resources are either limitless or infinitely substitutable. It threatens the business-as-usual approach to economic growth. The fact that reference to planetary boundaries was excluded from the [ [[Rio+20]] ] conference statement is a counterintuitive sign that the concept is being taken very seriously and has indeed gained enough traction to be threatening to the status quo. Had planetary boundaries remained in the statement, the most credible interpretation is that they would join a growing list of nice-sounding goals that are included but never achieved in the end. Planetary boundaries will not go away. The intrinsic limits to the amount of resources and environmental services that humanity can extract safely from the Earth System cannot be eliminated by wishful thinking, denial, or omission from official sustainable development conference statements. It is simply the nature of the planet we inhabit.

===The doughnut===
In 2012 [[Kate Raworth]] from [[Oxfam]] noted the Rockstrom concept does not take [[human population growth]] into account.&lt;ref&gt;Raworth, Kate (2012) [http://www.oxfam.org.nz/resources/onlinereports/dp-a-safe-and-just-space-for-humanity-130212-en.pdf A safe and just space for humanity: Can we live within the doughnut?] Oxfam Discussion Paper, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested social boundaries should be incorporated into the planetary boundary structure, such as jobs, education, food, access to water, health services and energy and to accommodate an environmentally safe space compatible with [[poverty eradication]] and "rights for all". Within planetary limits and an equitable social foundation lies a doughnut shaped area which is the area where there is a "safe and just space for humanity to thrive in".&lt;ref name=ITIN&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95227/CLIMATE-CHANGE-Understanding-Rio-20 Climate change: Understanding Rio+20] UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, ''ITIN'', 3 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenth boundary===
In 2012, [[Steven Running]] suggested a tenth boundary, the annual net global [[primary production]] of all [[terrestrial plant]]s, as an easily determinable measure integrating many variables that will give "a clear signal about the health of ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;

===Not yet endorsed by United Nations ===
The United Nations secretary general [[Ban Ki-moon]] endorsed the concept of planetary boundaries on 16 March 2012, when he presented the key points of the report of his High Level Panel on Global Sustainability to an informal [[Plenary session|plenary]] of the UN General Assembly.&lt;ref name=ITIN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/science-and-innovation-policy/science-at-rio-20/news/rio-20-zero-draft-accepts-planetary-boundaries-.html Rio+20 zero draft accepts 'planetary boundaries'] ''SciDev.Net'', 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ban stated: "The Panel’s vision is to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, to make growth inclusive and production and consumption more sustainable, while combating climate change and respecting a range of other planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sgsm14166.doc.htm Secretary-General Highlights Key Points...] ''United Nations News'', 16 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was incorporated into the so-called "zero draft" of the outcome of the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] to be convened in Rio de Janeiro 20–22 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/content/documents/370The%20Future%20We%20Want%2010Jan%20clean%20_no%20brackets.pdf Zero draft of the outcome document] RIO+20, United Nations Conference on Sustainability Development.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the concept was subsequently withdrawn from the text of the conference, "partly due to concerns from some poorer countries that its adoption could lead to the sidelining of poverty reduction and economic development. It is also, say observers, because the idea is simply too new to be officially adopted, and needed to be challenged, weathered and chewed over to test its robustness before standing a chance of being internationally accepted at UN negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/features/your-guide-to-science-and-technology-at-rio-20-1.html Your guide to science and technology at Rio+20] ''scidev.net'', 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that three of the boundaries (including climate change) might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed; these also strongly influence the remaining boundaries. In the paper, the framework is developed to make it more applicable at the regional scale.

===Agricultural and nutritional impacts===
[[File:Planetary boundaries of agriculture and nutrition.png|thumb|400px|Environmental impacts of agriculture and nutrition within the framework of planetary boundaries according to Meier (2017)&lt;ref name="Meier 2017"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meier|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Human activities related to agriculture and nutrition globally contribute to the transgression of four out of nine planetary boundaries. Surplus nutrient flows (N, P) into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are of highest importance, followed by excessive land-system change and biodiversity loss. Whereas in the case of biodiversity loss, P cycle and land-system change, the transgression is in the zone of uncertainty—indicating an increasing risk (yellow circle in the figure), the N boundary related to agriculture is more than 200% transgressed—indicating a high risk (red marked circle in the figure).&lt;ref name="Meier 2017"/&gt;

'''''Poa pratensis''''', commonly known as '''Kentucky bluegrass''' (or '''blue grass'''), '''smooth meadow-grass''', or '''common meadow-grass''', is a [[perennial]] species of [[Poaceae|grass]] native to practically all of Europe, northern Asia and the mountains of Algeria and Morocco. Although the species is spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the U.S., it is not native to North America. The Spanish brought the seeds of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/turf/publications/Bluegrass.html|title=Kentucky Bluegrass |publisher=Aggie Horticulture|author=Martin Anderson, Texas AgriLife Extension Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poa pratensis'' forms a valuable pasture plant, characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil. It is also used for making [[lawn]]s in parks and gardens and is common in cool moist climates like the northeastern United States. When found on native grasslands in Canada, however, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ksenija Vujnovic |author2=Ross W. Wein |date=September 1997 |title=An Inventory of Remnant Prairie Grasslands Within the Central Parkland Natural Sub-Region of Alberta |url=https://www.albertaparks.ca/media/3195225/parkland_report_remnant_prairie.pdf |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
''Poa pratensis'' was one of the many species described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his landmark work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753. ''Poa'' is [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] for [[fodder]] and ''pratensis'' is derived from ''pratum'', the [[Latin]] for [[meadow]]. The name Kentucky bluegrass derives from its flower heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm|-1|abbr=in|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dag Ryen (letter to the editor) |date=June 3, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/opinion/l-what-makes-kentucky-s-bluegrass-blue-528593.html |title=What Makes Kentucky's Bluegrass Blue |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=22 |accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Poa pratensis'' is the [[type (botany)|type species]] of the grass family [[Poaceae]].

There are two ill-defined subspecies:
*''Poa pratensis'' [[ssp.]] ''pratensis'' – temperate regions
*''Poa pratensis'' ssp. ''colpodea'' – Arctic

==Description==
''Poa pratensis'' is a [[herbaceous]] perennial plant {{convert|30|–|70|cm}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] have boat-shaped tips, narrowly linear, up to {{convert|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|3|–|5|mm}} broad, smooth or slightly roughened, with a rounded to truncate ligule {{convert|1|–|2|mm}} long. The conical [[panicle]] is {{convert|5|–|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long, with 3 to 5 branches in the basal whorls; the oval [[spikelet]]s are {{convert|3|–|6|mm}} long with 2 to 5 [[floret]]s, and are purplish-green or grey. They are in flower from May to July, compared to annual meadowgrass (''[[Poa annua]]'') which is in flower for eight months of the year. ''Poa pratensis'' has a fairly prominent mid-vein (center of the blade).

The [[ligule]] is extremely short and square ended, making a contrast with annual meadowgrass (''[[Poa annua]]'') and rough meadowgrass (''[[Poa trivialis]]'') in which it is silvery and pointed. The Kentucky bluegrass is a dark green/blue compared to the apple-green color of ''Poa annua'' and ''Poa trivialis''.

The [[rootstock]] is creeping, with runners ([[rhizome]]s). The broad, blunt leaves tend to spread at the base, forming close mats.

==Ecology==
[[File:PP Na Popovickem kopci 007 cf Myrmus miriformis.jpg|thumb|''[[Myrmus miriformis]]'' in the [[Olomouc Region]]]]
This species is among the food plants of the caterpillars of the [[meadow brown]] (''Maniola jurtina'') and [[Gatekeeper (butterfly)|gatekeeper]] (''Pyronia tithonus'') butterflies; the common sun beetle (''[[Amara aenea]]'') (adults feed on the developing seeds), ''Eupelix cuspidata'' of the [[leafhopper]] family, and ''[[Myrmus miriformis]]'', a grassbug (feeds on young blades and developing seeds).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o1084-roughmeadowgrass.php Natural England description on website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223215305/http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o1084-roughmeadowgrass.php |date=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation and production==
Since the 1950s and early 1960s, 90% of Kentucky bluegrass seed in the United States has been produced on specialist farms in [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

During the 1990s botanists began experimenting with hybrids of ''Poa pratensis'' and Texas bluegrass (''[[Poa arachnifera|P. arachnifera]]''), with the goal of creating a [[drought]] and heat-resistant lawn grass.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12585">The '''Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board report on mass surveillance''' was issued in January 2014 in light of the [[global surveillance disclosures of 2013]], recommending the US end bulk data collection.&lt;ref name="accessnow1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/01/23/us-privacy-oversight-board-slams-legality-usefulness-bulk-data-collection |title=US privacy oversight board slams legality &amp; usefulness bulk data collection |publisher=Accessnow.org |date=January 23, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |author1=Micek, Peter |author2=Ben-Avie, Jochai |author3=Fox, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCLOB /&gt;

==Background==
The [[Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board]] was first chartered under the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title I - Reform of the Intelligence Community|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/108-796/titlei_reform_intel.pdf|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|accessdate=December 5, 2012|date=December 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the board is to provide advice and review of whether adequate supervision, guidelines, and oversight exist and to "continually review" regulations, policies, procedures, and information sharing practices to ensure privacy and civil liberties considerations are protected.&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Roger Z.|author2=Robert D. Kline|title=Intelligence and the National Security Strategist|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2005|page=572|isbn=978-0-7425-4039-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To carry out these roles, the board does not have [[subpoena]] power, but is able to request subpoenas subject to the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s discretion "to protect sensitive law enforcement or counterterrorism information or ongoing operations."  The [[U.S. Director of National Intelligence]] also has the power to override requests "to protect the national security interests of the United States"&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;

A report by former members of the [[9/11 commission]] in December 2005 noted there was "little urgency" in creation of the board, whose first meeting was in 2006.&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;  It was initially composed of a chair, vice chair, and three other members.  As these members served at the pleasure of the President, "Critics... maintained that the board appeared to be a presidential appendage, devoid of the capability to exercise independent judgment and assessment or to provide impartial findings and recommendations", according to the [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;ref name="Hatch2011" /&gt;  Subsequently member Lanny Davis resigned in protest over the board's lack of independence, citing "extensive redlining by Administration officials of the board's first report to Congress" that was accepted by the other members.&lt;ref name=Hatch2011&gt;{{citation |title=Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board: New Independent Agency Status |author=Garrett Hatch |date=November 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34385.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The board was then reconstituted under the [[Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007]] (H.R. 1), beginning in January 2008, as an independent agency with appointments subject to [[Senate confirmation]].  Four members of the board were nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2011, and confirmed by the Senate in August 2012.&lt;ref name=Hatch2011 /&gt;  Board chairman David Medine was finally confirmed in May 2013 in the wake of the Snowden disclosures in a party-line vote with 53 Democrats supporting and 45 Republicans opposing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivepunch.org/vote.htm?vote=2347201&amp;topic=R10|title = On the nomination of David Medine as chairman of the federal Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board: Senate Roll Call 114|publisher=ProgressivePunch|date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global surveillance disclosures==
{{main|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}
The Board's report follows a series of highly publicized leaks about the operations of the [[global surveillance]] program conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] in the United States working with a number of other countries (see [[Five Eyes]]).  While the program's nominal focus was on foreign nationals, the disclosures also revealed the large-scale surveillance of communications by United States citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Barton Gellman]]|title=Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission’s accomplished|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html|date=December 24, 2013|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These leaks were largely the work of [[Edward Snowden]], a [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] employee with access to a wide range of [[top secret]] documents.  Publications of the documents by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' began in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order|work=The Guardian|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report==

On January 23, 2014, the board released its report,&lt;ref name=PCLOB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1008957/final-report.pdf|title=Report on the Telephone Records Program Conducted under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and on the Operations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|publisher=Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommending the US end bulk data collection.&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Watchdog Report Says N.S.A.

But there would be no storehouse, private or public, of telephone data beyond what the phone companies keep in the course of their normal business activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US government privacy board says NSA bulk collection of phone data is illegal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/nsa-barack-obama-phone-data-collection-illegal-privacy-board|accessdate=March 3, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 23, 2014|author=Spencer Ackerman and Dan Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report concluded that the program "lacks a viable legal foundation".&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer Ackerman in Washington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/us-privacy-boards-dissenters-nsa-surveillance-balance |title=US privacy board dissenters defend balancing act of NSA surveillance &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=January 23, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It concluded "we see little evidence that the unique capabilities provided by the NSA's bulk collection of telephone records actually have yielded material counterterrorism results that could not have been achieved without the NSA's Section 215 program."&lt;ref name="slate1"&gt; {{cite web|last=Abdo |first=Alex |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/01/24/pclob_nsa_surveillance_report_three_things_you_need_to_know.html |title=PCLOB NSA surveillance report: Three things you need to know |publisher=Slate.com |date=January 24, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded: “Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government’s efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|title=Independent review board says NSA phone data program is illegal and should end|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/independent-review-board-says-nsa-phone-data-program-is-illegal-and-should-end/2014/01/22/4cebd470-83dd-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9_story.html|accessdate=March 3, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report called for a "Special Advocate" to be involved in some cases before the FISA court judge.&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt; The Board also contained the recommendation to release future and past FISC decisions “that involve novel interpretations of FISA or other significant questions of law, technology or compliance.”&lt;ref name="accessnow1"/&gt;

The report also recommended against an alternate proposal, which President [[Barack Obama]] had ordered Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] to formulate within 60 days, which would force third parties including telephone companies to conduct data retention.  The panel's majority spokesman said this was due to cost and legal exposure for the companies involved, and that it was not an "easy out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-23/nsa-phone-data-program-called-illegal-by-privacy-oversight-board|title=NSA’s Spying on Phone Calls Illegal: U.S. Privacy Board|publisher=Bloomsburg News|author=Margaret Talev and Chris Strohm|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCLOB /&gt;

==Reactions==
Sen. [[Ron Wyden]], a senior member of the intelligence committee and long-time critic of the programs, released a statement in reaction to the report. Said Wyden: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The privacy board's findings closely mirror many of the criticisms made by surveillance reform advocates. The bulk collection program was built on a murky legal foundation that raises many constitutional questions and has been proven to be an ineffective tool for collecting unique intelligence information. Moreover, as the board wrote in its report, a program where the government collects the telephone records of millions of law-abiding Americans 'fundamentally shifts the balance of power between the state and its citizens.' The board goes on to say that with the government's 'powers of compulsion and criminal prosecution,' collection of data on its own citizens 'poses unique threats to privacy,' and is expected to have a 'chilling effect on the free exercise of speech and association.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Albany Tribune |url=http://www.albanytribune.com/23012014-wyden-statement-pclob-report-bulk-collection-phone-records/ |title=Wyden Statement On PCLOB Report On Bulk Collection Of Phone Records |publisher=Albanytribune.com |date=January 23, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Asked by [[Patrick Mächler]] to what extent the report will have an impact, [[Edward Snowden]] stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t see how Congress could ignore it, as it makes it clear there is no reason at all to maintain the 215 program. Let me quote from the official report:

“Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government’s efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.freesnowden.is/asksnowden/ |title=Live Q&amp;A with Edward Snowden |last=Snowden |first=Edward |date=January 23, 2014 |publisher=Courage Foundation |accessdate=January 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124015739/http://www.freesnowden.is/asksnowden/ |archivedate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''pulse vaccination strategy''' is a method used to eradicate an epidemic by repeatedly vaccinating a group at risk, over a defined age range, until the spread of the pathogen has been stopped. It is most commonly used during measles and polio epidemics to quickly stop the spread and contain the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;Nokes, DJ., Swinton, J.

Vaccination in pulses: a strategy for global eradication of measles and polio?Trends Microbiol. 1997 Jan;5(1):14-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical model ==
Where T= time units is a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects vaccinated in a relatively short time. This yields the differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects as
:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N  - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S, S(n T^+) = (1-p) S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = - \mu V,   V(n T^+) = V(n T^-) + p S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Further, by setting {{math|1=''I'' = 0}}, one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Shulgin, BV., Stone L., Agur, Z. Pulse vaccination strategy in the SIR epidemic model. Bull Math Biol. 1998 Nov;60(6):1123-1148.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; S^*(t) = 1- \frac{p}{1-(1-p)E^{-\mu T}}E^{-\mu MOD(t,T)}  &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">A '''reception report''' is a means by which radio stations (usually [[shortwave|short-]] and [[Medium frequency|medium-wave]] broadcasters) receive detailed feedback from their listeners about the quality and content of their broadcasts. A reception report consists of several pieces of information which help the station verify that the report confirms coverage of their transmission, and usually include the following information:

*Date, time and frequency (in [[Hertz|kHz]]) of the transmission
*Station name
*Description of the [[interval signal]], if heard
*Programme details
*Name of announcers or programme host, if heard
*Details of the overall signal quality (normally using the [[SINPO]] code)

The listener's location relative to the station is also useful; this indicates how well the station's [[transmitter]] is performing and in which direction(s) its antenna is beaming the signal. The station also evaluates a reception report in light of the listener's [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] and antenna. Upon receipt of a correct report, a broadcaster sometimes issues a letter or [[postcard]] (known as a [[QSL card]]) to the sender, thanking them and confirming that the details are correct.  "QSL" is part of the [[amateur radio]] [[Q code]], meaning "I acknowledge receipt". One aspect of [[DXing]] is collecting QSL cards and letters from stations heard (similar to a [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher's]] "life list"). QSLing a radio station involves writing an accurate reception report, mailing it to the station and awaiting a reply. Since QSLing is a voluntary act on the station's part, several techniques are used to improve a listener's success rate.

==Useful reception reports==
Station engineers and other personnel are primarily interested in whether or not their station is heard, and how well; therefore, a complete and accurate reception report (whether by postal or e-mail) is generally appreciated. To begin, report the frequency, date and time the station was heard. For medium-wave (AM) stations, the time should be that of the [[time zone]] in which the station is located. Thus, if a listener hears stations from the [[Eastern time zone]] of North America (such as Ontario and New York), [[Standard time|EST]] or [[Daylight saving time|EDT]] should be given (depending on the time of year). Stations in the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central time zone]] (such as [[Chicago]]) use CST or CDT, which is one hour earlier than Eastern time. If a listener is uncertain of the time zone, they should clearly indicate their local time or even better use [[UTC]]

It is helpful to jot down programming as it is heard. Useful details include:

*[[Station identification]]
*Program name
*Names of station announcers (such as a [[talk show]] host)
*Commercials (good indicators, because the station keeps a [[logbook]] of commercials
*Names of [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|network programs]], such as "[[CNN]] News" or "[[The Sports Network|TSN Sports]]"

The purpose of providing this information is to prove to the station that you heard their program and not that of another station. The more detail a listener can provide, the better the chance of eliciting a QSL. Include information, also, about how well the signal was received. For medium-wave reports, an indication of signal strength and any interference ([[Co-channel interference|co-]] or [[adjacent-channel interference]], with identity of interfering station if possible) is usually sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-guide-reception-reports-quick.html Quick Guide to Reception Reports]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531172957/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-guide-reception-reports-quick.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International shortwave broadcasters are familiar with the [[SINPO]] code:

*'''S'''ignal strength
*'''I'''nterference (includes human-generated noise—for example, power-line hum)
*'''N'''oise ("white [[Noise (radio)|noise"]], or thunderstorm static)
*'''P'''ropagation disturbance ([[fading]])
*'''O'''verall reception quality

Each letter receives a value between 5 and 1, where 5 is the best and 1 the worst. Many shortwave listeners (known as "program listeners") desire nothing more than music and news from a broadcaster; however, for DXers a QSL collection is tangible proof of what they have heard. Some listeners use pre-printed forms if they are unfamiliar with the language spoken by station personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Writing Useful Reception Reports http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531154511/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While major international broadcasters have not required return postage for a QSL, the growing popularity of e-mailed reception reports and e-QSLs has largely eliminated the necessity for [[international reply coupon]]s (IRCs), [[mint stamp]]s from the verifying station's country or "green stamps" (US dollar bills).

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945–1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcphail |first1=Thomas L. |title=Global Communication Theories, stakeholders, and Trends |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Communication.html?id=MAco-KZGZNIC|isbn=9781444358100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological development===
The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# world population explosion

# from [[geopolitics]] to [[Gaia philosophy|gaiapolitics]]

# increased [[cross-cultural communication]]
# changing concept of community
# greater [[Centralisation|centralization of control]]
# information explosion
# changes in technologies
# greater dependence on global communication
# greater [[interdependence]] and democracy
# impact of communication on peace and war

== Theoretical approaches and perspectives ==

=== Transcultural political economy ===

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system. 
&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty, P. &amp; Zhao, Y. (2008). Global Communications: toward a transcultural political economy. Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2–74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, D. (1958). The passing of traditional society: Modernising the Middle East. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Saïd's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Göteborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Département des études|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists Frӧbel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst |first=D. |last2=Kim |first2=L. |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the Universalism–Particularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481–498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan’ s famous words, a ‘‘global village.’’&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the world’ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134–155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297–327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
[[Image:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|left|US Army operating Renault FT tanks]]

As the American army did not have tanks of its own, the French two-man [[Renault FT]] Light Tank was used by US in the later stages of [[World War I]]. It was cheap and well-suited for mass production, and in addition to its traversable turret another innovative feature of the FT was its engine located at the rear. This pattern, with the gun located in a mounted turret and rear engine, became the standard for most succeeding tanks across the world even to this day.

The '''M1917''' was a US tank accepted by the army in October 1918 and is primarily based on the plans of the French [[Renault FT]]. The crew, a driver and gunner, were separated from the engine by a bulkhead. Steel idler wheels replaced the wooden idlers fitted to French examples. Approximately 64 of the M1917 were built before the end of World War I and 10 were sent to Europe, but too late to be used in combat. After the war Van Dorn Iron Works, the Maxwell Motor Company, and the C.L. Best Tractor Company created 950 more. 374 had cannons and 526 had machine guns and 50 were signal (radio) tanks. A later modification, the M1917A1, was a lengthened, rebuilt, updated version compared to the French one, having a 100&amp;nbsp;hp Franklin engine and an electric self-starter rather than a crank starter.&lt;ref&gt;The Renault FT Light Tank; S. Zaloga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treat 'Em Rough! Capt. Dale E. Wilson&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. troops also used the British Heavy Tanks Mk V and Mk V* (pronounced "Mark Five" and "Mark Five Star"). A battalion trained in England and saw action in France in the last six weeks of the War. On a small number of occasions, U.S. troops were supported by tank units of the French Army operating [[Schneider CA1|Schneider]] and [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] machines.

====World War II====
[[Marmon-Herrington CTLS|Marmon-Herrington tanks]] that could not be delivered because of the fall of the Dutch East Indies were taken over by the US. The CTLS-4TAC and -4TAY tanks were redesignated Light Tank T14 and T16 respectively. They were used for training, some were used in Alaska and by the US Marines. The CTLS-4TAC has the turret offset to the left, the CTLS-4TAY to the right.

===M3/5 Stuart===
====World War II====
[[File:M3-Stuart-Fort-Knox-3.jpg|thumb|right|M3 Stuart at Fort Knox, Kentucky, used for training.]]
The [[M3 Stuart|Stuart]] was an upgrade of the [[M2 Light Tank]].

The initial upgrade was designated the M3 Stuart and had thicker [[vehicle armour|armor]], modified suspension and a 37mm&amp;nbsp;mm gun. Production of the M3 and later the M5 Stuart started in March 1941 and continued until October 1943 with a total of 25,000 produced.

An upgrade of the M3, which was initially called M4 but later redesignated the M5, was developed with improved engines and produced through 1942. The M5 featured a redesigned hull and driver's hatches moved to the top. The M5 gradually replaced the M3 in production from 1942 and was in turn succeeded by the [[M24 Chaffee|Light Tank M24]] in 1944.

The [[British Army]] was the first to use the M3 in combat. In November 1941, some 170 Stuarts took part in [[Operation Crusader]], with poor results.

Although the high losses suffered by Stuart-equipped units during the operation had more to do with better tactics and training of the enemy than superiority of enemy tanks in the [[North African campaign]], the operation revealed that the M3 had several technical faults. Mentioned in the British complaints were the 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun, a limited range and poor internal layout. The two-man turret crew was a significant weakness, and some British units tried to fight with three-man turret crews. Crews liked its high speed and mechanical reliability.

From the summer of 1942, when enough US medium tanks had been received, the British usually kept Stuarts out of tank-to-tank combat. M3s, M3A3s, and M5s continued in British service until the end of the war, but British armor units had a smaller proportion of these light tanks than US units.

The other major [[Lend-Lease]] recipient of the M3, the [[Soviet Union]], was even less happy with the tank, considering it undergunned, underarmored, likely to catch fire, and too sensitive to fuel quality. The narrow tracks were highly unsuited to operation in winter conditions, as they resulted in high ground pressures that sunk the tank. However, the Stuart was superior to early-war Soviet light tanks such as the [[T-60]], which were often underpowered and possessed even lighter armament than the Stuart. In 1943, the [[Red Army]] tried out the M5 and decided that the upgraded design wasn't much better than the M3. Being less desperate than in 1941, the Soviets turned down an American offer to supply the M5. M3s continued in Red Army service at least until 1944.

In [[United States Army|US Army]] service, the M3 first saw combat in the Philippines. Two battalions, comprising the Provisional Tank Group fought in the Bataan peninsula campaign. When the American army joined the [[North African Campaign]] in late 1942, Stuart units still formed a large part of its armor strength.

After the disastrous [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] the US quickly disbanding most of their light tank [[battalion]]s and subordinating the Stuarts to medium tank battalions performing the traditional cavalry missions of scouting and screening. For the rest of the war, most US tank battalions had three [[company (military unit)|companies]] of [[M4 Sherman]]s and one company of M3s or M5/M5A1s.

In the European theater, Allied light tanks had to be given cavalry and infantry fire support roles since their main cannon armament could not compete with heavier enemy AFVs. However, the Stuart was still effective in combat in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]], as [[List of Japanese armoured fighting vehicles of World War II|Japanese tanks]] were both relatively rare and were generally much weaker than even Allied light tanks. [[Imperial Japanese Army#The Second World War|Japanese infantrymen]] were poorly equipped with [[anti-tank]] weapons and tended to attack tanks using close-assault tactics. In this environment, the Stuart was only moderately more vulnerable than medium tanks. In addition, the poor terrain and roads common to the theatre were unsuitable for the much heavier M4 medium tanks, and so initially, only light armor could be deployed. Heavier M4s were eventually brought to overcome heavily entrenched positions, though the Stuart continued to serve in a combat capacity until the end of the war.

The US liquidated its Stuarts when it got sufficient numbers of [[M24 Chaffee]]s but the tank remained in service until the end of the war and well after. In addition to the United States, United Kingdom and Soviet Union, who were the primary users, it was also used by [[France]] and [[China]].

===M24 Chaffee===
====World War II====
[[File:M-24 Chaffee Light Tank 01.jpg|thumb|right|M24 Chaffee on display]]
In April 1943 the government started work on the M24 Chaffee, designated '''Light Tank T24''' as a replacement for the [[Stuart tank|M3/M5 Stuart]] after the original replacement, the M7, was rejected in March. Every effort was made to keep the weight of the vehicle under 20 tons. The [[vehicle armour|armor]] was kept light, and a lightweight 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun was developed. The design also featured wider tracks and [[torsion bar]] suspension. It had relatively low silhouette and a three-man turret. In mid-October the first pilot vehicle was delivered and production began in 1944 under the designation '''Light Tank M24'''. 4,730 were produced by the time production was stopped in August 1945.

The first thirty-four M24s reached Europe in November 1944 and were issued to the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized) in France. These were then issued to F Company, 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion and F Company, 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion which each received seventeen M24s. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944, these units and their new tanks were rushed to the southern sector; two of the M24s were detached to serve with the 740th Tank [[Battalion]] of the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]].

The M24 started to enter widespread issue in December 1944 but they were slow in reaching the front-line combat units. By the end of the war many armored divisions were still mainly equipped with the M5. Some armored divisions did not receive their first M24s until the war was over.

Reports were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75&amp;nbsp;mm main gun, as a vast improvement over the 37&amp;nbsp;mm. The M24 was still not up to the challenge of fighting tanks, however, the bigger gun at least gave it a chance to defend itself. Its light armor made it vulnerable in tank vs. tank actions.

The M24s contribution to winning the war was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the M5s of the armored divisions.

==Medium tanks==
===M4 Sherman===
[[File:Armoured Ramp Carrier.jpg|thumb|right|Sherman tank using a Churchill 'Ark' armored ramp carrier]]

====World War II====
The U.S. Army designed the M4 as a replacement for the [[M3 Lee|M3 Medium]]. The designated goals were to produce a fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank currently in use by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis nations]]. In April 1941 the U.S. Armored Force Board chose the simplest of five designs. Known as the T6, the design was a modified M3 hull and chassis, carrying a newly designed turret mounting the Lee's main gun. This became the Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/index.html AFV database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype M4 was completed in September 1941. The T6 became standardized as the M4, and production after modifications began in October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/article/ah20050729b Opening Salvo: M4A1 Sherman Tank by Michael J. Canavan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Army had seven main sub-designations for M4 variants during the production period: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, M4A5, and M4A6. These designations were manufactured concurrently at different locations.

While most Shermans ran on gasoline, the M4A2 and M4A6 had diesel engines: the M4A2 with a pair of [[General Motors|GMC]] 6-71 straight six engines,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, Thomas. ''Standard Catalog of U.S. Military Vehicles'' (Krause Publications, 1993), pp.192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; the M4A6 a [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] RD1820 [[Radial engine#Diesel radials|radial]].&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, pp.192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; These, plus the M4A4 which used the [[Chrysler A57 multibank]] engine, were mostly supplied to Allied countries under Lend-Lease.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, pp.190 &amp; 192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; "M4" can refer specifically to the initial sub-type with its Continental radial engine, or generically, to the entire family of seven Sherman sub-types, depending on context. Many details of production, shape, strength, and performance improved throughout production without a change to the tank's basic model number; more durable suspension units, safer "wet" (W) ammunition stowage, and stronger armor arrangements, such as the M4 Composite, which had a cast front hull section mated to a welded rear hull. British nomenclature differed from that employed by the U.S.

Early Shermans mounted a [[75 mm Gun (US)|75&amp;nbsp;mm medium-velocity general-purpose gun]]. Although Ordnance began work on the [[T20 Medium Tank|Medium Tank T20]] as a Sherman replacement, ultimately the Army decided to minimize production disruption by incorporating elements of other tank designs into Sherman production. Later M4A1, M4A2, and M4A3 models received the larger T23 turret, with a high-velocity [[76 mm gun M1]], which reduced the number of HE and smoke rounds carried and increased the number of anti-tank rounds. Later, the M4 and M4A3 were factory-produced with a 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer and a new distinctive [[mantlet]] in the original turret. The first standard-production 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun Sherman was an M4A1, accepted in January 1944, and the first standard-production 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer Sherman was an M4 accepted in February 1944.

In June–July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 ''Jumbo'' Shermans, which had very thick armor, and the 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun in a new, heavier T23-style turret, in order to assault fortifications. The M4A3 was the first to be factory-produced with the HVSS (horizontal volute spring suspension) suspension with wider tracks to distribute weight, and the smooth ride of the HVSS with its experimental E8 designation led to the nickname ''Easy Eight'' for Shermans so equipped. Both the Americans and the British developed a wide array of special attachments for the Sherman; few saw combat, and most remained experimental. Those which saw action included the bulldozer blade for Sherman [[Combat engineering vehicle|dozer tanks]], [[Duplex Drive]] for "swimming" Sherman tanks, R3 flame thrower for ''Zippo'' [[flame tank]]s, and the [[T34 Calliope|T34 60-tube ''Calliope'' 4.5" rocket launcher]] for the Sherman turret. The British variants (DD's and mine flails) were among "[[Hobart's Funnies]]," named after their commander, [[Percy Hobart]] of the [[79th Armoured Division]]. [[Image:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|right|A M4A3R3 used by the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]].]]

The M4 Sherman's basic chassis was used for all the sundry roles of a modern mechanized force: roughly 50,000 Sherman tanks, plus thousands more derivative vehicles under different model numbers. These included M32 and M74 "tow truck"-style [[armoured recovery vehicle|recovery tanks]] with winches, booms, and an 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortar for smoke screens; M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) [[artillery tractor|artillery prime movers]]; [[M7 Priest|M7B1]], [[M12 Gun Motor Carriage|M12]], [[M40 GMC|M40, and M43]] self-propelled artillery; and the [[M10 Wolverine|M10]] and [[M36 Jackson|M36]] tank destroyers.

The M4 Sherman served with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] during World War II. The U.S. also supplied large numbers to the various [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] countries. Shermans were used during the war by British and Commonwealth armies, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]], [[Free France|Free French]] forces, the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Polish Armed Forces in the West#Army|army in exile]], [[China]]'s [[National Revolutionary Army]], and [[Brazil]]'s  [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|Expeditionary Force]].

The U.S. Marine Corps used the diesel M4A2 and gasoline-powered M4A3 in the Pacific. However, the Chief of the Army's Armored Force, Lt. Gen. [[Jacob L. Devers]], ordered that no diesel-engined Sherman tanks be used by the Army outside the Zone of Interior (the continental U.S.). The U.S. Army used all types for either training or testing within the United States, but intended the M4A2 and M4A4 to be the primary [[Lend-Lease]] exports.

The M4A1 Sherman first saw combat at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in October 1942 with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]]. The first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4A1s in [[Operation Torch|Operation ''Torch'']] the next month. At this time, Shermans successfully engaged German Panzer IIIs with long barreled 50mm L60 guns, and Panzer IVs with short barreled 75&amp;nbsp;mm L24 guns. Additional M4 and M4A1s replaced M3 Lees in U.S. tank battalions over the course of the North African campaigns. However, by June 1944, most German tanks were up-gunned and 75&amp;nbsp;mm Shermans were outgunned. The M4 and M4A1 were the main types in U.S. units until late 1944, when the Army began replacing them with the preferred M4A3 with its more powerful {{Convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} engine. Some M4s and M4A1s continued in U.S. service for the rest of the war.

The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun (July 1944) was the M4A1, closely followed by the M4A3. By the end of the war, half the U.S. Army Shermans in Europe had the 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun. The first HVSS Sherman to see combat was the M4A3E8(76)W in December 1944. The M4A3E8 (76)W was arguably the best of the US Sherman tanks.

'''Targeting''', a commonly used technique in [[international health]] and [[public health]], develops a specialized health intervention approach for a specific group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Skinner, C. S. (2000). Tailoring: what's in a name? Health Education Research, 15(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Wray, R. J. (2003). Tailored and targeted health communication: Strategies for enhancing information relevance. American Journal of Health Behavior, 27 (suppl 3), S227-S232.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of people may be identified by various factors, including geography, race/ethnicity, age, health issues, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K. &amp; Kreuter, M .W. (2006). Advancing tailored Health communication: A persuasion and message effects perspective. Journal of Communication, 56, s184-s201.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account characteristics the group members share in common, only one version of program materials is used in a targeted health intervention and the intervention materials show features that the targeted population subgroup members prefer.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W., Lukwago, S. N., Bucholtz, D. C., Clark, E. M., &amp; Sanders-Thompson, V. (2002). Achieving cultural appropriateness in health promotion programs: Targeted and tailored approaches. Health Education and Behavior, 30(2), 133-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of targeting was adapted from [[marketing]]. Target marketing tries to define a subgroup of people with shared characteristics (such as liking of certain product features) as the right group of consumers for a particular product or service. Adopting the same principle, targeted health interventions identify a group of people who are particular vulnerable to certain health risks, intervene to address their health risks and in turn, improve their health. 
From early to mid-1980s, most health information was mass-produced for undifferentiated audience in the form of brochures, pamphlets, and booklets.&lt;ref&gt;. Rimer, B. K. &amp; Kreuter, M .W. (2006). Advancing tailored Health communication: A persuasion and message effects perspective. Journal of Communication, 56, s184-s201.&lt;/ref&gt; As people are increasingly aware of different characteristics within mass audiences, behavioral scientists began to develop different versions of materials for diverse population subgroups in order for health campaigns to be cost effective while still reaching large number of audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., &amp; Glassman, B. (1998). Tailoring communications for primary care settings.Methods of Information in Medicine, 37(2), 171–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M., &amp; Flora, J. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have suggested that compared to generic interventions which do not take into consideration the audience characteristics, targeting strategy can be more effective for health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M., Strecher,V., Glassman, B. (1999). One size does not fit all: The case for tailoring print materials. Annual Behavioral Medicine, 21, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience factors==
Targeting as an intervention strategy is now widely used in the health fields and has been found to help promote behavioral change.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M., Strecher,V., Glassman, B. (1999). One size does not fit all: The case for tailoring print materials. Annual Behavioral Medicine, 21, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The level of audience specificity in targeting can vary significantly, ranging from one single broad factor (e.g. interventions targeting women), to combined factors. For example, Gomez, Tan, Keegan, and Clarke (2007) identified South Asians in the U.S. who were less than age 50 and were unemployed or non-citizens as potential population subgroup for targeted mammogram utilization intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, S. L., Tan, S., Keegan, T. HM., &amp; Clarke, C. A. (2007). Disparities in mammographic screening for Asian women in California: A cross-sectional analysis to identify meaningful groups for targeted intervention. BMC Cancer, 7, 201-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Targeted health interventions have adopted different audience factors, including age (e.g. older smokers&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., Orleans, C. T., Fleischer, L., Cristinzio, S., Resch, N., Telepchak, J., et al. (1994). Does tailoring matter? The impact of a tailored guide on ratings and short-term smoking-related outcomes for older smokers. Health Education Research, Theory and Practice, 9(1), 69–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, G. D., Noll, E. l., Orleans, C. T., Rimer, B. K., Amfoh, K. &amp; Bonney, G. (1996). Reaching mid-life and older smokers: tailored interventions for routine medical care. Preventive medicine, 25, 346-354.&lt;/ref&gt;), race/ethnicity (e.g. African-Americans&lt;ref&gt;James, S.A., Jamjoum, L., Raghunathan, T.E., Strogatz, D.S., Furth, E.D., &amp; Khazanie, P.G. (1998). Physical activity and NIDDM in African-Americans. The Pitt County Study. Diabetes Care, 21(4), 555–562.&lt;/ref&gt;), socioeconomic status (e.g. low-income women&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, T.

Health Psychology, 20(4), 256-266.&lt;/ref&gt;), professions (e.g. health providers&lt;ref&gt;Mandelblatt, J. S. &amp; Yabroff, K. R. (1999). Effectiveness of interventions designed to increase mammography use: A meta-analysis of provider-targeted strategies. Cancer epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, 8, 759-767.&lt;/ref&gt;), health status (e.g. pregnant women and women with children,&lt;ref&gt;Keintz, M. K., Fleisher, L., &amp; Rimer, B. K. (1994). Reaching mothers of preschool-agedchildren with a targeted quit smoking intervention. Journal of Community Health, 19(1),25–40.&lt;/ref&gt; sensation-seeking adolescents&lt;ref&gt;Palmgreen, P., Donohew, L., Lorch, E. P., Hoyle, R. H., Stephenson, M. T. (2001). Television campaigns and adolescent marijuana use: Tests of sensation seeking targeting. American Journal of Public Health, 91(2), 292-296.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==In international health==
Targeting has been widely used in international health interventions and was found to be effective in promoting behavioral change.

Ahmed, Petzold, Kabir, and Tomson (2006) identified the problem in Bangladesh that there was not enough usage of formal health services among the ultra poor population.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. M., Petzold, M., Kabir, Z. N., &amp; Tomson, G. (2006). Targeted intervention for the ultra poor in rural Bangladesh: Does it make any difference in their health-seeking behaviour? Social Science &amp; Medicine, 63(11), 2899-2911.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to promote greater use of these health services, Ahmed and colleagues carried out a health intervention in Bangladesh targeting ultra poor households in rural areas in order to change their health-seeking behavior. The intervention provided ultra poor households with money for household activities (e.g. raising livestock, vegetables farming) to increase their income. In addition, it provided 18 months of supports, such as skill training (e.g. vegetable cultivation) and counseling information on health services, to make sure that the targeted people were able to make full use of the money and had the resources to use the health services if they chose to. This targeted intervention was found to be effective that it decreased the amount of self-care and increased the use of professional health care among the targeted population.

In another intervention, Lowndes, Alary, Labbe, et al. (2007) targeted male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa, in order to reduce the male clients' [[risky sexual behavior]] and HIV/STI rates.&lt;ref&gt;Lowndes, C. M., Alary, M., Labbe, A-C., Gnintoungbe, C., Belleau, M., Mukenge, L., Meda, H., Ndour, M., Anagonou, S., &amp; Gbaguidi, A. (2007). Interventions among male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa: An essential component of targeted HIV preventive interventions. Sexually Transmitted Infection, 83, 577-581.&lt;/ref&gt; During this peer-education intervention, trained health educators approached male clients at prostitution venues at night, discussed with them HIV and STI transmission risks, educated them about proper condom use, and distributed condoms. Although HIV prevalence remained unchanged, the intervention effectively affected knowledge and there was an increase in the condom use rate among the targeted population.

==Ethical considerations==
Despite its effectiveness in promoting behavioral change, targeting strategy should be used with caution and with careful considerations of ethics. Kass (2001) suggested that interventions targeting already vulnerable segments of the population may face certain ethical challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Kass, N. E. (2001). An ethics framework for public health. American Journal of Public Health, 91(11), 1776-1782.&lt;/ref&gt; Potential burden and harm in these health programs may include risks to privacy and confidentiality, risks to liberty and self-determination, and risks to justice. Subgroups who are targeted in interventions take most of the burden from the process (for example, their privacy may be intruded) while the benefits resulted from the health interventions are for the general public (e.g. improvements in mortality). Kass posed the question whether the unequal distribution of burden and benefits is ethical.
Moreover, the evidence of intervention effectiveness may not be strong enough at times. Thus it may not be known for sure whether the benefits the targeted audience may gain from the intervention will outweigh the harms they will be put in. Hence, health experts face another ethical dilemma.

Kass further pointed out that targeting may create stigma that some segments of the population are more vulnerable to certain diseases, which might result in social harms, such as psychological distress and discrimination. For example, although the HIV interventions targeting male clients of female sex workers in Benin&lt;ref&gt;Lowndes, C. M., Alary, M., Labbe, A-C., Gnintoungbe, C., Belleau, M., Mukenge, L., Meda, H., Ndour, M., Anagonou, S., &amp; Gbaguidi, A. (2007). Interventions among male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa: An essential component of targeted HIV preventive interventions. Sexually Transmitted Infection, 83, 577-581.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to HIV prevention, one possible stigma that it may create is that male clients of female sex workers are high risk population of HIV infection. This stigma may create anxiety and panic among the targeted population. On the other hand, if a subgroup were never targeted in interventions, they may not believe that they are at the risk of diseases. People who were not targeted in HIV interventions, e.g. people with regular sex partners, may perceive themselves as not at the risk of HIV infection and hence continue engaging in risky sexual behaviors.

Given the above discussed ethical dilemma that targeted health interventions may face, Kass suggested that, if health programs and health resources are going to be unequally allocated (e.g. targeting ethnic minority groups), they should be done with caution and be based on strong intervention effectiveness evidences.

==Targeting or tailoring? Competing definitions==
While Kreuter and Skinner's (2000) definition of targeting "the development of a single intervention approach for a defined population subgroup that takes into account characteristics shared by the subgroups' members" is now widely accepted in international health, targeting was defined in a few different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Skinner, C. S. (2000). Tailoring: what's in a name? Health Education Research, 15(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to understand the concept of tailoring in order to capture the idea of targeting, as interventions using targeting strategy were mislabeled as tailoring in some health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., Orleans, C. T., Fleischer, L., Cristinzio, S., Resch, N., Telepchak, J., et al. (1994). Does tailoring matter? The impact of a tailored guide on ratings and short-term smoking-	related outcomes for older smokers. Health Education Research, Theory and Practice, 9(1), 69–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Pasick (1997)defined tailoring as "the adaptation of interventions to best fit the relevant needs and characteristics of a specified target population".&lt;ref&gt;Pasick, R. J. (1997). Socioeconomic and culture factors in the development and use of theory. In K. Glanz, F. M. Lewis, &amp; B. K. Rimer (Eds.), Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research and Practice (pp.425-440). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Eakin and colleagues described tailoring as "a process of producing a video whose content and characters are adapted for or designed to appeal to a particular target population". Both statements would now be considered as a more appropriate definition of "targeting" according to Kreuter and Skinner (2000). The distinction between targeting and tailoring is that targeting is to design information for a defined population subgroup while tailoring is to develop interventions for one specific person based on the individual characteristics.

Another competing definition of targeting was developed by Rimal and Adkin (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Rimal, R. N. &amp; Adkin, A. D. (2003). Using computers to narrowcast health messages: The role of audience segmentation, targeting and tailoring in health promotion. In A. M. Dorsey, K. I. Miller, R. Parrott, &amp; T. L. Thompson (Eds.), Handbook of Health Communication (pp. 497-513). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that both targeting and tailoring should follow the [[audience segmentation]] process, which is to divide audience into highly homogeneous clusters. They distinguish targeting and tailoring by suggesting that targeting is the selection of communication channel for the health campaign while tailoring is about message design.

Despite the wide acceptance of the Kreuter and Skinner (2000) definition, Rimer (2000 pointed out that, although some "tailored" intervention would now be appropriately labeled as "targeted" intervention, these published projects are out there and the article titles remain as "tailored", which might create confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K. (2000). Response to Kreuter and Skinner. Health Education Research, 15(4), 503.&lt;/ref&gt; Rimer suggested that precision of language is important in order to avoid confusion. For people who are trying to understand targeting and tailoring, it is important to keep in mind the inconsistent labeling of targeting and tailoring in earlier published articles and to make critical judgments when reading.

[[Image:Christian Aid campaigners with Hilary Benn and Andrew Smith 20050127.jpg|thumb|Activists from [[Christian Aid]] lobbying for Trade Justice.]]

'''Trade justice''' is a campaign by [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]], plus efforts by other actors, to change the rules and practices of [[International trade|world trade]] in order to promote fairness. These organizations include consumer groups, trade unions, faith groups, [[aid agency|aid agencies]] and environmental groups.

The organizations campaigning for trade justice posit this concept in opposition to [[free trade]], the advocates of which often also claim pro-poor outcomes.  Trade justice advocates argue that truly free trade does not and will never exist, and that governmental policies on trade should be in the public interest, rather than the interest of wealthy entities who try to influence trade negotiation to benefit their individual interests. Advocates of trade justice argue that growing inequity and serious gaps in [[social justice]], and the global export of [[terrorism]], are symptoms of an economic system that permits harms to be exported to other countries, while importing their goods.  They point to [[extinction]], [[deforestation]], [[social unrest]], as consequences of [[globalisation]], and in particular of an "unfair" globalisation. In the past, the responses sought by critics of the international trade system included various penalties on "unfair" goods. This argument generally made little headway against the long-term movement towards [[free trade]]; imposition of penalties for "[[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]" was sometimes motivated by domestic political reasons such as the United States imposition of [[steel tariffs]] in 2001).

Today, the trade justice movement concentrates more on the abolition of [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and dumping, and to a much lesser extent on offsetting penalties on "unfair" goods. Indeed, although there are many who are still critical of free trade in general, there is a trend towards campaigning against what is seen as [[hypocrisy]] by [[developed countries]] in using [[protectionism]] against the poorest countries, especially in agricultural products, while requiring them to leave their own producers without protection.

== Trade justice movement ==

The [[Trade Justice Movement]] in the UK was the first formal coalition of groups to use the term "trade justice" (partly because in the UK, "[[fair trade]]" usually refers to [[Fairtrade certification]] and is a consumer model of change rather than an overtly political movement calling for government action). The term trade justice has been widely adopted internationally by campaign groups, for example by the over 100 national platforms of the [[Global Call to Action Against Poverty]] where it is one of the four main demands. In many countries "[[fair trade]]" is used as well as or instead of "trade justice".

The global institutions that are most often targeted in trade justice campaigns against the alleged injustices of the current international trade system are the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB). Campaigners also lobby their own governments with the intention of creating pressure on them to prioritise poverty reduction when making international trade rules. In trading blocs such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the campaigns seek to influence policy across a number of member state governments.

"Trade Justice" and "Fair Trade" were originally used by those supporting [[social justice]] and the alleviation of the intense [[poverty]] found in many developing nations. They contrasted "fair trade" with 'unfair' [[international trade]] practices. It is associated particularly with [[Labor union|labour unions]] and [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], in their criticism of disparities between the protections for [[Capital (economics)|capital]] versus those for labour and the environment. The use of the term has expanded beyond campaigns to reform current trading practices, and the major institutions such as the [[World Trade Organization]] which embody them. Now it has become a movement to allow consumers to choose ''not'' to participate in these practices. [[Fairtrade labelling]] or "Fairtrade certification" allows [[consumer]]s to identify goods especially commodities such as [[coffee]], that meet certain agreed standards of fairness.

== Issues ==

Academics such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] argue that the insertion of a [[constructive ambiguity]] such as valuing [[innovation]] in [[bilateral trade agreements]] (and then according [[normative]] and ongoing [[lobbying]] power to such textual negotiating truces by formally linking them with [[non-violation nullification of benefits]] provisions) may undermine democratic [[sovereignty]] with regard to construction of domestic policy, particularly in areas such as the environment and public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Faunce | first = Thomas Alured | author-link = Thomas Alured Faunce | title = Reference pricing for pharmaceuticals: is the Australia–United States free trade agreement affecting Australia’s pharmaceutical benefits scheme? | journal = Med J Aust | year = 2007 | volume = 187 | pages = 240–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Faunce | first1 = TA | last2 = Neville | first2 = W | last3 = Anton | first3 = Wasson A | contribution = Non Violation Nullification of Benefit Claims: Opportunities and Dilemmas in a Rule-Based WTO Dispute Settlement System | editor-last = Bray | editor-first = M | title = Ten Years of WTO Dispute Settlement: Australian Perspectives | publisher = Office of Trade Negotiations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade | place = Commonwealth of Australia | pages = 123–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is strenuously contested by trade law officials and many domestic policy makers.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

"The mostly widely referred to demand of trade justice campaigners is access to the markets of developed countries or rich countries. When developing countries export to developed country markets, they often face tariff barriers that can be as much as four times higher than those encountered by developed countries. Poverty claims that those barriers cost poor countries $100 billion a year – twice as much as they receive in aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalfootprints.org/trade|title=Trade footprint|last=|first=|date=|website=HEC Global Learning Centre|access-date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trade justice campaigners focus in some way on the agricultural subsidies of rich countries that make it difficult for farmers in poor countries to compete.  For example, they argue that the European Union's agricultural export subsidies encourage [[overproduction]] of goods such as [[tomato]]es or [[sugar]], which are then sold cheaply or 'dumped' in poor countries. Local farmers cannot sell their goods as cheaply and go out of business.&lt;ref name="Oxfam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godfrey|first1=Claire|title=Stop the Dumping! How EU Agricultural Subsidies Are Damaging Livelihoods in the Developing World|url=http://www.iatp.org/files/Stop_the_Dumping_How_EU_Agricultural_Subsidies.htm|publisher=Institute for Agriculture &amp; Trade Policy|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=2002|archive-date=16 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216214819/https://www.iatp.org/files/Stop_the_Dumping_How_EU_Agricultural_Subsidies.htm|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign points to the treatment of agriculture at the WTO, which has institutionalised these injustices. In the few instances where developing countries have used the complex and expensive WTO process to declare subsidies (e.g. US cotton subsidies) excessive, developed countries ignore these rulings, which the WTO itself does not enforce. Recently rich countries have begun to talk about cutting export subsidies, but they often demand greater access to poor country markets in return.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

The term "trade justice" emphasizes that even if the playing field were level, instead of tilted against developing countries, the poorest developing countries in particular would still struggle to gain from trade if forced to trade under [[free trade]] terms.  This is because of their overwhelming lack of competitiveness – poor countries do not have huge stocks of exports waiting to be shipped to rich countries, instead most small farmers want to be able to sell their goods locally.{{Citation needed |date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.schooleconomicscience.org/em_post/justice-and-international-trade/|title=Justice and International Trade - School of Economic Science|work=School of Economic Science|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/27/farming-subsidies-distort-advantages-food-insecurity|title=Why farming subsidies still distort advantages and cause food insecurity|last=Ghosh|first=Jayati|date=2013-11-27|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-20|work=|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Transnational organization''' is a term used in scholarly literature. It refers to [[international organization]]s (usually, [[international nongovernmental organization]]s) that "transcend" the idea of a [[nation-state]].

The distinction between an international and a '''transnational organization''' is unclear and has been criticized by some scholars (ex. Colás, 2002).

Transnational relations have been defined as “contacts, coalitions, and interactions across state boundaries that are not controlled by the central foreign policy organs of governments.”  Examples of transnational entities are “multinational business enterprises and revolutionary movements; trade unions and scientific networks; international air transport cartels and communications activities in outer space.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nye, Jr.|first=Joseph S.|author2=Robert O. Keohane|title=Transnational Relations and World Politics: An Introduction|journal=International Organization|year=1971|volume=25|issue=3|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/sdrelint/ficheros_materiales/materiales016.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2011|page=331|doi=10.1017/s0020818300026187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transnational social movements are “the broad tendencies that often manifest themselves in particular [[International non-governmental organization|International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs)]].”  Examples of transnational social movements include human rights, women’s, peace, labor, green, or student movements manifested in [[Amnesty International]], the [[Peace Brigades International]], the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Robin|title=Transnational social movements: an assessment|url=http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/working%20papers/cohen.pdf|publisher=Department of Sociology, University of Warwick|accessdate=27 November 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further definition: “An organization is "transnational" rather than "national" if it carries on significant centrally-directed operations in the territory of two or more nation-states. Similarly, an organization will be called "international" rather than "national" only if the control of the organization is explicitly shared among representatives of two or more nationalities. And an organization is "multinational" rather than "national" only if people from two or more nationalities participate significantly in its operation.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=336|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Transnational organizations are designed to facilitate the pursuit of a single interest within many national units.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=338|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Regions Organization / Forum of Regional Governments and Global Associations of Regions (ORU Fogar)''' is an [[international organization]], which aims to bring together regions from all over the world and represents them before other international organizations in order to boost a global policy of balanced [[Economic development|development]] and territorial cohesion.

The Organization's main objective is to seek the regions' recognition as major players in [[global governance]]. ORU Fogar defends that states' [[decentralization]] power towards other actors accelerates development; consequently fostering [[democracy]] by the proximity between these new actors and the citizens. ORU Fogar promotes a model based on a strong [[regional government]], with legally recognized capabilities and competences and also budgets in compliance with those competences. Amongst its members, ORU Fogar has important European and Latin American regions, as well as regional governments from Africa and Asia.

The organization acts according to two approaches:
* An integrated approach generated in the territories to design and implement in the field solutions to the new challenges that these territories are facing.
* The promotion of new governance rules at a global level, including the regional scale, allowing the development of this territorial approach.

== Objectives ==
ORU Fogar's founding objectives can be wrapped up into three main topics: To '''raise the voice of regions before all of the international bodies''', through the association of regions from all over the world in order to work together for development; to '''defend a new global governance''' where regions have a relevant role in encouraging the participation of regional governments in the creation of new policies and '''work for regions''' in order for national governments to take into account the regional dimensión and cultural diversity, through the promotion of competitiveness and regional growth, but always trying to follow a sustainable development and respect for climate approach.

== History ==
[[File:Buró ORU Montevideo.jpg|thumb|315x315px|ORU Fogar's Executive Bureau at Montevideo (2015)]]
Facing the new global situation, [[region]]s gathered to achieve a coordinated response to the current challenges in a worldwide association. That meeting was named "Forum of Regional Governments and Global Associations of Regions (FOGAR)", held in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], in August 2007. It was conducted on the basis of the "Declaration of the Regions on their participation in the governance of [[globalization]]" signed in [[Marseille]], PACA, [[France]], on the occasion of the first international convention for a regional approach to development. Seventeen networks of regions from all continents were the founders of the Organization, with a representation of more than 900 subnational governments. Since July 2010, membership in ORU Fogar is also opened to regions and [[federated state]]s individually.

[[File:Voice of America Bethany Relay Station.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting is the main building and campus of the original VOA, Bethany Relay Station.]]
'''The [[Voice of America]]'s Bethany Relay Station''' was located in [[Butler County, Ohio]]'s [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|Union Township]] about 25 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], adjacent to the transmitter site of [[WLW]]. Starting in 1944 during [[World War II]] it transmitted American radio programming abroad on [[shortwave]] frequencies, using 200,000-watt transmitters built by [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation|Crosley]] engineers under the direction of R.J. Rockwell. The site was developed to provide 'fallback' transmission facilities inland and away from the East Coast, where transmitters were located in Massachusetts, on Long Island in New York, and in New Jersey, all close to the ocean, subject to attack from German submarines or other invading forces.

Programming originated from studios in New York until 1954, when VOA headquarters moved to Washington.

The station operated until 1994. The facility took its name from the [[Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio|Liberty Township]] community of [[Bethany, Ohio|Bethany]], which was about two miles north of the facility.

==History==
In 1943, the United States government bought nearly all of [[section (land)|Section]] 12 of Township 3, Range 2 of the [[Symmes Purchase]], the northeasternmost section of Union Township. From Hazel Beckley, 170 acres (688,000 m²) were purchased; from Philip Condon, 143 acres (579,000 m²); from Lola Gray Coy, 100 acres (405,000 m²); from John Miller, 69 acres (279,000 m²); and from Suzie Steinman, 142 acres (575,000 m²). The site was chosen for its elevation and its shallow bedrock and is today bounded by Tylersville Road on the south, Cox Road to the west, Liberty Way to the north, and [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler]]-[[Warren County, Ohio|Warren]] Road.

The transmitters were built by [[Powel Crosley Jr.]]'s [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] about one mile west of the company's tower for [[WLW-AM]] in [[Mason, Ohio|Mason]]. The [[Office of War Information]] began broadcasting in July 1944 and [[Adolf Hitler]] is said to have denounced the "Cincinnati liars". Following the war, with the OWI abolished, the facility was taken over by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] in 1945. It became part of the newly created [[United States Information Agency]] in 1953. The Crosley Broadcasting Corporation operated the facility for the government until November 1963, when the Voice of America assumed direct control.

At its peak the facility had six transmitters broadcasting with 250&amp;nbsp;kW and two transmitting with 50&amp;nbsp;kW.

The facility was closed on November 14, 1994; because of changing technologies, the transmissions shifted to [[satellite]]s. The towers were brought down from December 1997 to February 1998.

==Post-closing use==
Most of the land was turned over to the [[Butler County, Ohio|county]] and [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|township]] for use as a [[park]].

Part in the southwest corner was sold to developers who have erected a shopping center called the Voice of America Centre.

The [[Miami University Voice of America Learning Center]] opened on the site in January 2009.

==National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting==
The 30,000 sq. ft. former Bethany Station building at 8070 Tylersville Road is being transformed into the National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting, a historical center about the history of The Voice of America, radio and television.

Using a blueprint developed by Jack Rouse Associates, the facility features displays and interactive experiences that relate the story of the Voice of America and incorporate other related collections from Media Heritage and the Gray History of Wireless Museum in [[Cincinnati]].

Displays include the radio station control room, re-creations of radio and television studios from the 1920s through the present, [[Old-time radio]] memorabilia and from the early days of television, and displays about area pioneers in the development of radio technology.

An amateur radio club West Chester Amateur Radio Association, also operates a station using the callsign WC8VOA.

World Health Organization. Accessed September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The participating institutions partner with WHO to perform research, provide training, or offer other services in furthering the WHO health agenda. These partners are designated by the WHO director-general as a part of a collaborative network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/collaboratingcentres/cc_historical/en/index1.html Collaborating Centres, Definition]. World Health Organization. Accessed September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By using networks of established organizations, WHO is able to strengthen the scientific validity of its work and lower the costs of research.

==Centres worldwide==
The World Health Organization has established networks related to a variety of health topics. For example, WHO has put in place centres focused on organ transplants, hearing loss prevention, hepatitis, leprosy, ethics, and maternal health. To move the work forward, WHO has numerous designated centres in each inhabited continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/whocc/Reports.aspx WHO Collaborating Centres global database].

'''World Population day''' is an annual event, observed on July 11 every year, which seeks to raise awareness of [[world population|global population]] issues. The event was established by the Governing Council of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] in 1989. It was inspired by the public interest in Five Billion Day on July 11, 1987, the approximate date on which the world's population reached five billion people. World Population Day aims to increase people's awareness on various population issues such as the importance of family planning, gender equality, poverty, maternal health and human rights.

The day was suggested by Dr KC Zachariah in which population reaches Five Billion when he worked as Sr Demographer at World Bank.

While press interest and general awareness in the global population surges only at the increments of whole billions of people, the world population increases annually by 100 million approximately every 14 months. The world population reached 7,400,000,000 on February 6, 2016; the world population had reached 7,500,000,000 at around 16:21 on April 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info|title=Worldometers real time world statistics|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the conflict that was referred to as the World War before the start of the second war|World War I}}
{{War}}
A '''world war''' is a large-scale [[war]] which affects the whole world directly or indirectly. World wars span multiple countries on multiple [[continents]] or just two countries, with battles fought in many [[theater (warfare)|theaters]]. While a variety of global conflicts have been subjectively deemed "world wars", such as the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Terror]], the term is widely and usually accepted only as it is retrospectively applied to two major international conflicts that occurred during the 20th century: [[World War I]] (1914–1918) and [[World War II]] (1939–1945).

==Origin of the term==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cited the first known usage in the [[English language]] to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] newspaper: the ''People's Journal'' in 1848: "A war among the great powers is now necessarily a world-war." The term "world war" had been used in 1850 by [[Karl Marx]] and his associate, [[Friedrich Engels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1887/12/15.htm|title=Introduction to Borkheim|last=Engels |first=Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Class Struggles in France''. [[Rasmus B. Anderson]] in 1889 described an episode in [[Teutonic mythology]] as a “world war” (Swedish: ''världskrig''), justifying this description by a line in an [[Old Norse]] epic poem, "[[Völuspá]]: folcvig fyrst i heimi" ("The first great war in the world".)&lt;ref&gt;[[Rasmus Björn Anderson]] (translator: [[Viktor Rydberg]]), ''Teutonic Mythology'', vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-uJRw32enFQC&amp;pg=PT237 p. 139], London: S. Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1889 {{OCLC|626839}}.&lt;/ref&gt; German writer August Wilhelm Otto Niemann had used the term "world war" in the title of his anti-British novel, ''Der Weltkrieg: Deutsche Träume'' (''The World War: German Dreams'') in 1904, published in English as ''The Coming Conquest of England''.

In English, the term "First World War" had been used by [[Charles à Court Repington]], as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of [[Harvard University]] in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qi.com/infocloud/the-first-world-war The First World War] Quite Interesting Ltd. Encyclopedia. Downloaded Feb. 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "World War I" was coined by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on page 28b of its June 12, 1939 issue. In the same article, on page 32, the term "World War II" was first used speculatively to describe the upcoming war. The first use for the actual war came in its issue of September 11, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3195322/world-war-grey-friday/ |title=Grey Friday: TIME Reports on World War II Beginning |work=TIME |date=September 11, 1939 |accessdate=20 October 2014 |quote=World War II began last week at 5:20 a. m. (Polish time) Friday, September 1, when a German bombing plane dropped a projectile on Puck, fishing village and air base in the armpit of the Hel Peninsula.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week earlier, on September 4, the day after France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, the Danish newspaper ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'' used the term on its front page, saying "The Second World War broke out yesterday at 11 a.m."&lt;ref&gt;"Den anden Verdenskrig udbrød i Gaar Middags Kl. 11", ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', September 4, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speculative fiction]] authors had been noting the concept of a Second World War in 1919 and 1920, when [[Milo Hastings]] wrote his [[dystopian]] novel, ''City of Endless Night''.
Other languages have also adopted the "world war" terminology, for example; in [[French language|French]]: "world war" is translated as ''guerre mondiale'', in [[German language|German]]: ''Weltkrieg'' (which, prior to the war, had been used in the more abstract meaning of a global conflict), in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''guerra mondiale'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''guerra mundial'', in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''verdenskrig'', and in [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''мировая война'' (''mirovaya voyna''.)

==First World War==
{{main|World War I}}
It occurred from 1914 to 1918 and in terms of human [[history of technology|technological history]], the scale of World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the [[second industrial revolution]] and the resulting [[globalization]] that allowed global power projection and [[mass production]] of military hardware. Wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the [[Atomic Age]] and the resulting danger of [[mutually-assured destruction]]. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances (the [[German Empire|German]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires against the [[British Empire|British]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], and [[French colonial empire|French]] Empires) was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact, a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a [[domino effect]] of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies, thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of [[pre-Columbian]] times.

[[War crimes]] were perpetrated in World War I. [[chemical weapons in World War I|Chemical weapons]] were used in the First World War despite the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The Ottoman Empire was responsible for the [[Armenian genocide]], the death of over one million Armenians during the First World War.

==Second World War==
{{main|World War II}}{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945 and is the only conflict in which [[atomic bombs]] have been used. [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], in [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|devastated]] by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. [[Nazi Germany]] was responsible for [[genocides]], most notably [[the Holocaust]], the killing of six million [[Jews]]. The [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Canada]] deported and [[interned]] minority groups within their own borders, and largely because of the conflict, many ethnic [[Germans]] were later expelled from [[Eastern Europe]]. Japan was responsible for attacking [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral nations]] without a [[declaration of war]], such as the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]]. It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied [[prisoners of war]] and the inhabitants of [[Asia]]. It also used Asians as [[forced labor]]ers and was responsible for the [[Nanking massacre]] where 250,000 civilians in the city were brutally murdered by Japanese troops. [[Non-combatants]] suffered at least as badly as or worse than [[combatants]], and the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was often blurred by belligerents of [[total war]] in both conflicts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The outcome of World War II had a profound effect on the course of world history. The old European empires either collapsed or were dismantled as a direct result of the wars' crushing costs and, in some cases, their fall was due to the defeat of imperial powers. The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its ideological foe, the Soviet Union, in close competition. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's [[nation-states]] for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created in the aftermath of the wars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Institutions such as the [[United Nations]] were established to collectivize international affairs, with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well, such as by advances in [[jet aircraft]], [[penicillin]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and [[electronic computers]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Third World War==
{{main article|World War III}}
Since the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during the Second World War, there has been a widespread and prolonged fear of a potential Third World War between nuclear-armed powers. The Third World War is generally considered a successor to the Second World War and is often suggested to become a [[nuclear war]], devastating in nature and likely much more violent than the First World War and the Second World War combined; in 1947, [[Albert Einstein]] commented that "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Alice | last = Calaprice | title = The new quotable Einstein | page = 173 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2005 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | isbn = 978-0-691-12075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7406337/ |title=The culture of Einstein|publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities and has been [[World War III in popular culture|explored in fiction]] in many countries. Concepts have ranged from purely-conventional scenarios, to limited use of nuclear weapons, to the complete destruction of the planet's surface.

Various former government officials, politicians, authors, and military leaders (including the following people: [[James Woolsey]]&lt;ref name = "WoolseyWWIV"&gt;{{cite web|year=2002|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2002/021116-ww4.htm|title=World War IV|accessdate=2010-02-04}}Woolsey claims victory in WWIII, start of WWIV&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre de Marenches]],&lt;ref name = "MarenchesWWIV"&gt;{{Cite book| year=1992|title= The Fourth World War: Diplomacy and Espionage…| asin=0688092187}}Book regarding alleged WWIV&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliot Cohen]],&lt;ref name = "CohenWWIV"&gt;{{cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001493| title= World War IV: Let's call this conflict what it is.|accessdate = 2010-02-04}}Why war on terrorism should be called WWIV&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Subcomandante Marcos]]&lt;ref name="fourth"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/nep/v002/2.3marcos.html |title=The Fourth World War Has Begun |author=Subcomandante Marcos |authorlink=Subcomandante Marcos |journal=Nepantla: Views from South |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=559–572 |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have attempted to apply the labels of the “Third World War” and “Fourth World War” to various past and present global wars since the closing of the Second World War, for example, the Cold War and the War on Terror, respectively. Among these are former American, French, and Mexican government officials, military leaders, politicians, and authors: Despite their efforts, none of these wars are commonly deemed world wars.

Wars described by some historians as "World War Zero" include the [[Seven Years' War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/07/01/why-the-first-world-war-wasnt-really|title=Why the first world war wasn't really|journal=The Economist|date=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the onset of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2087924-world-war-zero-brought-down-mystery-civilisation-of-sea-people/|title=World War Zero brought down mystery civilisation of 'sea people'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003) involved nine nations and led to ongoing low-level warfare despite an official peace and the first democratic elections in 2006. It has often been referred to as "Africa's World War".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/africas-world-war-gerard-prunier/1009337346?ean=9780195374209 |title=Africa's World War: Congo, the Rwandan Genocide, and the Making of a Continental Catastrophe |first=Gerard |last=Prunier |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |isbn=9780195374209 |year=2014 |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early-21st century the [[Syrian Civil War]] and the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi Civil War]] and their worldwide spillovers are sometimes described as [[proxy wars]] waged between the United States and Russia,&lt;ref name="turnproxy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/world/middleeast/syria-russia-airstrikes.html?_r=0 |title=U.S. Weaponry Is Turning Syria Into Proxy War With Russia |author= |work=The New York Times |accessdate=14 October 2015 |date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cain"&gt;{{cite news |author= |url= https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/04/john-mccain-russia-us-proxy-war-syria-obama-putin |title=John McCain says US is engaged in proxy war with Russia in Syria |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 October 2015 |date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prox"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/13/middleeast/syria-civil-war/index.html |title=U.S., Russia escalate involvement in Syria |author= |work=CNN |accessdate=17 October 2015 |date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stupid"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title="The Russians have made a serious mistake": how Putin's Syria gambit will backfire |publisher=The VOA |date=1 October 2015 |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/9434365/putin-syria-russia-mistake |access-date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led some commentators to characterize the situation as a "proto-world war" with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts.&lt;ref name="proto"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/16/world/middleeast/untangling-the-overlapping-conflicts-in-the-syrian-war.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0 |title=Untangling the Overlapping Conflicts in the Syrian War|author= |work=The New York Times |accessdate=19 October 2015 |date=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, few serious students of the subject would put the hemispheric figure at less than 75,000,000 to 100,000,000 (with approximately 8,000,000 to 12,000,000 north of Mexico).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
