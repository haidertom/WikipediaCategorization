      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">The '''386 Generation''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 386 세대; ---世代; ''sampallyuk sedae'') is the [[generation]] of [[South Korea]]ns born in the 1960s who were very active politically as young adults, and instrumental in the [[Minjung|democracy movement of the 1980s]]. 
==Etymology==
The term was coined in the early 1990s, in reference to what was then the latest computer model, Intel's [[Intel 80386|386]], and referring to people then in their 30s, having attended university in the 1980s, and born in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Lankov&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2008/04/180_18529.html|title=Fiasco of 386 Generation|date=5 February 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the time flows, the people in 386 generation are in their 40s and the '486 Generation' is also used.
==History==
This was the first generation of South Koreans to grow up free from the poverty that had marked South Korea in the recent past. The broad political mood of the generation was far more left-leaning than that of their parents, or their eventual children. They played a pivotal role in the [[June Democracy Movement|democratic protest]]s which forced President [[Chun Doo-hwan]] to call democratic elections in 1987, marking the transition from military rule to [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=eastwest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/news-center/east-west-wire/shinsedae-conservative-attitudes-of-a-new-generation-in-south-korea-and-the-impact-on-the-korean-presidential-election/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915155227/http://www.eastwestcenter.org/news-center/east-west-wire/shinsedae-conservative-attitudes-of-a-new-generation-in-south-korea-and-the-impact-on-the-korean-presidential-election/ |archivedate=2010-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the 386 generation now comprise much of the elite of South Korean society. [[Kim Dae-jung]] benefitted from widespread 386er support, but it is the election of [[Roh Moo-hyun]] who is the strongest demonstration of the more left-leaning politics of the generation.&lt;ref name="Lankov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/152611|title=OUT WITH THE OLD|date=3 August 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">{{about||the 1989 film|Anecdote (film)|a comparison of anecdote with other kinds of stories|traditional story}}
An '''''anecdote''''' is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|title=Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory, Third Ed.|year=1992|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally [[humor]]ous, anecdotes differ from [[joke]]s because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke [[laughter]] but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific [[wikt:quirk|quirk]] or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Epstein|first=Lawrence|title=A Treasury of Jewish Anecdotes|year=1989|publisher=Jason Aronson|location=Northvale, NJ|pages=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdote is "a story with a point."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Epstein|1989|pp=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Anecdotes may be real or fictional;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Kennedy |first=X. J.|title=Handbook of Literary Terms, Third Ed.|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anecdotal digression is a common feature of literary works,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cuddon|1992|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even oral anecdotes typically involve subtle exaggeration and dramatic shape designed to entertain the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |contributor-first=Jurgen |contributor-last=Heine |contribution=Die Anekdote |last=Knorrich |first=Otto |title=Formen der Literatur in Einzeldarstellugen |year=1981 |publisher=Alfred Kroner|location=Stuttgart|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an anecdote is always presented as the recounting of a real incident, involving actual persons and usually in an identifiable place. In the words of Jurgen Heine, they exhibit "a special realism" and "a claimed historical dimension."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heine|1981|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''anecdote'' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀνέκδοτον "unpublished", literally "not given out") comes from [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the biographer of [[Justinian I]], who produced a work entitled {{lang|grc|Ἀνέκδοτα}} (''Anekdota'', variously translated as ''Unpublished Memoirs'' or ''Secret History''), which is primarily a collection of short incidents from the private life of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court. Gradually, the term "anecdote" came to be applied&lt;ref&gt;Its first appearance in English is of 1676 (''[[OED]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; to any short tale utilized to emphasize or illustrate whatever point the author wished to make. In the context of [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Russian humor]], an anecdote refers to any short humorous story without the need of factual or biographical origins.

== Qualification as evidence ==
{{main|Anecdotal evidence}}
Anecdotal evidence is an informal account of [[evidence]] in the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to [[scientific evidence]], as evidence that cannot be investigated using the [[scientific method]]. The problem with arguing based on anecdotal evidence is that anecdotal evidence is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an [[informal fallacy]].

When used in [[advertising]] or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal evidence is often called a [[testimonial]]. The term is also sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony. [[Psychologist]]s have found that people are more likely to remember notable examples than the typical example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5591">'''Angelic tongues''' are the languages supposedly used by angels. It usually refers to sung praise in [[Second Temple period]] Jewish materials.

==Dead Sea Scrolls==
[[Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice]] is the principal source for angelic tongues at [[Qumran]]. The texts are fragmentary but appear to relate to praise tongues:
*[...] through the wonderful height [...] tongue of purity [...] gods (~yhla), seven [...] 4Q400 3 1, 1-2
* ...Psalm of praise, on the tongue of the fou[rth]...[Ps]alm of [tha]nksgiving, on the tongue of the fifth...[Psalm] of exultation, on the tongue of the sixth...Psalm of [singing, on the to]ngue of the seventh of the [chief] pri[nces,] a powerful song [to the God] of ho[lines] with its se[ven] wo[nd]er[ful songs] 4Q403 1 1, 1-6
* Proclaim his glory with the tongue of all who proclaim knowledge, his wonderful songs with the mouth of all who proclaim [him. For he is] God of all who sing {knowledge} for ever, and Judge in his power over all the spirits of understanding. 4Q4031 1 36-37
* ...The tongue of the first will be strengthened seven times with the tongue of the second to him....{this is repeated for the series up to the seventh}... 4Q403 1 2, 27-30

It is not clear whether the angelic tongues are coherent, intelligible to man. However, since Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is itself related to sung praise at the Qumran community, there is a parallel with coherent angelic praise tongues in Testament of Job.&lt;ref&gt;Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, edited by James H. Charlesworth and Carol A. Newsom. Theological Studies 54  2003 649–653.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Poirier ''Tongues of Angels: Concept of Angelic Languages in Classical Jewish and Christian Texts '' 2010. XI, 224 pages. WUNT II 287  p110 "Cf. Sheres and Blau 1995:84: "But the angels' speech [in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice] is not recorded. Why do we not hear what they are saying? One commentator has suggested that the big difference between the 'tongues of men and of angels' rendered their idiom unintelligible. Perhaps also, at such auspicious moments the sectarians themselves spoke in tongues (an ecstatic incomprehensible language), a chanting that would drown out what was going on. The sectarians' taste for the esoteric is evident elsewhere"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George J. Brooke, Hindy Najman, Loren T. Stuckenbruck ''The significance of Sinai: traditions about Sinai and divine Revelation in Judaism and Christianity.'' 2008 p57 "Participation in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice liturgy is reserved for those sufficiently righteous and ... in order to acquire “tongues of angels” would seem to have been such an elite."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loren T. Stückenbruck ''Angel veneration and Christology: a study in early Judaism and in the Christology of the Apocalypse of John, by Loren T. Stuckenbruck. WUNT 2/70'' 1995 p156 ''The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice This brings us to a consideration of the angelic sabbath-liturgy (Shi- rot 'Olat ha-Shabbat), which was not fully published and ... and seven tongues, each being seven-fold more powerful than the next ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testament of Job==
The pseudepigraphical [[Testament of Job]] (ca.100 BCE–100CE) contains a conclusion which is believed to relate to the compiling of the hymnbook used by a [[Therapeutae]] community.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of Job'' in Charlesworth J.H., The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol.II, Doubleday 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Job gives one of his daughters "a cord" (a stringed instrument of some kind?) 
* "And she took on another heart—no longer minded toward earthly things—but ecstatically in the angelic dialect, sending up a hymn to God in accord with the style of the angels. And as she spoke ecstatically, she allowed “The Spirit” to be on her garment." (T. Job 48:2-3)&lt;ref&gt;http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/ot/pseudo/test-job.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Job’s other daughters likewise took on “the dialect of archons”, “the dialect of those and the “dialect of the cherubim” (T. Job 49:1-50:3). The “cherubim” are also mentioned Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as blessing God (4Q403 1 2, 15, cf. 4Q405 20 2, 3). 

There is parallel description of sung prophecy among the Therapeutae in [[Alexandria]] by [[Philo]], but no mention there of angelic tongues.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, On the Contemplative Life http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book34.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
A possible reference to Jewish practices of angelic tongues is 1Co13:1 "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal." The distinction "of men" and "of angels" may suggests that a distinction was known to the Corinthians. If a distinction is intended then 1Co14:10 "There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning" may imply that "tongues of men" were intelligible, whereas 1Co14:2 For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit." refers to angelic tongues. The problem with this is that the "angelic" tongues documented at Qumran and among the Therapeutae appear to be inspired, but coherent and intelligible, sung praise. Against this is the view of Dunn that "It is evident then that Paul thinks of [[glossolalia]] as language". {{dubious|date=December 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;James D. G. Dunn Jesus and the Spirit: "A Study of the Religious and Charismatic Experience of Jesus and the First Christians as Reflected in the New Testament," p. 244 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bobby soxer''' is a 1940s sociological coinage describing the often very zealous fans of [[traditional pop music]], in particular the singer [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpLcC4a5fAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Cassell's Dictionary of Slang | publisher=Sterling Publishing Company | author=Green, Jonathan | year=2005 | pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby soxers were usually [[teenage]] girls and young adult women aged 13 to 25. Fashionable adolescent girls wore [[poodle skirt]]s and rolled down their [[sock]]s to the ankle. In high schools and colleges, the [[gym]]nasium was often used as a [[:wikt:dance floor|dance floor]]; however, since street shoes and street detritus might damage the polished wood [[floor]]s, the students were required to remove their shoes and flop dance in their [[bobby sock]]s, hence the terms "bobby soxer" and "[[sock hop]]".

Adopting (in her teenage years) an impressionable adolescent persona, former child actress [[Shirley Temple]] portrayed the type in the film ''[[The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer]]'' (1947). The 1959 [[Frankie Avalon]] song "[[Bobby Sox to Stockings]]" also referenced the phenomenon. Later, [[Bobby Sheen]] performed under the name [[Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans]].

The '''Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students''' (CSFES) is a [[non-profit organization]] which Danielle Grijalva started in the [[United States of America]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826071004/http://csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html |date=2013-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee was created to protect foreign children who could be abused both physically and mentally if not put into a safe home.

== Origins ==
Grijalva had worked as an area representative for CCI (Center for Cultural Interchange),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10news.com/about/10news-leadership-award-winner-danielle-grijalva ABC10news, 2008 Jul 03, Leadership Award Winner Danielle Grijalva]&lt;/ref&gt; a foreign-exchange program for student that is based in [[Illinois]]. As an area representative she had the task of ensuring the safe placement of [[Student exchange program|exchange students]] travelling to the United States. As she gained experience as a representative, Ms. Grijalva learned that not all exchange students were placed with safe host-families.

In 2004, Danielle Grijalva resigned from CCI in protest when she found that another coordinator in the same agency had knowingly placed two boys from non-English speaking backgrounds in the home of a [[pederast]] who immediately began to groom them with gay pornography (which constitutes a crime in California), to provide them alcohol (which is against the law), and to deprive them of bathroom privacy. This was the eighth time that this man had been allowed to host boys.

Grijalva was appalled when she found that her agency was totally disinterested in what had happened to the boys, but threatened her with a lawsuit if she continued her concerns. The agency then concocted the allegations that the boys were expelled from high school for downloading pornography from their host father's computer.  The school principal contacted the Police Department and local [[Child Protective Services]]. Police, not the agency, removed the boys from the home. Their report claimed that when the officer went to the door, the man who answered stood there with his pants around his legs.

When she expressed concerns about future students being placed in this man's home, the manager allegedly said, "Now, Danielle, we cannot discriminate against homosexuality.  Back off!"

The president of the agency interfered with law enforcement stating that the boys concocted the allegations; because, they were accustomed to having a swimming pool in their back yard and wanted to be placed in a house that had one. The manager refused to change the placement and, hearing their allegations, notified police that the boys had attempted to steal from their host when they were caught looking for their passports and return tickets to go home. They, in common with most others in this situation, were instructed to sign a statement that the breakdown of the placement was due entirely to their own bad behavior, and they were told that they would be denied future access to the US if they refused to sign. This is sheer bullying; because, agencies do not have the power to prevent return visits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/22CFR/HTML/22CFR/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-3590/0-0-0-4552.html § Sec. 62. 25 Secondary school students]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the boys did not know that they were being blackmailed and they signed. This of course prevents them from suing their abusers and the agencies.

When in Grijalva wrote to inform the German agencies responsible for sending the boys to the US, she received an aggressive response. When she persisted and wrote again, she received a one-sentence reply: "When we told you we didn't wish to hear from you, we meant it."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Activities ==
Grijalva received so many complaints from parents and students that she set up a website which has attracted more and more horror stories. She established the International Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students (CSFES), enlisting the support of others who were aware of the problems. CSFES became a registered charity in 2007, by which time its filing cabinets were full of complaints from parents along with newspaper reports of exchange students raped, molested, and exposed to every type of extortion. CSFES has no power other than its ability to support parents and students, to publicise the actions of unscrupulous agencies using media, to lobby politicians and to lodge complaints with government and exchange agency officials who invariably blame students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826071004/http://csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html |date=2013-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSFES maintains that every exchange student deserves a safe exchange experience. To ensure this, Ms. Grijalva tries to educate various government agencies, the exchange organizations themselves and potential host-families.&lt;ref&gt;

Unfortunately, not all exchange students end up in safe host-families. CSFES then steps in and acts as an advocate for exchange students in the US. Due to the efforts of CSFES, many exchange students who have felt alone in difficult circumstances have been able to achieve their goal of a good experience.

Since the beginning, Ms. Grijalva has gained the attention of the US media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2009570258_apusexchangestudentwatchdog.html The Seattle Times, 2009 Jul 30, Calif. mom exposes abuses of exchange students]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/07/15/us.exchange.students/index.html CNN.com/US, 2009 Jul 16, Exchange students live American nightmare]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone has been happy about this attention. Exchange organizations have filed lawsuits against CSFES because of its work.
Media in non-US countries have contacted CSFES to get their take on the way the exchange industry works in the US. CSFES have become the go-to fount of information that has been needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/jobb/Sexpress_-tyveri-og-utnytting-2741873.html Bergens Tidende, 2012 Jul 30, Sexpress, tyvery og utnytting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Confucius''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ən|ˈ|f|j|uː|ʃ|ə|s}} {{respell|kən|FEW|shəs}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Confucius}}&lt;/ref&gt; 551–479 BC)&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riegel|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/confucius/ online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and [[Chinese philosophy|philosopher]] of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of [[History of China|Chinese history]].

The philosophy of Confucius, also known as [[Confucianism]], emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity. His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] era only to be suppressed in favor of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] during the [[Qin dynasty]]. Following the victory of [[Han dynasty|Han]] over [[Chu-Han Contention|Chu]] after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received [[State religion|official sanction]] and were further developed into a system known in the West as [[Neo-Confucianism]], and later [[New Confucianism|New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism)]].

Confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the [[Chinese classics|Chinese classic texts]] including all of the [[Five Classics]], but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. [[Aphorism]]s concerning his teachings were compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', but only many years after his death.

Confucius's principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty, [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives, recommending family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle "Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself", the [[Golden Rule]]. He is also a traditional deity in [[Daoism]].

Confucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in shaping human history. His teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and remains influential today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life and Significance of Confucius|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/confucius.htm|website=www.sjsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Confucianism: Life of Confucius, Influences, Development|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/religion/confucianism/|website=www.travelchinaguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Etymology|Name|Titles}}

==Name==
The name "Confucius" is a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] "Kǒng Fūzǐ" ({{lang|zh|孔夫子}}, meaning "Master Kong"), and was coined in the late 16th century by the early [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries to China]].{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}} Confucius's clan name&lt;!-- NOT surname, as they had not yet been invented--&gt; was "Kǒng" ({{lang|zh|孔}}; [[Old Chinese]]: {{Old Chinese|kʰˤoŋʔ}}), and his given name was "Qiū" ({{lang|zh|丘}}; OC: {{Old Chinese|kʷʰə}}).  His "capping name", given upon reaching adulthood and by which he would have been known to all but his older family members, was "Zhòngní" ({{lang|zh|仲尼}}; OC: &amp;#42;{{IPA|N-truŋ-s nrəj}}), the "Zhòng" indicating that he was the second son in his family.{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}}{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2015|p=133}}

Confucius was educated at schools for commoners, where he studied and learned the [[Six Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416224536/https://books.google.com/books?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|archivedate=2017-04-16|df=|isbn=9781441196538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius was born into the class of ''[[Four occupations|shi]]'' (士), between the aristocracy and the common people. He is said to have worked in various government jobs during his early 20s, and as a bookkeeper and a caretaker of sheep and horses, using the proceeds to give his mother a proper burial.&lt;ref name=confu/&gt;&lt;ref name=buryl/&gt; When his mother died, Confucius (aged 23) is said to have [[Ancestor veneration in China#Mourning rites|mourned for three years]], as was the tradition.&lt;ref name=buryl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burgan|first1=Michael|title=Confucius: Chinese Philosopher and Teacher|date=2008|publisher=Capstone|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vM8GCpBncjEC&amp;pg=PT12|accessdate=August 12, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416230252/https://books.google.com/books?id=vM8GCpBncjEC&amp;pg=PT12|archivedate=April 16, 2017|df=|isbn=9780756538323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===

In Confucius's time, the state of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] was headed by a ruling ducal house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=274–275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the duke were [[Three Huan|three aristocratic families]], whose heads bore the title of viscount and held hereditary positions in the Lu bureaucracy. The Ji family held the position "Minister over the Masses", who was also the "Prime Minister"; the Meng family held the position "Minister of Works"; and the Shu family held the position "Minister of War". In the winter of 505 BC, Yang Hu—a retainer of the Ji family—rose up in rebellion and seized power from the Ji family. However, by the summer of 501 BC, the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling Yang Hu from Lu.&lt;ref name="dubs49-275"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings, while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness, so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government. Thus, that year (501 BC), Confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town. Eventually, he rose to the position of Minister of Crime.&lt;ref name="dubs49-275-6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city—strongholds belonging to the three families. This way, he could establish a centralized government. However, Confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself. In 500 BC, Hou Fan—the governor of Hou—revolted against his lord of the Shu family. Although the Meng and Shu families unsuccessfully besieged Hou, a loyalist official rose up with the people of Hou and forced Hou Fan to flee to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]]. The situation may have been in favor for Confucius as this likely made it possible for Confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities. Eventually, after a year and a half, Confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the Shu family to raze the walls of Hou, the Ji family in razing the walls of Bi, and the Meng family in razing the walls of Cheng. First, the Shu family led an army towards their city Hou and tore down its walls in 498 BC.&lt;ref name="dubs49-277"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter, Gongshan Furao or Buniu, a retainer of the Ji family, revolted and took control of the forces at Bi.&lt;ref name="creel49-35-6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duuuu46-277-8" /&gt; He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu.&lt;ref name="dubs49-277" /&gt; Earlier, Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him, which Confucius considered. Even though he disapproved the use of a violent revolution, the Ji family dominated the Lu state force for generations and had exiled the previous duke. Although he wanted the opportunity to put his principles into practice, Confucius gave up on this idea in the end.&lt;ref name=creel49-35-6 /&gt; Creel (1949) states that, unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him, Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke.&lt;ref name=creel49-35&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dubs (1946) is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls.&lt;ref name=duuuu46-277-8&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277–278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the situation may have been, Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu, even after he was forced to flee.&lt;ref name=creel49-35 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dubs49-278 /&gt;

During the revolt by Gongshan, Zhong You ({{Lang-zh|c=仲由|s=|t=|labels=no}}) had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court.&lt;ref name=dubs49-278&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhong You was one of the disciples of Confucius and Confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the Ji family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278–279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Confucius heard of the raid, he requested that Viscount Ji Huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the Ji's palace complex and ascended the Wuzi Terrace. Confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels.&lt;ref name="chin07-30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chin|2007|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one of the two officers was a retainer of the Ji family, but they were unable to refuse the orders while in the presence of the duke, viscounts, and court.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt; The rebels were pursued and defeated at Gu. Immediately after the revolt was defeated, the Ji family razed the Bi city walls to the ground.&lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt;

The attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and their lord. Through Confucius's actions, the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official. Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius's foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.&lt;ref name=dubs49-279 /&gt;

When it was time to dismantle the city walls of the Meng family, the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the Meng family not to do so.&lt;ref name=chin07-30 /&gt; The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] and cause the destruction of the Meng family.&lt;ref name="dubs49-279" /&gt; Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt, he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls.&lt;ref name="dubs49-279" /&gt;

Later in 498 BC, Duke Ding personally went with an army to lay siege to Cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground, but he did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Confucius could not achieve the idealistic reforms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280–281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had made powerful enemies within the state, especially with Viscount Ji Huan, due to his successes so far.&lt;ref name=dubs46-281&gt;{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to accounts in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' and ''[[Shiji]]'', Confucius departed his homeland in 497 BC after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful Ji, Meng, and Shu families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riegel|1986|loc=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He left the state of Lu without resigning, remaining in self-exile and unable to return as long as Viscount Ji Huan was alive.&lt;ref name=dubs46-281 /&gt;

===Exile===
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Journey of Confucius.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the journey of Confucius to various states between 497 BC and 484 BC.]]
The ''[[Shiji]]'' stated that the neighboring [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful while Confucius was involved in the government of the Lu state. According to this account, Qi decided to sabotage Lu's reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the duke of Lu. The duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days. Confucius was disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities, yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving. Confucius therefore waited for the duke to make a lesser mistake. Soon after, the duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom, and Confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the Lu state.

After Confucius's resignation, he began a long journey or set of journeys around the [[ancient Chinese states|principality states]] of north-east and central China including [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wey]], [[Song (state)|Song]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Cao (state)|Cao]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Chen (state)|Chen]], and [[Cai (state)|Cai]] (and a failed attempt to go to [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]]). At the courts of these states, he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented.

===Return home===
[[File:Confuciustombqufu.jpg|thumb|200px|Tomb of Confucius in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]], [[Qufu]], [[Shandong Province]]]]

According to the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', Confucius returned home to his native Lu when he was 68, after he was invited to do so by [[Ji Kangzi]], the chief minister of Lu.&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=confucius+return+68+lu#v=onepage&amp;q=confucius%20return%2068%20lu&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 13, 2015|isbn=9781441196538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Analects'' depict him spending his last years teaching 72 or 77 [[disciples of Confucius|disciples]] and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the [[Five Classics]].

During his return, Confucius sometimes acted as an advisor to several government officials in Lu, including [[Ji Kangzi]], on matters including governance and crime.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

Burdened by the loss of both his son and his favorite disciples, he died at the age of 71 or 72. He died from natural causes. Confucius was buried in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]] which lies in the historical part of [[Qufu]] in the Shandong Province.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The original tomb erected there in memory of Confucius on the bank of the Sishui River had the shape of an axe. In addition, it has a raised brick platform at the front of the memorial for offerings such as sandalwood incense and fruit.

==Philosophy==
{{Main article|Confucianism}}
[[File:Dacheng Hall.JPG|thumb|The Dacheng Hall, the main hall of the [[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Qufu]]]]

Although Confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the Chinese, many argue that its values are secular and that it is, therefore, less a religion than a secular morality. Proponents argue, however, that despite the secular nature of Confucianism's teachings, it is based on a worldview that is religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Peter|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|title=Is Confucianism a Religion?|publisher=''The American Interest''|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817062142/http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|archivedate=August 17, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism discusses elements of the [[Diyu|afterlife]] and views concerning [[Tian|Heaven]], but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought, such as the nature of [[Chinese soul|soul]]s. However, Confucius is said to have believed in astrology, saying: "Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly".&lt;ref name="Parkers"&gt;[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rongo Analects 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Analects]] of Confucius]]

In the ''[[Analects]]'', Confucius presents himself as a "transmitter who invented nothing". He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study, and it is the [[Chinese character]] for study ({{linktext|學}}) that opens the text. Far from trying to build a systematic or [[Religious formalism|formalist]] theory, he wanted his disciples to master and internalize older classics, so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events (as recorded in the ''Annals'') or the past expressions of commoners' feelings and noblemen's reflections (as in the poems of the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'').

===Ethics===
One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules. Confucian ethics may, therefore, be considered a type of [[virtue ethics]]. His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument, and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed indirectly, through [[allusion]], [[innuendo]], and even [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. His teachings require examination and context to be understood. A good example is found in this famous anecdote:

::{{lang|zh|廄焚。子退朝，曰：“傷人乎？” 不問馬。}}
::''When the stables were burnt down, on returning from court Confucius said, "Was anyone hurt?" He did not ask about the horses.''
:::::::''Analects'' X.11 (tr. [[Arthur Waley|Waley]]), 10–13 (tr. [[James Legge|Legge]]), or X-17 (tr. [[D.C. Lau|Lau]])

By not asking about the horses, Confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of [[humanism]].

One of his teachings was a variant of the [[Golden Rule]], sometimes called the "[[Silver Rule]]" owing to its negative form:

::{{lang|zh|己所不欲，勿施於人。}}
::''"What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others."''

::{{lang|zh|子貢問曰：“有一言而可以終身行之者乎？”子曰：“其恕乎！己所不欲、勿施於人。”}}
::''Zi Gong [a disciple] asked: "Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?" &lt;br /&gt;The Master replied: "How about 'reciprocity'! Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself."''
:::::::''Analects'' XV.24, tr. David Hinton

Often overlooked in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self: sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge. Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge. A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption, and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness. Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.

The Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in ''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]'' ({{lang|zh|禮}}) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: (a) ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, (b) social and political institutions, and (c) the etiquette of daily behavior. It was believed by some that ''lǐ'' originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of ''lǐ'' through the actions of sage leaders in human history. His discussions of ''lǐ'' seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony.

In the early Confucian tradition, ''lǐ'' was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good. Training in the ''lǐ'' of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when ''lǐ'' must be adapted in light of situational contexts.

In Confucianism, the concept of ''li'' is closely related to ''yì'' ({{lang|zh|義}}), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity. ''Yì'' can be translated as [[righteousness]], though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context. The term contrasts with action done out of [[selfishness|self-interest]]. While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good. Thus an outcome of ''yì'' is doing the right thing for the right reason.

Just as action according to ''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]'' should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to ''yì'', so ''yì'' is linked to the core value of ''rén'' ({{lang|zh|仁}}).''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Rén]]'' consists of 5 basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence and kindness.&lt;ref name="Bonevac09-40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bonevac|Phillips|2009|loc=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rén'' is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as "benevolence" or "humaneness"; translator [[Arthur Waley]] calls it "Goodness" (with a capital ''G''), and other translations that have been put forth include "authoritativeness" and "selflessness." Confucius's moral system was based upon [[empathy]] and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of ''rén'' so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of ''yì''. Confucius asserts that virtue is a mean between extremes. For example, the properly generous person gives the right amount—not too much and not too little.&lt;ref name="Bonevac09-40" /&gt;

===Politics===
Confucius's political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through "rites" (''lǐ'') and people's [[natural morality]], and ''not'' by using bribery and coercion. He explained that this is one of the most important analects: "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good." (Translated by [[James Legge]]) in the [[Great Learning]] ({{lang|zh|大學}}). This "sense of shame" is an internalisation of [[duty]], where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].

Confucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples. In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, he wanted to restore the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|天命}}) that could unify the "world" ({{lang|zh|天下}}, "all under Heaven") and bestow peace and prosperity on the people. Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of [[conservatism]], but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage. These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social [[perfection]], and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.

Confucius did not believe in the concept of "[[democracy]]", which is itself an [[Athens|Athenian]] concept unknown in ancient China, but could be interpreted by Confucius's principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government. He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since not everyone is created equal, not everyone has a right of self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuman|first1=Michael|title=Confucius: And the World He Created|date=2015|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wb6DBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123&amp;lpg=PT123&amp;dq=confucius+everyone+equal#v=onepage&amp;q=confucius%20everyone%20equal&amp;f=false|isbn =978-0465040575|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he supported the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing [[truth]] in language, and [[honesty]] was of paramount importance. Even in [[facial expression]], truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Violatti|first=Cristian|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|title=Confucianism|publisher=''Ancient History Encyclopedia''|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818150049/http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|archivedate=August 18, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius's teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers, who organized his teachings into the Analects.{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}} Confucius's disciples and his only grandson, [[Zisi]], continued his philosophical school after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Focusing the Familiar: A Translation and Philosophical Interpretation of the Zhongyong|author=Ames, Roger T. and David L. Hall|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2001|isbn=9780824824600|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts spread Confucian ideals to students who then became officials in many of the royal courts in China, thereby giving Confucianism the first wide-scale test of its [[dogma]].

Two of Confucius's most famous later followers emphasized radically different aspects of his teachings. In the centuries after his death, [[Mencius]] ({{lang|zh|孟子}}) and [[Xun Zi]] ({{lang|zh|荀子}}) both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius. [[Mencius]] (4th century BC) articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards ''rén'', ''yì'', and ''lǐ'', while [[Xun Zi]] (3rd century BC) underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought, stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training. In time, their writings, together with the ''Analects'' and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism.

This realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which saw filial piety as self-interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state. A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquered all of China. [[Li Si]], Prime Minister of the [[Qin dynasty]], convinced [[Qin Shi Huang]] to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler. When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned—considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship.

Under the succeeding [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. Under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]], the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th century. As [[Mohism]] lost support by the time of the Han,  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of [[Laozi]], whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new [[Buddhist]] religion, which gained acceptance during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era. Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and even the [[Yuan Dynasty]], although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them.

During the [[Song dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130–1200) added ideas from [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death, his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking ''[[Neo-Confucianism]]''. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam until the 19th century.

[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese'', published by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] at Paris in 1687.]]
The works of Confucius were first translated into European languages by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] in the 16th century during the late [[Ming dynasty]]. The first known effort was by [[Michele Ruggieri]], who returned to Italy in 1588 and carried on his translations while residing in [[Salerno]]. [[Matteo Ricci]] started to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and a team of Jesuits—[[Prospero Intorcetta]], [[Philippe Couplet]], and two others—published a translation of several [[Confucian canon|Confucian works]] and an overview of [[history of China|Chinese history]] in Paris in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://archive.org/stream/confuciussinarum00conf_0#page/n5/mode/2up |title=Confucius Sinarum Philosophus, sive, Scientia Sinensis Latine Exposita ''[''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese, or, Chinese Knowledge Explained in Latin'']'' |editor-last=Intorcetta |editor-first=Prospero |editor2=Philippe Couplet |editor3=Chrétien Herdtrich |editor4=François Rougemont |display-editors=1 |ref={{harvid|Intorcetta &amp; al.|1687}} |date=1687 |location=Paris |publisher=Daniel Horthemels }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parker77-25&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1977|loc=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Noël (missionary)|François Noël]], after failing to persuade [[Pope Clement XI|Clement{{nbsp}}XI]] that [[Chinese ancestral veneration|Chinese veneration of ancestors]] and [[Confucianism|Confucius]] [[Chinese Rites controversy|did not constitute idolatry]], completed the Confucian canon at [[Prague]] in 1711, with more scholarly treatments of the other works and the first translation of the [[Mengzi (book)|collected works]] of [[Mencius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Noël |editor-first=François |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=A0K0bjBLmMYC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Sinensis Imperii Libri Classici Sex ''[''The Six Classic Books of the Chinese Empire'']'' |location=Prague |publisher=Charles-Ferdinand University Press |date=1711 }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[western world|Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=parker77-25 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobson|2004|loc=194–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era Confucian movements, such as [[New Confucianism]], still exist, but during the [[Cultural Revolution]], Confucianism was frequently attacked by leading figures in the [[Communist Party of China]]. This was partially a continuation of the condemnations of Confucianism by intellectuals and activists in the early 20th century as a cause of the ethnocentric close-mindedness and refusal of the [[Qing Dynasty]] to modernize that led to the tragedies that befell China in the 19th century.

Confucius's works are studied by scholars in many other Asian countries, particularly those in the [[Chinese cultural sphere]], such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Many of those countries still hold the traditional memorial ceremony every year.

The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] believes Confucius was a [[Prophets of Islam|Divine Prophet]] of God, as were [[Lao-Tzu]] and other eminent Chinese personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ahmad|n.d.|loc=[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_3.html online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[7853 Confucius|Asteroid 7853]], "Confucius", was named after the Chinese thinker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=7853IAU IAU Minor Planet Center].

===Disciples===

{{main article|Disciples of Confucius}}

There is not much known of Confucius's disciples, and a little over half of them had their surnames recorded in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''.&lt;ref name=creel49-30&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Analects]]'' records 22 names that are most likely Confucius's disciples, while the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' records 24 names, although it is quite certain that there have been many more disciples whose name were not recorded.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Most of Confucius's disciples were from the [[Lu (state)|Lu state]], while others were from neighboring states.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; For example, Zigong was from the [[Wey (state)|Wey state]], and Sima Niu was from the [[Song (state)|Song state]].&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Confucius's favorite disciple was Yan Hui, most probably one of the most impoverished of them all.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Sima Niu, in contrast to Yan Hui, was from a hereditary noble family hailing from the Song state.&lt;ref name=creel49-30 /&gt; Under Confucius's teachings, the disciples became well-learned in the principles and methods of government.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; He often engaged in discussion and debate with his students and gave high importance to their studies in history, poetry, and ritual.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; Confucius advocated loyalty to principle rather than to individual acumen, in which reform was to be achieved by persuasion rather than violence.&lt;ref name=creel49-32&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Confucius denounced them for their practices, the aristocracy was likely attracted to the idea of having trustworthy officials who were studied in morals as the circumstances of the time made it desirable.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; In fact, the disciple Zilu even died defending his ruler in Wei.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt;

Yang Hu, who was a subordinate of the Ji family, had dominated the Lu government from 505 to 502 and even attempted a coup, which narrowly failed.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; As a likely consequence, it was after that that the first disciples of Confucius were appointed to government positions.&lt;ref name=creel49-32 /&gt; A few of Confucius's disciples went on to attain official positions of some importance, some of which were arranged by Confucius.&lt;ref name=creel49-31&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Confucius was 50 years old, the Ji family had consolidated their power in the Lu state over the ruling ducal house.&lt;ref name=creel49-33&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Ji family had practices with which Confucius disagreed and disapproved, they nonetheless gave Confucius's disciples many opportunities for employment.&lt;ref name=creel49-33 /&gt; Confucius continued to remind his disciples to stay true to their principles and renounced those who did not, all the while being openly critical of the Ji family.&lt;ref name=creel49-32-3&gt;{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual portraits===
No contemporary painting or sculpture of Confucius survives, and it was only during the [[Han Dynasty]] that he was portrayed visually. Carvings often depict his legendary meeting with [[Laozi]]. Since that time there have been many portraits of Confucius as the ideal philosopher. The oldest known portrait of Confucius has been unearthed in the tomb of the [[Han dynasty]] ruler [[Marquis of Haihun]] (died 59 BC). The picture was painted on the wooden frame to a polished bronze mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0221/57185.html |title=Confucius depicted on mirror |date= |language=English |website=The Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences |accessdate=22 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222200723/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0221/57185.html |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In former times, it was customary to have a portrait in [[Temple of Confucius|Confucius Temple]]s; however, during the reign of [[Hongwu Emperor]] (Taizu) of the [[Ming dynasty]], it was decided that the only proper portrait of Confucius should be in the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|temple]] in his home town, [[Qufu]] in Shandong. In other temples, Confucius is represented by a memorial tablet. In 2006, the China Confucius Foundation commissioned a standard portrait of Confucius based on the [[Tang dynasty]] portrait by [[Wu Daozi]].

===Memorials===
[[File:First Entrance Gate of the Temple of Confucius, Ching-hai.jpg|thumb|left|First entrance gate of the [[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Zhenhai]]]]

Soon after Confucius's death, [[Qufu]], his home town, became a place of devotion and remembrance. The [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' records that it had already become a place of pilgrimage for ministers. It is still a major destination for cultural tourism, and many people visit his grave and the surrounding temples. In Sinic cultures, there are many temples where representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Laozi]], and Confucius are found together. There are also many [[Temple of Confucius|temples]] dedicated to him, which have been used for Confucian ceremonies.

Followers of Confucianism have a tradition of holding spectacular memorial ceremonies of Confucius ({{lang|zh|祭孔}}) every year, using ceremonies that supposedly derived from Zhou Li ({{lang|zh|周禮}}) as recorded by Confucius, on the date of Confucius's birth. In the twentieth century, this tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland China, where the official stance of the Communist Party and the State was that Confucius and Confucianism represented reactionary [[Feudalism|feudalist]] beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] is a part of the natural order. All such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned. Only after the 1990s did the ceremony resume. As it is now considered a veneration of Chinese history and tradition, even Communist Party members may be found in attendance.

In Taiwan, where the Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) strongly promoted Confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior, the tradition of the memorial ceremony of Confucius (祭孔) is supported by the government and has continued without interruption. While not a national holiday, it does appear on all printed calendars, much as [[Father's Day]] or [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] do in the Western world.

In [[South Korea]], a grand-scale memorial ceremony called [[Seokjeon Daeje]] is held twice a year on Confucius's birthday and the anniversary of his death, at [[Hyanggyo|Confucian academies]] across the country and [[Sungkyunkwan]] in Seoul.

===Descendants===
{{See also|Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent}}

Confucius's descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility and official posts. They were honored with the rank of a [[marquess|marquis]] thirty-five times since [[Gaozu of Han|Gaozu]] of the [[Han dynasty]], and they were promoted to the rank of [[duke]] forty-two times from the [[Tang dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] first bestowed the title of "Duke Wenxuan" on Kong Suizhi of the 35th generation. In 1055, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] first bestowed the title of "[[Duke Yansheng]]" on Kong Zongyuan of the 46th generation.

During the [[Southern Song dynasty]], the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou in Zhejiang, while the newly established [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/en/B10.pdf |title=Descendants and Portraits of Confucius in the Early Southern Song  |accessdate=2016-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913134503/http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/en/B10.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas2.asian-studies.org/absts/1995abst/china/csess45.htm |title=AAS Abstracts: China Session 45 |first=B.

In [[1351]], during the reign of Emperor [[Toghon Temür]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]], 93rd-generation descendant Kong Huan (孔浣)'s 2nd son Kong Shao (孔昭) moved from China to Korea during the [[Goryeo|Goryeo Dynasty]], and was received courteously by [[Queen Noguk|Princess Noguk]] (the Mongolian-born wife of the future king [[Gongmin of Goryeo|Gongmin]]). After being naturalized as a Korean citizen, he changed the [[hanja]] of his name from "昭" to "紹" (both pronounced ''so'' in Korean),&lt;ref&gt;Due to a [[naming taboo]] regarding the birth name of the 4th king of Goryeo [[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Gwangjong]], born "Wang So" ({{Korean|왕소|王昭}}).&lt;/ref&gt; married a Korean woman and bore a son (Gong Yeo ({{Korean|공여|孔帤}}), 1329–1397), therefore establishing the Changwon Gong clan ({{Korean|창원 공씨|昌原 孔氏}}), whose ancestral seat was located in [[Changwon]], [[South Gyeongsang Province]].
The clan then received an [[Korean nobility|aristocratic rank]] during the succeeding [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.qz.gov.cn/English/Recent/201405/t20140519_278510.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150204113943/http://www.qz.gov.cn/English/Recent/201405/t20140519_278510.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-02-04|title=Descendants of Confucius in South Korea Seek Roots in Quzhou|date=2014-05-19|website=QUZHOU.CHINA|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/90001/90777/90851/6355971.html|title=South Korea home to 80,000 descendants of Confucius - People's Daily Online|first=|last=english@peopledaily.com.cn|website=en.people.cn|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828231834/http://en.people.cn/90001/90777/90851/6355971.html|archivedate=2016-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16696029_4.htm|title=New Confucius Genealogy out next year -- china.org.cn|website=www.china.org.cn|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010172506/http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16696029_4.htm|archivedate=2016-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2016-03/11/content_37999541.htm|title=China Exclusive: Korean Confucius descendants trace back to ancestor of family tree - China.org.cn|website=www.china.org.cn|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601040417/http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2016-03/11/content_37999541.htm|archivedate=2016-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-03/11/c_135179011.htm|title=China Exclusive: Korean Confucius descendants trace back to ancestor of family tree |website=www.news.xinhuanet.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729171433/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-03/11/c_135179011.htm|archivedate=2016-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794, during the reign of King [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]], the clan then changed its name to [[Qufu Kong clan|Gokbu Gong clan]] ({{Korean|곡부 공씨|曲阜 孔氏}}) in honor of Confucius's birthplace [[Qufu]] ({{ko-hhrm|곡부|曲阜|Gokbu}}), [[Shandong Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=|date=|title=Doosan Encyclopedia 공 孔|publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]]|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1062982&amp;cid=200000000&amp;categoryId=200000185&amp;mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famous descendants include actors such as [[Gong Yoo]] (real name Gong Ji-cheol (공지철)) &amp; [[Gong Hyo-jin]] (공효진); and artists such as male idol group [[B1A4]] member [[Gongchan]] (real name Gong Chan-sik (공찬식)), singer-songwriter [[Minzy]] (real name Gong Min-ji (공민지)), as well as her great-aunt traditional folk dancer [[:ko:공옥진|Gong Ok-jin]] (공옥진).

Despite repeated dynastic change in China, the title of Duke Yansheng was bestowed upon successive generations of descendants until it was abolished by the [[Nationalist Government]] in 1935.

Because of the huge interest in the Confucius family tree, there was a project in China to test the DNA of known family members of the collateral branches in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ministry of Commerce of the PRC|2006|loc=[http://ye2.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/chinanews/200606/20060602462372.html online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, this would allow scientists to identify a common Y chromosome in male descendants of Confucius. If the descent were truly unbroken, father-to-son, since Confucius's lifetime, the males in the family would all have the same Y chromosome as their direct male ancestor, with slight mutations due to the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/171840.htm | title=DNA Testing Adopted to Identify Confucius Descendants | publisher=China Internet Information Center | date=19 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the genetic test was the help members of collateral branches in China who lost their genealogical records to prove their descent. However, in 2009, many of the collateral branches decided not to agree to DNA testing.&lt;ref name=seedmagazine&gt;{{Harvnb|Qiu|2008|loc=[http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/inheriting_confucius/ online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Sykes]], professor of genetics at Oxford University, understands this decision: "The Confucius family tree has an enormous cultural significance," he said. "It's not just a scientific question."&lt;ref name=seedmagazine /&gt;  The DNA testing was originally proposed to add new members, many of whose family record books were lost during 20th-century upheavals, to the Confucian family tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bandao|2007|loc=[http://eng.bandao.cn/newsdetail.asp?id=4644 online]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main branch of the family which fled to Taiwan was never involved in the proposed DNA test at all.

In 2013 a DNA test performed on multiple different families who claimed descent from Confucius found that they shared the same Y chromosome as reported by Fudan University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Chen |first= Stephen |date= 13 November 2013 &lt;!-- 3:00am --&gt; |title= Study finds single bloodline among self-claimed Confucius descendants |url= http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1354787/study-finds-single-bloodline-among-self-claimed-confucius |newspaper= South China Morning Post |location=  |access-date=  |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150403044929/http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1354787/study-finds-single-bloodline-among-self-claimed-confucius |archivedate= 3 April 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage''' is a [[UNESCO]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 17 October 2003. The convention entered into force in 2006, after thirtieth instruments of ratification by UNESCO Member States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, 178 states have ratified, approved or accepted the convention.&lt;ref name = ratifications&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=17116&amp;language=E States Parties to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Layout of the Convention===
The Convention contains following provisions:

I. General Provisions

II.  Organs of the Convention

III.  Safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage at the national level

IV. Safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage at the international level

V.  International cooperation and assistance

VI.  Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund

===Purposes of the Convention===

Unlike other UNESCO conventions, this convention begins with stating its purposes, which are;
{{quote|(a)	to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage;
(b)	to ensure respect for the intangible cultural heritage of the communities, groups and individuals concerned;

(c)	to raise awareness at the local, national and international levels of the importance of the intangible cultural heritage, and of ensuring mutual appreciation thereof;
(d)	to provide for international cooperation and assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Definition===
{{Main|Intangible cultural heritage}}

Intangible cultural heritage refers to "traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants, such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe or the knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01851-EN.pdf What is Intangible Cultural Heritage] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention defines it as follows:

{{quote|Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, and skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 2
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Function===
The Convention works on both national and international levels.
At the national level, State Parties are supposed to ‘take necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage present in its territory.” These measures include identification of the intangible cultural heritage that exists in its territory, adoption of appropriate policies, promotion of education and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 11&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, in taking these measures, each state parties must “endeavor to ensure the widest possible participation of communities, groups, and, where appropriate, individuals that create, maintain and transmit such heritage, and to involve them actively in its management”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 15&lt;/ref&gt;

At the international level, this Convention promotes international cooperation, which includes “the exchange of information and experience, joint initiatives, and the establishment of a mechanism of assistance” to other State Parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lists'''

The Committee to the Convention publishes and keeps up to date two lists of intangible cultural heritage, which are
*the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]]
*the [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 16,17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund'''

The Convention establishes Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund, the use of which is decided by the Committee. The fund mainly consists of the contributions by State Parties and funds by the General Conference of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
One of the first international occasions that mentioned the preservation of 'intangible heritage' was the World Conference on Cultural Policies in Mexico City in 1982.&lt;ref name="Working towards the 2003 Convention"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.6&lt;/ref&gt; This Conference defined cultural heritage as including “both tangible and intangible works through which the creativity of people finds expression,” and asked UNESCO and Member States to take measures for protecting this kind of heritage.&lt;ref name="Working towards the 2003 Convention"/&gt;

In 1989, UNESCO adopted the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore as the first legal instrument towards the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.7&lt;/ref&gt; This Recommendation reflected the ideas of the earlier Conference in Mexico City. UNESCO conducted some promotional programs for raising awareness of this Recommendation, but was not very successful.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; However, in the late 90's, there was a conference held for the assessment of this Recommendation, which pointed out some problems to be considered in drafting the Convention. In this sense, this Recommendation served as an important step.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, UNESCO launched the program of Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, intending to raise awareness of the importance of intangible heritage. This program proclaimed a total of 90 masterpieces between 2001 and 2005, and caused the movement toward the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00103 Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity (2001–2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===

According to the request of Member States, a preliminary study, undertaken by Director-General, on how could the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage be conducted, recommended to create a new document that set an international standard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2001, the General Conference adopted another instrument, [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]], which also includes articles dealing with the preservation of ’heritage in all forms’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13179&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity] Article 7&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration and its Action Plan presented basic idea of the coming convention and helped to develop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of many meetings for two years, the draft Convention was brought into the General Conference and adopted in 2003.

==Criticism==
*The definition of intangible cultural heritage has been criticized as potentially incomplete. For example, in a 2004 article in ''[[Museum International]]'', [[Richard Kurin]] says that because the Convention does not recognize cultural activities not compatible with international human rights instruments, some activities, such as [[female genital mutilation]], that groups may themselves consider critical to their culture, are not eligible. Similarly, Kurin notes that since many group's culture is defined in opposition to other cultures, the requirement for "mutual respect" may leave out traditional songs and stories that glorify "empire, victorious kings, religious conversion, or alternatively resistance to perceived injustice, martyrdom and defeat".&lt;ref name=Kurin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurin|first=Richard|title=Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in the 2003 UNESCO Convention: a critical appraisal|journal=Museum International|date=1 May 2004|volume=56|issue=1–2|pages=66–77|doi=10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kurin also notes that the definition can be more expansive than intended by its designers, who originally planned only to protect "traditional cultural activities". He says that it is robust enough to encompass more modern forms of culture, including things like "[[rap music]], [[Australian cricket]], modern dance, post-modernist architectural knowledge, and [[karaoke bars]]".&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt;
*Richard Kurin has argued that dividing culture into individual units is inconsistent with modern academic views of cultures.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt; Additionally, Michael Brown has argued that Convention's focus on cataloging is based on an outdated belief that listing the details of a culture has some connection to preservation of that culture.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Michael F.|title=Heritage Trouble: Recent Work on the Protection of Intangible Cultural Property|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2005|volume=12|issue=01|doi=10.1017/S0940739105050010|url=http://lanfiles.williams.edu/~mbrown/Brown,%20Heritage%20Trouble,%20IJCP,%202005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; States are also encouraged to enact programs to safeguard intangible cultural heritages, though any such work must be done in cooperation with the local practitioners. This aspect has also been criticized, since it is unclear how a state can safeguard a cultural practice by force, particularly if there is insufficient interest from local practitioners.&lt;ref name =Kurin/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">'''Criminal tradition''' - of the cultural transmission of criminal values. Criminal traditions are transmitted from the older generation to the younger generation, such as social customs are in other forms of society.

Studies of the criminal tradition involved  Clifford R. Shaw and Henry D. McKay. They put forward a theory of “cultural transmission”, focuses on the development in some urban neighborhoods of a criminal tradition that persists from one generation to another despite constant changes in population. This theory stresses the value systems of different areas

Also worth noting theory of “differential association,” in which  Edwin H. Sutherland described the processes by which criminal values are taken over by the individual. Edwin H. Sutherland asserted that criminal behavior is learned and that it is learned in interaction with others who have already incorporated criminal values.&lt;ref&gt;Criminology Theory: Selected Classic Readings, by Frank P. Williams III, Marilyn D. McShane&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Shaw and McKay on the concept of cultural transmission indicates that a criminal tradition or subculture does exist in areas of  larger cities.  According to their studies Criminal tradition arises and is maintained in areas of instability, and the values, norms, and behaviors of the participants in the criminal tradition are viewed as normal by these people.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn J. R. Subcultures, violence, and the subculture of violence: An old rut or a new road? //Criminology. – 1971. – Т. 9. – №. 1. – С. 87-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population categories subject to criminal traditions ==

Traditions are not personified, so adolescents and boys are easier to obey than direct instructions from specific individuals. This is the power of tradition. The norms of the life of groups in which the will of their members manifest themselves take the form of tradition most often. In the tradition that there is no personification, adolescents find it easier to obey them than to a particular person. Against this background, the criminal traditions that are prevalent in youth criminal groups, especially in closed educational and correctional institutions are especially dangerous. In a criminal environment, there are two kinds of traditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* They came to us from the criminal environment of the distant past and transformed into modern ones, taking into account the conditions of life of society and the relations dominating in it;
* New traditions that have arisen and established in a criminal environment in modern conditions and have no analogues in the past.

At the same time, there is a transformation of existing criminal traditions and the emergence of new ones. The reason for this is the changes in the social, economic, legal and other spheres.

== World criminal tradition ==

On the criminal tradition in different countries of the world, there is a huge amount of work. There is an impressive number of works on the Russian criminal tradition, written in different languages. 
We can also highlight works by Jonny Steinberg on [[The Numbers Gang|the numbers gangs]] of South Africa

== Alternative opinions ==

There is also the view that it is impossible to consider all the traditions of the criminal environment as antisocial and harmful, including, for the reason that some of the traditions in the cells of the remand center, contribute to hygiene and the maintenance of sanitary norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian criminal tradition == 

In Russian criminal tradition adherents of the criminal (criminal) tradition are characterized by active participation in the life of the "thieves' community"; Living on tangible assets obtained by criminal means; Propaganda of "thieves' customs and traditions, as well as criminal way of life; Compulsion to keep a word not only before the "brother", but also the criminal-criminal world; Organization of collection of "obschekovyh" funds and control over their use; Guardianship and assistance to detainees and convicts, the so-called "vagabonds" and "honest prisoners"; Compliance with the decisions of "gatherings"; Demanding of "brotherhood" and control over their compliance; Organization of counteraction to state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulit.me/books/cvetnaya-mast-elita-prestupnogo-mira-read-10956-1.html ВМЕСТО ПРЕДИСЛОВИЯ "ВОРЫ В ЗАКОНЕ" — ИСТОРИЯ ПРОБЛЕМЫ] RuLit&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Daughter from California" syndrome''' is a phrase used in the [[Medicine|medical profession]] to describe a situation in which a long-lost distant relative arrives at the hospital at which a dying elderly relative is being treated, and insists that the medical team pursue aggressive measures to prolong the patient's life, or otherwise challenges the care the patient is being given. In his 2015 book ''[[The Conversation: A Revolutionary Plan for End-of-Life Care]]'', American doctor [[Angelo Volandes]] ascribes this to "guilt and denial," "not necessarily what is best for the patient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volandes|first1=Angelo|title=The Conversation: a Revolutionary Plan for End-of-Life Care.|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=[S.l.]|isbn=1620408546|pages=60–61}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The "daughter from California" is often described as angry, articulate and informed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychiatry: Clinical Cases Uncovered|last = Byrne|first = Nicola|publisher = Wiley|year = 2008|isbn = 9781405159838|location = |pages = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical professionals say that because the "daughter from California" has been absent from the life and care of the elderly patient, he or she is frequently surprised by the scale of the patient's deterioration, and may have unrealistic expectations about what's medically feasible. He or she may feel guilty about having been absent, and may therefore feel motivated to reassert his or her role as an involved caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruera|first1=edited by Russell K. Portenoy, Eduardo|title=Topics in Palliative Care|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195102452|page=317}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was first documented by [[David Molloy]] and other [[Gerontology|gerontologists]] in a 1991 case report published in the ''[[Journal of the American Geriatrics Society]]'', titled "Decision Making in the Incompetent Elderly: 'The Daughter from California Syndrome'." In the paper, Molloy and colleagues presented strategies intended to help medical staff deal with the difficult family members of mentally incompetent patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Youngner|first1=edited by Maurice D.

In California, the "daughter from California" is known as the "daughter from New York."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Thomas Grisso, Paul S.|title=Assessing competence to consent to treatment: a guide for physicians and other health professionals|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195103726|page=159}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Discrimination based on skin color''', also known as '''colorism''' or '''shadeism''', is a form of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] in which people are treated differently based on the social meanings attached to [[Human skin color|skin color]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = Trina | year = 2001 | title = Shades of Brown: The Law of Skin Color | url = | journal = Duke Law Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 1487 | pages = | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.233850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination based on skin color in [[criminal justice]], [[business]], the [[Economic discrimination|economy]], [[housing]], [[health care]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[politics]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Lighter skin tones are seen as preferable in many countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]].

==Asia==

=== East and South Asia ===
In [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], a preference for lighter skin is prevalent, especially in countries such as&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/13/asia.whitening/|title=Skin Deep: Dying to be White|date=2002-05-15|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Korea]], [[India]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.H.|first=Li, Eric|last2=Jeong|first2=Min, Hyun|last3=W.|first3=Belk, Russell|date=2008-01-01|title=Skin Lightening and Beauty in Four Asian Cultures|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/13415/volumes/v35/NA-35|journal=NA - Advances in Consumer Research| volume = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2016/01/dark-what-behind-india-s-obsession-skin-whitening|title=In the dark: what is behind India’s obsession with skin whitening?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of [[skin whitening]] in East Asia dates far back to ancient times. In the ancient dynastic eras, to be light in an environment in which the sun was harsh implied wealth and nobility because those individuals were able to remain indoors while servants had to labor outside.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt; Ancient Asian cultures also associated light skin with feminine beauty. "Jade" white skin in Korea is known to have been the ideal as far back as the [[Gojoseon|Gojoseon era]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Japan's [[Edo period]] saw the start of a trend of women whitening their faces with rice powder as a "moral duty".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Chinese women valued a "milk white" complexion and swallowed powdered pearls towards that end.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Four out of ten women surveyed in [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[South Korea]] use a skin whitening cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-03-30/skin-whitening-big-business-asia|title=Skin whitening big business in Asia|date=30 March 2009|publisher=Public Radio International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many Asian cultures, colorism is taught to children in the form of fairy tales, just as the Grimms' fairy tales featured light-skinned princesses or maidens; Asian mythological protagonists are typically fair and depict virtue, purity, and goodness. A light complexion is equated with feminine beauty, racial superiority, and power, and continues to have strong influences on marital prospects, employment, status, and income.&lt;ref name="Verma2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Verma, Harsh| title=Skin 'fairness'-Culturally Embedded Meaning and Branding Implications| journal=Global Business Review| volume=12| issue=2| year=2011| pages=193–211| url=http://gbr.sagepub.com/content/12/2/193.abstract| doi=10.1177/097215091101200202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalized East Asia still retains these biases, but they are compounded by the influence of Westernized beauty ideals and media that equate whiteness with modern and urban wealth and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Framing the Bride: Globalizing Beauty and Romance in Taiwan's Bridal Industry|last=Adrian|first=Bonnie|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=0-520-23833-8|location=|pages=147–179|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacies of European colonialism in India and Pakistan also influence the modern relations between light skin and power.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====India====

It was mistakenly thought by Western scholars that the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] represents demonic powers and ugliness and, as a dark-skinned goddess (whose name translates to "she who is black"), is therefore a demonstration of Indian colorism. This, however, was later understood to not be true, as Kali is actually traditionally viewed positively and seen as a symbol of sexuality, motherly love, violence, and [[Shakti|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Kali/|title=Kali|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also remain plenty of examples of black being exemplified as holy as with Shiva and the most well known and popular [[Dashavatara|avatars]] of the god Vishnu, [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]]. More recently, this was understood to have been a strategy by British colonial powers to subjugate Indian civilization.

Colorism in India has also been fueled due to the events under British colonial rule, where British officials consistently demeaned dark-skinned Indians and favored light-skinned Indians for jobs over dark-skinned Indians.&lt;ref name="cmc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/keck-center/asia-experts-forum/radhika-parameswaran-on-colorism-in-india|title=Radhika Parameswaran on 'colorism' in India|website=cmc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of hundreds of years of British colonial influence, remnants of the British tactics that exacerbated colorism still remain in Indian society.&lt;ref&gt;Savita Malik, The Domination of Fair Skin: Skin Whitening, Indian Women and Public Health, San Francisco State University Department of Health Education (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of colorism in India can be seen in the cosmetic industry, where "fairness" creams meant to lighten skin are popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairandlovely.in|title=header test|website=fairandlovely-in}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Bollywood industry, where the majority of actors and actresses hired are light-skinned, and actresses are often photoshopped to look lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/aug/14/indias-dark-obsession-fair-skin|title=India's unfair obsession with lighter skin|first=Monisha|last=Rajesh|date=14 August 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the state of [[Maharashtra]], a group of young tribal girls trained to be flight crew through a government scholarship program that aimed to empower women. The majority of girls were denied employment due to their darker skin tone. A few of those women obtained jobs, but only as out-of-sight ground crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Impact of Colorism on the Career Aspirations and Career Opportunities of Women in India|journal=[[Advances in Developing Human Resources]]|volume=18|issue=I|pp=38–53|doi=10.1177/1523422315616339|year=2015 | last1 = Sims | first1 = Cynthia | last2 = Hirudayaraj | first2 = Malar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
Skin-lightening creams are popular in Pakistan, especially among women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetempest.co/2016/04/20/social-justice/colorism-was-the-bane-of-my-existence/|title=Colorism ruined my life growing up in Pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ads feature light-skin models in good light while portraying dark-skinned models poorly.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/mmw/2013/01/pakistan-a-country-of-one-color/|title=Pakistan: A Country of One Color?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood, which largely features light skinned Indian actors, is also influential among Pakistanis.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

==== Sri Lanka ====
Fair skin is a beauty ideal in contemporary Sri Lankan society but has its roots in ancient Sri Lankan beauty ideals. Fairness products and other products that include whitening agents are commonly sold in Sri Lanka and are popular among females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Fair-skin-obsession-An-inferiority-complex-that-needs-treatment-123403.html|title=Fair  skin  obsession: An inferiority complex that needs treatment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair skinned actors and actresses feature prominently in [[Bollywood]] films and [[Korean drama]]s both of which are widely popular and influential in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=1850|title=How the Korean Soap Opera Influence Sri lankan’s Life|first=Shyama|last=Jinasena|date=1 September 2014|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Human Movement and Sports Sciences|volume=2|issue=5|doi=10.13189/saj.2014.020502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://djedpress.com/2018/07/31/unfairandlovely-in-sri-lanka/|title=When Fair isn’t fair and Lovely isn’t lovely in Sri Lanka - Djed|date=31 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China and Japan ====
Hiroshi Wagatsuma writes in [[Daedalus (journal)|''Daedalus'']] that Japanese culture has long associated [[Human skin color|skin color]] with other physical characteristics that signify degrees of spiritual refinement or of primitiveness.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The scholar repeats an old Japanese proverb: "white skin makes up for seven defects."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; More specifically for a woman, very light skin allows people to overlook her lack of other desired physical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Skin color has and continues to influence attractiveness and socioeconomic status and capability.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

People in the western hemisphere have long characterised east Asians, specifically Chinese and Japanese people, as "yellow", but the Chinese and Japanese seldom describe their skin color in that way.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The Japanese traditionally used the word ''shiroi'' – meaning "white" – to describe the lighter shades of skin in their society.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The court ladies of Japan during the [[Nara period]] from 710 to 793 AD applied a large amount of white powder to the face and added red rosy cheeks.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Many references to plump women with [[White Skin|white skin]] appear in both drawings and writings from 794–1186 AD.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In literature, note for example ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (written {{circa}} 1000–1012) by [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
A survey concluded that three quarters of Malaysian men thought their partners would be more attractive if they had lighter skin complexions.&lt;ref name="Skin Deep: Dying to be White" /&gt;

In certain Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, a common beauty ideal is the "[[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian look]]" known locally in Malaysia as the "pan-Asian look" is an ideal that stems from the beauty ideal of fair skin, which Eurasians tend to naturally possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1053286/miss-universe-malaysia-pageant-contestants-look-too-western|title=Miss Universe Malaysia pageant contestants 'look too western'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overuse of pan-Asian faces on billboards and on television screens has been a controversial issue in the country. The issue was highlighted in 2009 when [[Zainuddin Maidin]], a Malaysian politician, called for the reduction of pan-Asian faces which he claimed dominate TV and billboards and instead increase the number of Malay, Chinese and Indian faces on local television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2007-02/09/content_805345.htm|title=Malaysian ads move triggers industry row|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy surrounding the preference for Malaysians who are of mixed Asian (Malay, Chinese or Indian) and European descent who possess features such as fair skin, some experts in the industry have said the use of pan-Asian faces can be used to promote the racial diversity of Malaysians. They can also be used to promote a product towards a diverse racial demographic because of their mixed appearance, which the Minister of Information had suggested in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqIzh1StFiwC&amp;pg=PA153|title=Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World|first=Steven|last=Kemper|date=1 May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States ==
===History===
[[European colonialism]] created a system of [[white supremacy|racial hierarchy]] and race-based [[ideology]], which had led to a structure of domination that privileged whites over blacks. Biological differences in skin color were used as a justification for the enslavement and oppression of Africans and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]; developing a social hierarchy that placed whites at the top and blacks at the bottom, with the exception of "[[white trash]]", who were considered lower than blacks. Slaves with lighter complexion were allowed to engage in less strenuous tasks, like domestic duties, while the darker slaves participated in hard labor, which was more than likely outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = Mark E | year = 2002 | title = Skin Color and the Perception of Attractiveness Among African Americans: Does Gender Make a Difference? | url = | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 77–91 | doi=10.2307/3090169| jstor = 3090169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; African American with a partial white heritage were seen to be smarter and superior to dark-skinned blacks, giving them broader opportunities for education and the acquisition of land and property.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., Wilson, M., &amp; Hall, R. (1993). The color complex: The politics of skin color among African Americans. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorism was a device used by the white colonist in order to create a division between the Africans and further the idea that being as close to white as possible was the ideal image. One of the first forms of colorism was the white slave owners deciding that only the light skinned slaves would work in the house while the darker ones were subjected to the harsh conditions of the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fultz|first=Lauren|date=Summer 2017|title=THE PSYCHO-SOCIAL IMPACT OF COLORISM AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN: CROSSING THE DIVIDE|url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1909&amp;context=etd_all|journal=Psychology Commons|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a clear division between the slaves There were tests to determine who was light enough to work in the house and sometimes get special privileges. One of these tests was the [[Brown Paper Bag Test|brown paper bag test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/question/2014/february.htm|title=Brown Paper Bag Test - 2014 - Question of the Month - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's skin was darker than a brown paper bag, they were deemed too dark to work in the house. The skin tests were not just used by white people trying to differentiate between black people, but also by the black people themselves. In addition to the bag test, the comb test and the door test were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://askmeaboutmyhair.com/testing-blackness/|title=Testing Blackness - Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|date=2014-02-10|work=Ask Me About My Hair (.com)|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comb test was used to measure the kinkiness of the persons hair. The objective was for the comb to be able to pass through the hair without stopping. The door test was very popular at some African American clubs and churches. The people in charge would paint the door a certain shade of brown, similar to the bag test, and if you were darker than the door, you were not allowed admittance into the establishment. These tests were used to measure what level of "blackness" was and was not acceptable for the world. Because the lighter slaves were allowed to work in the house, they were more likely to be educated than the darker slaves.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This birthed the stereotype that dark people were stupid and ignorant.

Analysis of more than 20 million traffic stops in North Carolina showed that blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police for traffic stops, and that blacks were more likely to be searched following the stop. There were no significant difference in the likelihood that Hispanics would be pulled over, but Hispanics were much more likely to be searched following a traffic stop than whites.

The phrase "brown paper bag test," also known as a [[paper bag party]], along with the "ruler test" refers to a ritual once practiced by certain African-American sororities and fraternities who would not let anyone into the group whose skin tone was darker than a paper bag.&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;Kerr, A. E. (2006). The paper bag principle: Class, colorism, and rumor in the case of black Washington, DC.

Skin color discrimination in education affects individuals in different ways depending on gender. This may be due to the disparity in standards of attractiveness, to which women are held much more closely than men. White women, previously thought to be in a group that did not experience discrimination based on skin color, have been shown to be affected by this inequality. A 2013 study used [[spectrophotometer]] readings to quantify skin color of respondents. White women experience discrimination in education, with those having darker skin graduating from college at lower rates than those with lighter skin. This precise and repeatable test of skin color revealed that white women experience skin color discrimination in education at levels consistent with African-Americans. White men are not affected in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Branigan|first1=Amelia|last2=Freese|first2=Jeremy|last3=Patir|first3=Assaf|last4=McDade|first4=Thomas|last5=Liu|first5=Kiang|last6=Kiefe|first6=Catarina|title=Skin color, sex, and educational attainment in the post-civil rights era|journal=Social Science Research|date=November 2013|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1659–1674|pmid=24090859|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 ProPublica analysis found that African Americans and Native Americans were underrepresented in clinical trials for new drugs. Fewer than 5% of patients were African-American, even though they make up 13.4% of the total US population.

Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas ([[Racial steering|steering]]); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white.

A 2017 paper by Troesken and Walsh found that pre-20th century cities "created and sustained residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity." However, "when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s" whites started "lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances."

A 2017 study found that minorities receive a lower boost to earnings from legal education than whites and were less likely to practice law. However, it is difficult to determine the extent to which this is the result of racial discrimination.&lt;ref name="Race"/&gt; The differences in earnings premiums appears to have diminished in recent years.

Research suggests that light-skinned African American women have higher salaries and greater job satisfaction than dark-skinned women.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = Margaret | year = 2002 | title = 'If You're Light You're Alright': Light Skin Color as Social Capital for Women of Color | url = | journal = Gender and Society | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 175–93 | doi=10.1177/08912430222104895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being "too black" has recently been acknowledged by the U.S. Federal courts in an employment discrimination case under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

===Media===
A 2017 report by Travis L. Dixon (of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) found that major media outlets tended to portray black families as dysfunctional and dependent while white families were portrayed as stable. These portrayals may give the impression that poverty and welfare are primarily black issues. According to Dixon, this can reduce public support for social safety programs and lead to stricter welfare requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/13/news-media-offers-consistently-warped-portrayals-of-black-families-study-finds/|title=News media offers consistently warped portrayals of black families, study finds|last=Jan|first=Tracy|date=2017-12-13|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://colorofchange.org/dangerousdistortion/|title=Report: A Dangerous Distortion of our Families|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans possessing lighter skin complexion and "European features," such as lighter eyes, and smaller noses and lips have more opportunities in the media industry. For example, film producers hire lighter-skinned African Americans more often, television producers choose lighter skinned cast members, and magazine editors choose African American models that resemble European features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodard | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Traumatic Shame: Toni Morrison, Televisual Culture, and the Cultural Politics of the Emotions | url = | journal = Cultural Critique | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 210–240 | doi=10.2307/1354414| jstor = 1354414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the magazine industry, African American women are rarely showcased in the most popular magazines.[https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1437&amp;context=etds] Therefore, African American girls have difficultly identifying with the models showcased in these magazines, because they do not represent the type of women that they come into contact with in their own communities. Recent studies have indicated that the number of racially biased advertisements in magazines have increased over the years. A content analysis conducted by Scott and Neptune (1997) shows that less than one percent of advertisements in major magazines featured African American models. When African Americans did appear in advertisements they were mainly portrayed as athletes, entertainers or unskilled laborers. In addition, seventy percent of the advertisements that features animal print included African American women. Animal print reinforces the stereotypes that African Americans are animalistic in nature, sexually active, less educated, have lower income, and extremely concerned with personal appearances.&lt;ref name=Pious&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pious | first1 = Scott | last2 = Neptune | first2 = Dominique | year = 1997 | title = Racial and Gender Biases in Magazine Advertising: A Content-Analytic Study | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 627–644 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning African American males in the media, darker skinned men are more likely to be portrayed as violent or more threatening, influencing the public perception of African American men. Since dark-skinned males are more likely to be linked to crime and misconduct, many people develop preconceived notions about the characteristics of black men.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|title=The bleaching syndrome: African American's response to cultural domination vis-A-vis skin color|url=|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=26|issue=2|pages=172–184|doi=10.1177/002193479502600205|last1=Hall|first1=R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorism was and still is very much evident in the media. An example of this is shown in the [[minstrel show]]s that were popular during and after slavery. Minstrel shows were a very popular form of theater that involved white and black people in black face portraying black people while doing demeaning things. The actors painted their faces with black paint to and over lined their lips with bright red lipstick to exaggerate and make fun of black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/jackson/minstrel/minstrel.html|title=The Minstrel Show|website=chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When minstrel shows died out and television became popular, black actors were rarely hired and when they were, they had very specific roles. These roles included being servants, slaves, idiots, and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Punyanunt|first=Narissa|date=|title=The Perceived Realism of African American Portrayals on Television|url=|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; White people wanted to keep this narrative going that black people were forever in debt to them because they essentially rescued blacks from themselves and made them humans instead of savages. This is seen in the "mammy" role that black women often played. The highlights of this role included black women being the loyal servant to the master and taking care of and loving his kids more than her own. Even though black people were allowed to be on TV, they still couldn't be too black. They had to pass the color tests and if they were dark, they were usually playing a humiliating role. That trend is something that follows into present day especially for women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} There is a huge absence of dark black women in the media and when they are shown, they are typically portraying the angry black woman stereotype but have a light skinned character to balance them out. Darker women are rarely the protagonist that isn't troubled by drugs, or caught up in the legal system. There is also a large absence of representation of dark women in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://colorismhealing.org/colorism-in-hip-hop/|title=Colorism in Hip Hop: Keeping it Real|last=Webb|first=Sarah|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of affection in music videos are women who could have easily passed the paper bag test and many entertainers have gone on record saying that they don't girls who are too dark and that they only prefer light or white women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Kate|last2=Dixon|first2=Travis L.|last3=Zhang|first3=Yuanyuan|date=2009-02-27|title=Controversial Rap Themes, Gender Portrayals and Skin Tone Distortion: A Content Analysis of Rap Music Videos|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08838150802643795?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|language=en|volume=53|issue=1|pages=134–156|doi=10.1080/08838150802643795|issn=0883-8151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that white voters' voting behavior is motivated by racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that white Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans displaced. This suggest that white voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enos|first=Ryan D.|date=2016-01-01|title=What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior |journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=123–142|doi=10.1111/ajps.12156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voter ID laws in the United States|Voter ID laws]] have brought on accusations of racial discrimination.

A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws are more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino white name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Ariel R.|last2=Nathan|first2=Noah L.|last3=Faller|first3=Julie K.|date=2015-02-01|title=What Do I Need to Vote?

According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to black and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs.

Whites also gave governors more responsibility for state improvements than they gave Obama for national ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=David C.|last2=Davis|first2=Darren W.|date=2018|title=Appraisals of President Obama's economic performance: Racial resentment and attributional responsibility|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0261379418300362|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=55|pages=62–72|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2018.08.002|issn=0261-3794|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study examining "all 24 African American challengers (non-incumbents) from 2000 to 2014 to white challengers from the same party running in the same state for the same office around the same time" found "that white challengers are about three times more likely to win and receive about 13 percentage points more support among white voters. These estimates hold when controlling for a number of potential confounding factors and when employing several statistical matching estimators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tokeshi|first=Matthew|date=2018-08-28|title=Why are African American Governors and U.S. Senators so Rare?

===Beauty===
Studies have shown that due to societal influences, people associate beauty with lighter skin. This is especially evident in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naacpldf.org/brown-at-60-the-doll-test|title=Brown at 60: The Doll Test {{!}} NAACP LDF|website=www.naacpldf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has led dark-skinned children to feel inadequate in who they are and inferior when compared to people with lighter skin.

'''Education''' is the process of facilitating [[learning]], or the acquisition of [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, [[values]], [[belief]]s, and [[habit (psychology)|habits.]] Educational methods include [[storytelling]], [[discussion]], [[teaching]], [[training]], and directed [[research]]. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also [[autodidacticism|educate themselves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The methodology of teaching is called [[pedagogy]].

Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as [[preschool]] or [[kindergarten]], [[primary school]], [[secondary school]] and then [[college]], [[university]], or [[apprenticeship]].

A [[right to education]] has been recognized by some governments and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="ICESCR-art13.1"&gt;Article 13 of the [[United Nations]]' 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognizes a universal right to education. ''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions, education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] up to a certain age.

==Etymology==
[[Etymologically]], the word "education" is derived from the Latin ''[[wikt:en:educatio#Latin|ēducātiō]]'' ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēducō]]'' ("I educate, I train") which is related to the [[homonym]] ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ''[[wikt:en:e-#Latin|ē-]]'' ("from, out of") and ''[[wikt:en:duco#Latin|dūcō]]'' ("I lead, I conduct").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate].

Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-[[Literacy|literate]] societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their [[knowledge]] beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs | author=Assmann, Jan | year=2002 | page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' published in 1607]]

[[Plato]] founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of [[Ancient Greece]]. There, the great [[Library of Alexandria]] was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), of the [[State of Lu]], was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150325-confucius-china-asia-philosophy-communist-party-ngbooktalk/|title=Why Is Confucius Still Relevant Today?

The [[Aztecs]] also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in [[Nahuatl]] called ''tlacahuapahualiztli.'' It means "the art of raising or educating a person"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Education through Dance and Ceremony: A Mexica Palimpsest|last=Colin|first=Ernesto|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=9781349470945|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind|last=León-Portilla|first=Miguel|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0806105697|location=Norman|pages=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living.

After the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages|title=Science owes much to both Christianity and the Middle Ages : Soapbox Science|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church established [[cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1088, the [[University of Bologne]] is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.&lt;ref&gt;Nuria Sanz, Sjur Bergan: "The heritage of European universities", 2nd edition, Higher Education Series No. 7, Council of Europe, 2006, ISBN, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] which was established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.

[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations&amp;nbsp;– as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like [[Euclid's Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for European audiences. [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.

In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or [[homeschooling|otherwise]], is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30&amp;nbsp;years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity''].

==Formal education==
Formal education occurs in a [[learning environment|structured environment]] whose explicit purpose is teaching [[student]]s. Usually, formal education takes place in a [[school]] environment with [[classroom]]s of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most [[Educational management|school systems]] are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, [[school organizational models|organizational models]], design of the physical [[learning space]]s (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/started/what/formal.html|title = Enhancing Education|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|title =Perspectives Competence Centre, Lifeling Learning Programme|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141015103040/http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|archivedate =15 October 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preschool===
[[File:Parent's day at Eirfan's Kindergarten.jpg|thumb|Young children in a [[kindergarten]] in Japan]]
{{Main|Early childhood education}}
Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter [[primary education]]. These are also known as [[nursery schools]] and as [[kindergarten]], except in the US, where kindergarten is a term often used to describe the earliest levels of primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecs.org/kindergarten-policies/|title=50-State Comparison: State Kindergarten-Through-Third-Grade Policies|website=www.ecs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindergarten "provide[s] a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary===
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|Primary school students with their teacher, [[Colombia]], 2014]]
{{Main|Primary education}}
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].

In India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].

===Secondary===

In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minors]], to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], "postsecondary", or "[[Higher education|higher]]" education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.

Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada, and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].

Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[High school (North America)|high schools]] were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.

Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.

[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.

===Tertiary (higher)===

[[File:Michelle Obama speaking at Peking university.jpg|thumb|Universities often host prominent guest speakers for student audiences, e.g. [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]] delivering remarks at [[Peking University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.

University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the [[graduate student|graduate]] (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Some universities are composed of several colleges.

One type of university education is a [[liberal arts]] education, which can be defined as a "[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: ''Britannica Concise Encyclopædia''| work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63–71 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv | doi =10.2307/1975506}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[liberal arts college]]" is more commonly associated with institutions in the [[United States]] such as [[Williams College]] or [[Barnard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocational===
[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|Carpentry is normally learned through [[apprenticeship]] with an experienced carpenter]]
{{Main|Vocational education}}

[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].

===Special===
{{Main|Special education}}
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by [[physicians]] or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.&lt;ref name="Credo Reference"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other educational forms==

===Alternative===
{{Main|Alternative education}}
While considered "alternative" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. [[Alternative education]] developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of [[traditional education]]. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including [[alternative school]]s, [[autodidacticism|self learning]], [[homeschooling]], and [[unschooling]]. Example [[alternative school]]s include [[Montessori method|Montessori schools]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] (or [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] schools), [[List of Friends Schools|Friends schools]], [[Sands School]], [[Summerhill School]], [[Walden's Path]], [[The Peepal Grove School]], [[Sudbury Valley School]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti schools]], and [[open classroom]] schools. [[Charter school]]s are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535992.pdf|title = Federal Investment in Charter Schools|date = October 2011|accessdate = 2 October 2015|website = Institute of Education Sciences|publisher = Center for American Progress|last = Lazarin|first = Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/charter-schools_n_4419341.html|title = Charter Schools Continue Dramatic Growth Despite Controversies|date = 10 December 2013|accessdate = 2 October 2015|newspaper = The Huffington Post|last = Resmovits|first = Joy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as [[Friedrich Fröbel]]'s approach to [[early childhood education]] in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary [[kindergarten]] classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]; the [[United States|American]] [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]] [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; the founders of [[educational progressivism|progressive education]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; and educational pioneers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]], and more recently [[John Caldwell Holt]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Frederick Mayer]], [[George Dennison]], and [[Ivan Illich]].

===Indigenous===
[[File:Schoolyard essay2.JPG|thumb|alt=Na Schoolyard.|[[Indigenous education|Teaching indigenous knowledge]], models, and methods in [[Yanyuan County]], [[Sichuan]], China]]
{{Main|Indigenous education}}
[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author1=May, S.  |author2=Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139–45|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning===
{{main|Informal learning}}
'''Informal learning''' is one of three forms of learning defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at [[home]], [[employment|work]], and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.  For many learners, this includes [[language acquisition]], [[cultural norm]]s, and [[manners]].

In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner.  If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.&lt;ref name=Rogoff&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0091732X16680994 | volume=40 | title=The Organization of Informal Learning | year=2016 | journal=Review of Research in Education | pages=356–401 | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Callanan | first2 = Maureen | last3 = Gutiérrez | first3 = Kris D. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139519526.028 | title=Informal Learning in Museums | journal=The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences | pages=461–478 | last1 = Crowley | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Pierroux | first2 = Palmyre | last3 = Knutson | first3 = Karen| year=2014 | isbn=9781139519526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While informal learning often takes place outside educational [[school|establishments]] and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations. Educators can structure their lessons to directly utilize their students informal learning skills within the education setting.&lt;ref name=Rogoff/&gt;

In the late 19th century, education through play began to be recognized as making an important contribution to child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GH | last =Mead | title = The Relation of Play to Education| journal = University Record| year =1896| pages =141–45 | volume =1 | url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1896.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GE | last =Johnson | title = Education through recreation| publisher = Cleveland Foundation, Ohio| year =1916|  url=https://archive.org/stream/educationthrough00johnuoft#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L.P. Jacks]], also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title = Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative| journal = Anat Sci Educ| year =2012| pages =165–70 | volume =5 |pmid=22434649 | doi=10.1002/ase.1273 | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1175&amp;context=vivianmcalister&amp;type=additional | last2 =Bodrogi | first2 =Andrew | last3 =Cristea | first3 =Octav | last4 =Johnson | first4 =Marjorie | last5 =McAlister | first5 =Vivian C. | issue =3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"/&gt;

===Self-directed learning===
{{Main|Autodidacticism}}
[[Autodidacticism]] (also autodidactism) is a term used to describe self-directed learning. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director), and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).

===Open education and electronic technology===
{{main|Open education|Educational technology}}

Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] teaming up to form [[edX]]. Other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennylvania]], and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as well as notable public universities including [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua]], [[Peking University|Peking]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Michigan]], and [[University of Virginia]].

Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurobonkers.com/2012/08/02/the-single-biggest-change-in-the-way-we-learn-since-the-printing-press/ |title=Free courses provided by Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington |publisher=Neurobonkers.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harriet Swain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/01/university-campuses-decline-elearning-students? |title=Will university campuses soon be 'over'?  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-10-24 |location=London |date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, ElsabeÂ. "Electronic Education System Model." Department of Computer Science and Information Systems in South Africa, 17 Oct. 2000. Web. 3 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some [[open universities]] do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "[[Academic capital|academic value]]" to traditional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree?  |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=M. |date=2010 |title=Such a Deal? Maybe Not. Online learning can cost more than traditional education. |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |volume=57 |issue=11 |url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Such-a-Deal-Maybe-Not/125103/ |subscription=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent meta-analysis found that online and blended educational approaches had better outcomes than methods that used solely face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education sector ==
[[File:北师大西门.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing Normal University]], which is governed directly by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]], is an example of collaboration between different entities in the education sector]]
The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people ([[curriculum]] developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as [[Education policy|education policies]] and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with a large number of stakeholders and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders involved in health, [[child protection]], justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Several UN agencies have asserted that [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] should be integrated into school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development goals==
[[File:Education index UN HDR 2007 2008.PNG|thumb|World map indicating [[Education Index]] (according to 2007/2008 [[Human Development Report]])]]

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda includes 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), including SDG 4 on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals|last=|first=|publisher=UN|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.

[[Universal Primary Education]] is one of the eight international [[Millennium Development Goals]], towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Liesbet Steer and Geraldine Baudienville 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4755&amp;title=funding-basic-education What drives donor financing of basic education?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Additionally, [[Transparency International]] has identified [[political corruption|corruption]] in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Addis Ababa |url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |title=Poor governance jeopardises primary education in Africa |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627021316/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |archive-date=27 June 2010 |website=Transparency International |date=23 February 2010 |access-date=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. There is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A study conducted by the [[UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning]] indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite report |last=de Grauwe |first=A. |date=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO-IIPE |url=http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |title=Capacity development strategies |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505082915/http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
* plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
* a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).

===Internationalization===
Nearly every country now has [[Universal Primary Education]].

Similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European Socrates-[[Erasmus]] Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitates exchanges across European universities. The [[Soros Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations.

===Education and technology in developing countries===
[[File:OLPC Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in [[Haiti]]]]
{{Main|Education and technology}}

Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and [[developing countries]]. Charities like [[One Laptop per Child]] are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

The [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC foundation]], a group out of [[MIT Media Lab]] and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a [[$100 laptop]] for delivering [[educational software]]. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

In Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an "[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabuur.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021011082942/http://www.nabuur.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-10-11 |title=nabuur.com |publisher=nabuur.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.

[[India]] is developing technologies that will bypass land-based [[telephone]] and Internet infrastructure to deliver [[distance learning]] directly to its students. In 2004, the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] launched [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]], a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |title=EDUSAT |publisher=[[ISRO]] |accessdate=2013-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227162328/http://isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |archivedate=27 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private vs public funding in developing countries===
Research into LCPS (low-cost private schools) found that over 5 years to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving [[Education for All]] (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=65993|title=Low-cost private schools: evidence, approaches and emerging issues|publisher=Eldis|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable.
The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:
* Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
* Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.
* Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.
* Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.

The report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programs; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.

{{main|Educational theory}}

===Educational psychology===
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of [[school]]s as [[organization]]s. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].
[[File:2013. Донецк 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).

===The intelligence–education relationship===
{{Main|Psychology of education}}
[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = S. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = H. | last3 = Sheppard | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Seven year longitudinal study of the early prediction of reading achievement | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 349–61 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.77.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. | last2 = Reinert | first2 = G. | year = 1969 | title = Cohort effects in cognitive development in children as revealed by cross sectional sequences | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 169–77 | doi=10.1037/h0026997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = M. | last2 = Sacker | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Lifetime Antecedents of Cognitive Reserve | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 614–24 | doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.614.14581| pmid = 12815499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning modalities===
There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:&lt;ref&gt;Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., &amp; Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.

Other commonly employed modalities include [[music]]al, [[interpersonal]], [[Verbal reasoning|verbal]], [[logical]], and [[intrapersonal]].

Dunn and Dunn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningstyles.net/ |title=Dunn and Dunn |publisher=Learningstyles.net | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as [[Joseph Renzulli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/renzulli.shtml |title=Biographer of Renzulli |publisher=Indiana.edu | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended varying teaching strategies. [[Howard Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences&lt;/ref&gt; identified a wide range of modalities in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] and [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]], based on the works of [[Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keirsey.com/ |title=Keirsey web-site |publisher=Keirsey.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of [[David Kolb]] and [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Type Delineator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |title=Type Delineator description |publisher=Algonquincollege.com |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301064219/http://algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; follows a similar but more simplified approach.

Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Barbe, W. B., &amp; Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |title=Learning modality description from the Learning Curve website |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404234142/http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |archivedate=4 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that [[learning styles]] such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref name="titleGuy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/49-whats-the-point-of-school |title=Guy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School?|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Learner%20Responsibility.pdf | title = Learner Responsibility in Management Education, or Ventures into Forbidden Research (with Comments) | author = J.

[[Educational neuroscience]] is an emerging [[science|scientific]] field that brings together researchers in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]], [[educational psychology]], [[educational technology]], [[education theory]] and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education.&lt;ref name = AnsariCoch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ansari | first1 = D | authorlink1 = | last2 = Coch | first2 = D | year = 2006 | title = Bridges over troubled waters: Education and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 146–51 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2006.02.007 | pmid = 16530462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = CochAnsari&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coch | first1 = D | authorlink1 = | last2 = Ansari | first2 = D | year = 2008 | title = Thinking about mechanisms is crucial to connecting neuroscience and education | journal = Cortex | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–47 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2008.06.001 | pmid = 18649878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Goswami2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goswami | first1 = U | year = 2006 | authorlink1 = | title = Neuroscience and education: from research to practice? | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 406–11 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1907 | pmid = 16607400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = MeltzoffScience09&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = AN | authorlink1 = | last2 = Kuhl | first2 = PK |last3 = Movellan | first3 = J | last4 = Sejnowski |first4 = TJ | year = 2009 | title =  Foundations for a New Science of Learning | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5938 | pages = 284–88 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175626 | pmc = 2776823 | pmid = 19608908| bibcode = 2009Sci...325..284M | citeseerx = 10.1.1.165.1628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the [[neural]] mechanisms of [[Reading (process)|reading]],&lt;ref name = Goswami2006 /&gt; [[numerical cognition]],&lt;ref name = AnsariNRN08&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ansari | first1 = D | authorlink1 = | year = 2008 | title = Effects of development and enculturation on number representation in the brain | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience| volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 278–91 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2334 | pmid = 18334999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[attention]], and their attendant difficulties including [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref name=McCandlissNoble&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCandliss | first1 = BD | authorlink1 =  | last2 = Noble | first2 = KG | year = 2003 | title = The development of reading impairment: a cognitive neuroscience model | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disability Research Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 196–204 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.10080 | pmid = 12953299 | url = https://sacklerinstitute.org/cornell/people/bruce.mccandliss/publications/publications/McCandliss.Noble.2003.pdf | access-date = 24 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827201638/http://www.sacklerinstitute.org/cornell/people/bruce.mccandliss/publications/publications/McCandliss.Noble.2003.pdf | archive-date = 27 August 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all | citeseerx = 10.1.1.587.4158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = GabrieliScience09&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gabrieli | first1 = JD | year = 2009 | authorlink1 = | title = Dyslexia: a new synergy between education and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5938 | pages = 280–83 | doi = 10.1126/science.1171999 | pmid = 19608907| bibcode = 2009Sci...325..280G | url = http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~tsoule/neuro508/Gabrieli_2009_Dyslexia.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.472.3997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dyscalculia]],&lt;ref name = Price2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = GR | last2 = Holloway | first2 = I | last3 = Räsänen | first3 = P | last4 = Vesterinen | first4 = M | last5 = Ansari | first5 = D | year = 2007 | title = Impaired parietal magnitude processing in developmental dyscalculia | journal = Current Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 24 | pages = R1042–43 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.013 | pmid = 18088583| bibcode = 1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ADHD]] as they relate to education. Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.

===Philosophy===
[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]]'s work ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' was written in 1693 and still reflects traditional education priorities in the Western world.]]
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
As an academic field, philosophy of education is "the philosophical study of education and its problems&amp;nbsp;(...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of [[philosophy]]".&lt;ref name=NoddingsPOE&gt;{{Cite book | last = Noddings| first = Nel| title = Philosophy of Education| publisher = Westview Press| year = 1995| location = Boulder, CO| isbn = 978-0-8133-8429-0|page=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Frankena | first1 = William K. | last2 = Raybeck | first2 = Nathan | last3 = Burbules | first3 = Nicholas | contribution = Philosophy of Education | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition | editor-last = Guthrie | editor-first = James W. | place = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan Reference | isbn= 978-0-02-865594-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of [[applied philosophy]], drawing from fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[axiology]] and the philosophical approaches ([[speculative philosophy|speculative]], prescriptive or [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]]) to address questions in and about [[pedagogy]], [[education policy]], and [[curriculum]], as well as the process of [[learning theory (education)|learning]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Noddings|1995|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between [[education theory]] and practice.

===Purpose of education===
There is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Winch and John Gingell, ''Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts'' (2nd edition). London:Routledge, 2008. pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}
In formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

An [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university – or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821105825/http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/default.htm |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational institutions may incorporate [[fine arts]] as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at [[college]]s and universities as electives.  The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/standards/national/arts/index.shtml |title=Fine Arts |publisher=Education World |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sudbury Valley School]] offers a model of education without a curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Scott |date=2011 |title=Sherlock Holmes was Wrong. |journal=The Sudbury Valley School Journal |volume=40 |issue=2 |url=https://sudburyvalley.org/essays/sherlock-holmes-was-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction===
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called [[teacher]]s, and they direct the education of [[student]]s and might draw on many [[course (education)|subjects]] like [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[history]]. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called [[teacher]]s, instructors, or [[professor]]s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Marcus |title=Teachers Matter: Rethinking How Public Schools Identify, Reward, and Retain Great Educators |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=160 |isbn=978-1-4422-1077-6|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |title=How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927092821/http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 |website=mckinsey.com |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J. Scott Armstrong |journal=Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

College basketball coach [[John Wooden]] the Wizard of Westwood would teach through quick "This not That" technique. He would show (a) the correct way to perform an action, (b) the incorrect way the player performed it, and again (c) the correct way to perform an action. This helped him to be a responsive teacher and fix errors on the fly. Also, less communication from him meant more time that the player could practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coyle |first1=Daniel |title=The Talent Code |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-80684-7 |page=159|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics of education==
{{Main|Economics of education}}
[[File:Students, Hakha, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|right|Students on their way to school, [[Hakha]], [[Chin State]], [[Burma|Myanmar]]]]
It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eric A. Hanushek|title=Economic outcomes and school quality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=na7rAAAACAAJ|accessdate=21 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|isbn=978-92-803-1279-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However, [[technology transfer]] requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of "[[human capital]]". Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Daron Acemoglu |author2=Simon Johnson |author3=James A.

At the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of [[Jacob Mincer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacob Mincer|title=The distribution of labor incomes: a survey with special reference to the human capital approach|jstor=2720384|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume= 8|issue=1|year=1970|pages=1–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. This work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;David Card, "Causal effect of education on earnings," in ''Handbook of labor economics'', Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (Eds). Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1999: pp. 1801–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James J. Heckman, Lance J. Lochner, and Petra E. Todd., "Earnings functions, rates of return and treatment effects: The Mincer equation and beyond," in ''Handbook of the Economics of Education'', Eric A. Hanushek and Finis Welch (Eds). Amsterdam: North Holland, 2006: pp. 307–458.&lt;/ref&gt; Some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high [[intelligence quotient]], may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://som.yale.edu/news/2009/11/why-high-iq-doesnt-mean-youre-smart|title=Why a high IQ doesn't mean you're smart|date=2009-11-01|work=Yale School of Management|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Samuel Bowles|author2=Herbert Gintis|title=Schooling In Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcpLPKOL6XYC|accessdate=21 October 2011|date=18 October 2011|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1-60846-131-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future of education==

Many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oph.fi/english/curricula_and_qualifications/basic_education/curricula_2014|title=Finnish National Agency for Education - Curricula 2014|website=www.oph.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. Adults need it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/for-many-people-flexibility-at-work-can-be-a-liberation-matthew-taylor-chief-executive-royal-society-of-arts/|title=For many people, flexibility at work can be a liberation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory lifelong education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/compulsory-education-last-lifetime/|title=Could compulsory education last a lifetime? - Sitra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elegant decay''' is the cultural agreement that some places, and structures, become gradually more elegant, notable, or beautiful as they decay, or fall into [[ruin]], due to their historical, architectural, or cultural significance. Although such reverence is subjective, it is true that certain cities, regions or even countries are more susceptible to the general concept due to past opulence, or their lengthy or enduring history or culture.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Rome Palatine Hill.jpg|thumb|360px|The path to the summit of [[Palatine Hill]], [[Rome]], Italy]]

Contrary to the general interpretation that places or structures are more noteworthy in their newness, or older structures hold more value and interest after being historically restored to their original state, the concept of elegant decay is that in the slow degradation of the structures an inherent elegance, or beauty, emerges due to past historic importance. In recent times, this concept has been exploited by those seeking to stimulate tourism.

==History==
[[File:Venice Windows.jpg|thumb|360px|A wall in [[Venice]], Italy, slowly crumbles into a canal.]]

With its rich history, and centuries of past prestige and prominence, [[Western Europe]] has many places where elegant decay is notable and celebrated. One of the most salient is Italy, due to its lengthy historic prominence in prehistoric, ancient, medieval, and modern times. The most celebrated of Italian cities in elegant decay is arguably [[Venice]], largely due to the whole city slowly crumbling and sinking into its lagoon.{{CN|date=October 2017}}

Although Western Europe holds many instances of elegant decay today, the New World also has places of crumbled reverence as well. Most notable in the United States may be the city and region around [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], with its historic fusion of cultures and important contributions to American expansion. In the concept of elegant decay, there sometimes appears to be an element of impending doom to such places and structures, as Venice slowly sinks, and New Orleans is under constant threat from hurricanes.

Elegant decay is different in concept and plan than [[ruin value]], in which structures are planned to look beautiful as ruins from the early planning stages. The concept of elegant decay is related to the concept of [[patina]].

'''Fashion''' is a popular [[style (disambiguation)|style]], especially in [[clothing]], [[footwear]], [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], [[makeup]], [[hairstyle]] and body.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which people present themselves.

Because the more technical term ''costume'' is regularly linked{{by whom|date=July 2018}} to the term "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like [[Costume party|fancy-dress]] or [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] wear, while the word "fashion" often refers to clothing, including the study of clothing.  Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are [[androgynous]].&lt;ref&gt;Undressing Cinema: Clothing and identity in the movies – Page 196, [[Stella Bruzzi]] – 2012

High-flying [[trendsetter]]s in fashion can aspire to the label ''[[haute couture]]''. But if one disapproves of a fashion, one can attempt to dismiss it as a mere [[fad]].

==Clothing fashions==
{{Main|History of Western fashion}}

Early Western travelers, traveling whether to  India, Persia, Turkey or China, would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion in those countries. The Japanese ''[[shōgun]]''{{'}}s secretary bragged (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that [[Japanese clothing]] had not changed in over a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is considerable evidence in [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]] of rapidly changing fashions in [[Han Chinese clothing|Chinese clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]]: "[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]" (University of California Press 1999); this has a whole section on fashion.&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval [[Caliphate]], followed by a long period without major changes. In 8th-century [[Moorish Spain]], the musician [[Ziryab]] introduced to [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Salim al-Hassani|al-Hassani]], Woodcok and Saoud (2004), ''Muslim Heritage in Our World'', FSTC publishing, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|Bias source per discussions at RS noticeboard|failed=y|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Terrasse, H.

Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], who introduced clothing styles from [[Central Asia]] and the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: A–K|author=Josef W. Meri &amp; Jere L. Bacharach|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2006|isbn=0415966914|page=162}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated. Historians, including [[James Laver]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the [[1300–1400 in fashion|14th century]],&lt;ref&gt;Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="braudel"&gt;Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life", p317, William Collins &amp; Sons, London 1981''&lt;/ref&gt; though they tend to rely heavily on contemporary imagery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashion in Medieval France|last=Heller|first=Sarah-Grace|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|year=2007|isbn=9781843841104|location=Cambridge; Rochester, N.Y.|pages=49–50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and illuminated manuscripts were not common before the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=CMvTkgVRYvMC&amp;pg=PA28|title=English Medieval Narrative in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries|last=Boitani|first=Piero|date=1986-07-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521311496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks,&lt;ref name="conceitom.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceitom.com.br/jeans/#more-1226|title=Jeans Calças Modelos Ideais|date=19 November 2014|work=Conceito M.|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419063504/http://www.conceitom.com.br/jeans/#more-1226|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger. This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers and one of the popular historical fashion was Often referred to as the "Plume Boom," the popularity of wearing real feathers in hats reached its peak in the early 20th century. According to The Smithsonian, women adorned their hats with feathers, wings, and even full taxidermied birds. This caused a huge decline in the bird population, and even led to the exinction of some. Often referred to as the "Plume Boom," the popularity of wearing real feathers in hats reached its peak in the early 20th century. According to The Smithsonian, women adorned their hats with feathers, wings, and even full taxidermied birds. This caused a huge decline in the bird population, and even led to the exinction of some. 

The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien Régime]] [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 317–324&lt;/ref&gt; Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites – a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 313–315&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht Dürer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice. The Venetian lady's high [[chopine]]s make her look taller.]]&lt;!-- This image is referenced in the article. Please don't remove.--&gt;

In the 16th century, national differences were at their most pronounced.  Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats. [[Albrecht Dürer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The "Spanish style" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 317–321&lt;/ref&gt;

Though different  textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks''.&lt;/ref&gt; the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were largely derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles such as the "Steinkirk" [[cravat]] or necktie.

[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion. Her choices, such as this 1783 white [[muslin]] dress called a ''chemise a la Reine'', were highly influential and widely worn.&lt;ref name=dam&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribeiro|first=Aileen|title=Dress and Morality |year=2003 |publisher=Berg |isbn=9781859737828 |pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and [[Abraham Bosse]] had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s, the pace of change picked up in the 1780s with increased publication of French engravings illustrating the latest Paris styles. By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.&lt;ref&gt;James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

Although tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry certainly led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is normally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first true ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by government for the fashion houses that met the standards of industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers and also old fashion is becoming trendy nowadays but with a trendy taste .&lt;ref&gt;Claire B. Shaeffer (2001).

Taunton Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the idea of the [[fashion designer]] as a celebrity in his or her own right has become increasingly dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkins|first1=Ilya|title=Poiret, Dior and Schiaparelli: Fashion, Femininity and Modernity.|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=9780857853288|page=10|edition=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kT-Xcu-aWxQC&amp;pg=PA10|chapter=Introduction: Reputation, Celebrity and the "Professional" Designer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of unisex dressing originated in the 1960s when designers such as [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[Rudi Gernreich]] created garments, such as stretch jersey tunics or leggings, meant to be worn by both males and females. The impact of unisex expands more broadly to encompass various themes in fashion including androgyny, mass-market retail, and conceptual clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Jennifer. "Unisex Clothing".

Some men's styles blended the sensuality and expressiveness despite the conservative trend, the growing gay-rights movement and an emphasis on youth allowed for a new freedom to experiment with style, fabrics such as wool crepe, which had previously been associated with women's attire was used by designers when creating male clothing.&lt;ref&gt;"Clothing for Men".

The four major current [[fashion capital]]s are acknowledged to be Paris, Milan, New York City, and London, which are all headquarters to the greatest fashion companies and are renowned for their major influence on global fashion. [[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.

Modern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a wide number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their personal style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.

One can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)

In recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lemire, B., &amp; Riello, G (2008).

The notion of global fashion industry is a product of the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the mid-19th century, most clothing was [[Made to measure|custom-made]]. It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century—with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores—clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.

Although the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fashion industry consists of four levels:

# the production of raw materials, principally fibers and textiles but also leather and fur.
# the production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.
# retail sales
# various forms of advertising and promotion

These levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors are Textile Design and Production, [[Fashion Design]] and Manufacturing, Fashion Retailing, Marketing and Merchandising, [[Fashion Show]]s, and Media and Marketing. Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296476/Fashion-design-and-manufacturing, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296477/Fashion-retailing-marketing-and-merchandising, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296479/Media-and-marketing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion trend ==
{{main|Fashion trend|2010s in fashion}}
Fashion trends are influenced by several factors including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative explorations, political, economical, social and technological. Examining these factors is called a [[PEST analysis]]. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine growth or decline of a particular trend. Fashion trends change daily, it can not stay unchanged

=== Political influences ===
[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to US President and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzo Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]

Not only did political events make a huge impact on fashion trends but also the political figure played a critical role in forecasting the fashion trend. For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress or a soft color Cassini coat with huge buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s the economy had become wealthier, divorce rate was increasing and government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring miniskirt has become a major fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.

Moreover, political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trend. For instance, during Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie and it is still affecting current fashion trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political &amp; Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology influences ===

Technology plays a large role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.

Developments such as wearable technology have become an important trend in fashion and will continue with advances such as clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and [[E-textiles|smart fabrics]] that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apparel.edgl.com/news/Top-6-Tech-Trends-in-the-Fashion-Industry94135|title=Top 6 Tech Trends in the Fashion Industry|last=Communications|first=Edgell|website=apparel.edgl.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fashion industry is seeing how [[3D printing]] technology has influenced designers such as [[Iris van Herpen|Iris Van Herpen]] and [[Kimberly Ovitz]]. These designers have been heavily experimenting and developing 3D printed couture pieces. As the technology grows, the 3D printers will become more accessible to designers and eventually consumers, which could potentially shape the fashion industry entirely.

Internet technology such as online retailers and social media platforms have given way for trends to be identified, marketed and sold immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Wang|first2=Huchen|title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management|volume=20|issue=4|pages=487–506|doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Styles and trends are easily conveyed online to attract the trendsetters. Posts on Instagram or Facebook can easily increase awareness about new trends in fashion, which subsequently may create high demand for specific items or brands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thinkrunway.com/2013/09/the-impact-of-technology-on-fashion.html|title=The Impact of Technology on Fashion Today|website=Site Name|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310132948/http://www.thinkrunway.com/2013/09/the-impact-of-technology-on-fashion.html|archivedate=2016-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; new "buy now button" technology can link these styles with direct sales.

[[Machine vision]] technology has been developed to track how fashions spread through society. The industry can now see the direct correlation on how fashion shows influence street-chic outfits. The effects can now be quantified and provide valuable feedback to fashion houses, designers and consumers regarding trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/541091/how-machine-vision-is-about-to-change-the-fashion-world/|title=How Machine Vision Is About to Change the Fashion World|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military technology has played an important role in the fashion industry. The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s and camouflage fabric was introduced to street wear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then. Camouflage started to appear in high fashion by the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com|title=Home : Berg Fashion Library|website=www.bergfashionlibrary.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers such as Valentino, Dior and Dolce &amp; Gabbana combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear collections.

=== Social influences ===
[[File:Britney Europe.jpg|thumb|upright|Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have popularised the concept of wearing [[underwear as outerwear]].]]
[[File:Gabriel Garko and Laura Torrisi - nicogenin - 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) - The Road (3).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Red carpet fashion]]: Italian actors [[Gabriel Garko]] and [[Laura Torrisi]] wearing designer [[formal wear]] at [[Venice Film Festival]], 2009]]

Clothing is much more than fashion, it is a style of life an expression of ones self. Social media is one of the biggest platforms to exhibit and connect fashion trends with millions of people all at once worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/social-media-influences-fashion|title=Social Media Influences on Fashion|work=Social Media Today|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion trend goes beyond the aesthetic values, it emerges as an expressive tool for designers to deliver their message about the society. With the influence of social media, celebrities and bloggers, their voice are easily being heard and have impact on fashion and trend at any time.
Fashion and music are inseparable. [[Prabal Gurung]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.notjustalabel.com/editorial/music-and-fashion|title=Music and Fashion|website=www.notjustalabel.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the importance of music to his shows, saying "each season we want to tell a story for 10 minutes…. the perfect harmony between cloths and music allows this". Music is a representation of fashion that expresses the abstract design concept into relatable harmony for viewers.

Fashion relates to social and cultural context of an environment. According to Matika,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/does-pop-culture-influence-fashion/|title=Does pop culture influence fashion?|website=www.sundaynews.co.zw|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music…like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives." Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video ‘Formation’ by Beyoncé, according to Carlos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/|title=The Fashion in Beyoncé's New Video Is as Powerful as Its Politics|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|website=Vogue|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyoncé catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once. Atop a New Orleans police car in a red-and-white Gucci high-collar dress and combat boots, she sits among the ruins of Hurricane Katrina, immediately implanting herself in the biggest national debate on police brutality and race relations in modern day."

Runway show is a reflection of fashion trend and a designer's thought. For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway show is a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water,&lt;ref name="Dazed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/24335/1/vivienne-westwood-s-top-ten-political-moments|title=Vivienne Westwood's top ten political moments|last=Dazed|website=Dazed|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet." Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like "Feminist but feminine" and "Ladies first." According to Water,&lt;ref name="Dazed" /&gt; "The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour."

As we undergo a global economic downturn{{when|date=May 2018}}, the "Spend now, think later" belief is getting less relevant in our society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn/Berelowitz|first=Jessica/Marian|date=2015|title=The circular economy|url=http://0-www.warc.com.library.scad.edu/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=4f8c0345-e2ef-48a2-ae79-b614a535a19d&amp;q=economy+trend+fashion&amp;CID=A105052&amp;PUB=ATTICUS|journal=Warc|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society. They're looking for ways to mediate their material desires with an aim to do more good in the world. A linear economy is slowly shifting to a circular one.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company "represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning," according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay €7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's "Used Gear" section.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== China's domestic spending ====
Consumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes — easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.

=== Consumers' needs ===

Consumers all have different needs and demands that have to be suited. A person's needs change frequently.  An important factor to take into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs is the key demographics of the customer. Gender, age, income, and even profession can help a company better understand the needs of their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs &amp; Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a woman who is pregnant could be looking for diapers, baby strollers, and maternity clothes. Her needs would differ greatly from a woman with children that just went off to college or a teen entering high school.

Often consumers need to be told what they want. Fashion companies have to do their research to ensure they know their customers' needs before developing solutions. Steve Jobs said, "You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You cannot start with the technology and try to figure out where you are going to sell it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best way to understand the consumers' needs and therefore predict fashion trends is through [[market research]]. There are two research methods: primary and secondary.&lt;ref name="Consumer Research Methods"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups.

Benefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.&lt;ref name="Consumer Research Methods"/&gt; Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.

Knowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.

==Media==

Fashion breathes on media and medium .
The media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by [[Lucien Vogel]] and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the "fashionista on a budget". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as "blogger of the moment" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Fateh, Azhar. “How Social Media Is Changing Fashion?” The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. "Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January", she writes. "Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying."&lt;ref&gt;Tax, Genevieve.

The fashion industry has been the subject of numerous films and television shows, including the reality show ''[[Project Runway]]'' and the drama series ''[[Ugly Betty]]''. Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N. Designing for the famous – psychology of building a brand in haute couture shoe design and fashion. Design Principles &amp; Practices: An International Journal 2011;5(5):1–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Videos in general have been very useful in promoting the fashion industry. This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.

==Public relations and social media==
[[File:Ines Sainz.jpg|thumb|upright|A Mexican sports reporter wearing [[little black dress]] and knee-high boots]]

Fashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, G., &amp; Perlman, S. (2010). Fashion public relations. New York: Fairchild Books. In Cassidy, L. &amp; Fitch, K. (2013) Beyond the Catwalk: Fashion Public Relations and Social Media in Australia, Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal, vol. 14, No. 1 &amp; 2, Murdoch University.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media plays an important role in modern-day fashion public relations; enabling practitioners to reach a wide range of consumers through various platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/oliver-tan-visenze-guest-pot-fast-fashion/|title=How Social Media Contributed to the Rise of Fast Fashion|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building brand awareness and credibility is a key implication of good public relations. In some cases, great hype is built about new designers' collections before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure generated by practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Westfield, A. M. (2002) The Role of Public Relations in Redefining Brands in the Fashion Industry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media, such as blogs, micro blogs, podcasts, photo and video sharing sites have all become increasingly important to fashion public relations.&lt;ref&gt;Experian.

With blogging platforms such as Instagram, Tumblr, Wordpress, and other sharing sites, bloggers have emerged as expert fashion commentators, shaping brands and having a great impact on what is ‘on trend’.&lt;ref&gt;Dalto, A.

==Anthropological perspective==
Anthropology, the study of culture and human societies, studies fashion by asking why certain styles are deemed socially appropriate and others are not. A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39–55 [42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
In the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that "Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.

Since fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.

In 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&amp;deptid=8 IPFrontline.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510220626/http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&amp;deptid=8 |date=2007-05-10 }}: Intellectual Property in Fashion Industry, WIPO press release, December 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insme.org/page.asp?IDArea=1&amp;page=sanleucio INSME announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090258/http://www.insme.org/page.asp?IDArea=1&amp;page=sanleucio |date=2007-09-29 }}: WIPO-Italy International Symposium, 30 November – 2 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==

The '''Four Symbols''' ({{zh|c=四象|p=Sì Xiàng}}, literally meaning "four images") are four [[Chinese mythology|mythological]] creatures in the [[Chinese constellations]]. They are the [[Azure Dragon]] of the East, the [[Vermilion Bird]] of the South, the [[White Tiger (China)|White Tiger]] of the West, and the [[Black Tortoise|Black Turtle]] of the North. Each one of them represents a direction and a season, and each has its own individual characteristics and origins. Symbolically and as part of spiritual and religious belief, they have been culturally important across countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]].

==History==
The Four Symbols were given human names{{clarify|reason="Human name" as opposed to what?|date=March 2018}} after [[Daoism]] became popular. The [[Azure Dragon]] has the name Meng Zhang ({{lang|zh|孟章}}), the [[Vermilion Bird]] was called Ling Guang ({{lang|zh|陵光}}), the [[White Tiger (China)|White Tiger]] Jian Bing ({{lang|zh|監兵}}), and the [[Black Tortoise|Black Turtle]] Zhi Ming ({{lang|zh|執明}}).

In 1987, a tomb was found at [[Xishuipo]] (西水坡) in [[Puyang]], [[Henan]]. There were some clam shells and bones forming the images of the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, and the [[Big Dipper (asterism)|Big Dipper]]. It is believed that the tomb belongs to the Neolithic Age, dating to about 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:濮阳西水坡蚌壳龙虎图案研究述评|url=http://www.ha.xinhuanet.com/xhzt/2007-05/25/content_10127699.htm|publisher=XinHuaNet|accessdate=11 May 2011|author=孙德萱|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927111809/http://www.ha.xinhuanet.com/xhzt/2007-05/25/content_10127699.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Rongcheng Shi]]'' manuscript recovered in 1994 gives five directions rather than four and places the animals quite differently: [[Yu the Great]] gave banners to his people marking the north with a [[bird]], the south with a [[snake]], the east with the sun, the west with the moon, and the center with a [[bear]].&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri. "[http://www.eacenter.huji.ac.il/uploaded/fck/Rong%20Cheng%20shi%20BSOAS.pdf Political Mythology and Dynastic Legitimacy in the ''Rong Cheng Shi'' Manuscript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425122636/http://www.eacenter.huji.ac.il/uploaded/fck/Rong%20Cheng%20shi%20BSOAS.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}". ''Bulletin of SOAS'', Vol. 73, No. 3 (2010), p. 515. Accessed 22 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colours of the animals also match the colours of soil in the corresponding areas of China: the bluish-grey water-logged soils of the east, the reddish iron-rich soils of the south, the whitish saline soils of the western deserts, the black organic-rich soils of the north and the yellow soils from the central loess plateau.&lt;ref&gt;N, Brady and R, Weil. [Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soil]. (2014). p. 89. Accessed 27 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correspondence with the Five Principles==
[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 042.jpg|thumb|A Han-dynasty pottery tile emblematically representing the five cardinal directions]]
These mythological creatures have also been synthesized into the [[Wu Xing|five principles system]]. The Azure Dragon of the East represents Wood, the Vermilion Bird of the South represents Fire, the White Tiger of the West represents Metal, and the Black Turtle (or Dark Warrior) of the North represents Water. In this system, the fifth principle Earth is represented by the [[Yellow Dragon|Yellow Dragon of the Center]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Brief History of Chinese and Japanese Civilizations: Third Edition.", Schirokauer, Brown, Lurie, Gay. (2006) {{ISBN|0-534-64307-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Correspondence with the Four Seasons ==

The four beasts each represent a season. The Azure Dragon of the East represents Spring, the Vermilion Bird of the South represents Summer, the White Tiger of the West represents Autumn, and the Black Turtle of the North represents Winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://primaltrek.com/impliedmeaning.html |title= The Hidden or Implied Meaning of Chinese Charm Symbols - 諧音寓意 - Differences between Chinese Coins and Chinese Charms.|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=22 May 2018|work= Gary Ashkenazy / גארי אשכנזי (Primaltrek – a journey through Chinese culture)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French maid''' is a strongly modified style of [[domestic worker|servant's]] dress that evolved from typical [[maid|housemaid's]] black-and-white afternoon uniforms of [[France in the long nineteenth century|19th-century France]] (and their later use by stereotypical [[soubrette]] characters in [[burlesque]] dramas and [[bedroom farce]]s). Some styles are conservative while others are revealing. The French maid costume is often used in [[cosplay]], [[sexual roleplay]]ing, and [[Uniform fetishism#French maid uniform|uniform fetishism]]. Depending on design details, some forms can be classified as [[lingerie]].

==Costume details==
Though not strict to historically accurate uniforms, the French maid outfit has an easily recognizable pattern and black-and white theme that remains the template for other forms of the costume.

The typical French maid costume includes:
* A black dress with white trim, with a full skirt at or above knee length.
* White half-apron, usually with ruffle or lace
* A ruffled or lace headpiece
* Long stockings or tights. These can be white or black and vary from design to design.
* High heels 
* [[Feather duster]]
* White or black lace [[garter (stockings)|garter]]

Optional accessories depend on design and context:
* [[Choker]] necklace
* Pearls
* Other cleaning equipment

==Culture==
The outfits are frequently worn to [[costume parties]] (fancy dress), and also used in drama/theater.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="913">The '''human dartboard''' is a contemporary [[sideshow]] act in which one person throws [[Dart (missile)|darts]] at another person.  Usually the thrower is the target's assistant or a member of the [[audience]].  This act was popularized by the [[Jim Rose Circus]], where it was performed by Jim, in the role of the target, and his wife Bebe, who threw the darts.  Usually darts are thrown into the back of the target, and the [[vertebral column|spine]] is protected by a board or other long object stuck into the waistband.

==Hybridity as racial mixing==
{{Main|Multiracial}}
Hybridity is a cross between two separate races, plants or cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Lusty, Natalya. ''Surrealism, Feminism, Psychoanalysis'' 2007, Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5336-3}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; A hybrid is something that is mixed, and hybridity is simply mixture. Hybridity is not a new cultural or historical phenomenon. It has been a feature of all civilizations since time immemorial, from the Sumerians through the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans to the present. Both ancient and modern civilizations have, through trade and conquests, borrowed foreign ideas, philosophies, and sciences, thus producing hybrid cultures and societies. The term hybridity itself is not a modern coinage. It was common among the Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization|last=Acheraiou|first=Amar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0-230-29828-6|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michelini|first=Ann|year=1978|title=HYBRIS and plants|url=|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=82|pages=35–44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin hybrida or ibrida refers to "the offspring of a tame sow and a wild boar,"&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionnary&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension to the progeny of a Roman man and a non-Roman woman. The word hybridity was in use in English since the early 17th century and gained popular currency in the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]] used this term in 1837 in reference to his experiments in cross-fertilization in plants. The concept of hybridity was fraught with negative connotations from its incipience. The Greeks and Romans borrowed extensively from other civilizations, the Egyptians and Persians in particular, and creating ''ipso facto'' hybridized cultures, but regarded unfavourably biological hybridity. [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Pericles]] were all opposed to racial mixing between Greeks and "barbarians" and viewed biological hybridity as a source of racial degeneration and social disorder. Similarly, within the Roman Empire, which is considered as one of the most multi-ethnic empires, cultural difference was usually integrated into the predominant culture, whereas biological hybridity was condemned.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity|last=Isaac|first=Benjamin|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans’ attitudes to racial mixing hardened from the 4th century AD when Rome embraced the Christian faith. This is manifest in the [[Codex Theodosianus]] (AD365) which prohibited marriages between Christians and non-Christians, the Jews in particular, and inflicted death penalty on those who did not obey this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Holy Matrimony: A Treatise on the Divine Laws of Marriage|last=Watkins|first=Oscar Daniel|publisher=Percival|year=1895|isbn=|location=Rivington|pages=496|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contempt for biological hybridity did not end with the fall the Roman Empire, but continued throughout the Middle Ages and well into modern times, reaching a peak in the nineteenth century with the rise of Europe into an unrivalled imperial power. Hybridity and fear of racial degeneration caused by the mixing of Europeans and non-Europeans were major concerns in 19th century colonialist discourse prompted by racist pseudo-scientific discourses found in such works as [[Arthur de Gobineau|Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''Essai sur l’inégalité des races'' and [[Ernest Renan|Joseph-Ernest Renan]]'s ''L’Education culturelle et morale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization|last=Acheraiou|first=Amar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0-230-29828-6|location=London|pages=13–83|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an explicative term, hybridity became a useful tool in forming a fearful discourse of racial mixing that arose toward the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalheiro, José. ''Is the Discourse of Hybridity a Celebration of Mixing, or a Reformulation of Racial Division? A Multimodal Analysis of the Portuguese Magazine Afro.'' Forum: Qualitative Social Research [Online], 11.2 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-scientific models of anatomy and [[craniometry]] were used to argue that Africans, Asians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders were racially inferior to Europeans. The fear of [[miscegenation]] that followed responds to the concern that the offspring of racial interbreeding would result in the dilution of the European race. Hybrids were seen as an aberration, worse than the inferior races, a weak and diseased mutation. Hybridity as a concern for racial purity responds clearly to the zeitgeist of colonialism where, despite the backdrop of the humanitarian [[age of enlightenment]], social hierarchy was beyond contention as was the position of Europeans at its summit. The social transformations that followed the ending of colonial mandates, rising immigration, and economic liberalization profoundly altered the use and understanding of the term hybridity.&lt;ref name="RJCY" /&gt;

==Hybridity in post-colonial discourse==
''Hybrid talk'', the rhetoric of hybridity, is fundamentally associated with the emergence of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] discourse and its critiques of [[cultural imperialism]]. It is the second stage in the history of hybridity, characterized by literature and theory that study the effects of mixture (hybridity) upon identity and culture. The principal theorists of hybridity are [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]], [[Néstor García Canclini]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], and [[Paul Gilroy]], whose works respond to the multi-cultural awareness that emerged in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Stuart. ‘New Ethnicities’ in ''‘Race’, Culture and Difference'', James Donald, James, and Ali Rattansi, eds. (London: Sage 1992) pp. 252-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theoretic development of hybridity, the key text is ''The Location of Culture'' (1994), by Homi Bhabha, wherein the [[liminality]] of hybridity is presented as a paradigm of colonial anxiety.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;Bhabha, Homi K. ''The Location of Culture''. 1994. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal proposition is the hybridity of colonial identity, which, as a cultural form, made the colonial masters ambivalent, and, as such, altered the [[authority]] of [[Power (philosophy)|power]]; as such, Bhabha's arguments are important to the conceptual discussion of ''hybridity''. Hybridity demonstrates how cultures come to be represented by processes of iteration and translation through which their meanings are vicariously addressed to—through—an Other. This contrasts any "essentialist claims for the inherent authenticity or purity of cultures which, when inscribed in the naturalistic sign of symbolic consciousness frequently become political arguments for the hierarchy and ascendary of powerful cultures." &lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; This also means that the colonial subject takes place, its subaltern position inscribed in that space of iteration. The colonial subject is located in a place of hybridity, its identity formed in a space of iteration and translation by the colonizer. Bhabha emphasizes that "the discriminatory effects of the discourse of cultural colonialism, for instance, do not simply or singly refer to a ‘person’… or to a discrimination between mother culture and alien culture…the reference of discrimination is always to a process of splitting as the condition of subjection: a discrimination between the mother and its bastards, the self and its doubles, where the trace of what is disavowed is not repressed but repeated as something different—a mutation." &lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; Like mimicry, hybridity is a metonymy of presence. Hybridity opens up a space, figuratively speaking, where the construction of a political object that is new, neither the colonizer nor the Other, properly defies our political expectations.  However, like Bhabha's concept of mimicry, hybridity is a doubling, dissembling image of being in at least two places at once. This turn in the effect of hybridity makes the presence of colonist authority no longer immediately visible.

Bhabha includes interpretations of hybridity in postcolonial discourse. One is that he sees hybridity as a strategic reversal of the process domination through disavowal. Hybridity reevaluates the assumption of colonial identity through the repetition of discriminatory identity effects. In this way, hybridity can unsettle the narcissist demands of colonial power, but reforms its identifications in strategies of subversion that turn the gaze of the discriminated back upon the colonist. Therefore, with this interpretation, hybridity represents that ambivalent ‘turn’ of the subject into the anxiety-causing object of "paranoid classification—a disturbing questioning of the images and presences of authority". The hybrid retains the actual semblance of the authoritative symbol but reforms its presence by denying it as the signifier of disfigurement—after the intervention of difference. In turn, mimicry is the effect of hybridity. First, the metonymy of presence supports the authoritarian voyeurism, but then as discrimination turns into the assertion of the hybrid, the sign of authority becomes a mask, a mockery.&lt;ref name="HB" /&gt;

Although the original, theoretic development of hybridity addressed the narratives of cultural imperialism, Bhabha's work also comprehends the cultural politics of the condition of being "a migrant" in the contemporary metropolis. Yet hybridity no longer is solely associated with migrant populations and with border towns, it also applies contextually to the flow of cultures and their interactions.

That critique of cultural imperialist hybridity meant that the rhetoric of hybridity progressed to challenging [[essentialism]], and is applied to sociological theories of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[multiculturalism]], and [[racism]]. Moreover, ''polyphony'' is another important element of hybridity theory, by [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], which is applied to hybrid discourses presented in [[folklore]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kapchan, Deborah and [[Pauline Turner Strong|Turner Strong, Pauline]], eds. ''Theorizing the Hybrid.'' Special issue, Journal of American Folklore, vol. 112, no. 445 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of hybridity theory===
The development of hybridity theory as a discourse of anti-essentialism marked the height of the popularity of academic "hybridity talk". However the usage of hybridity in theory to eliminate essentialist thinking and practices (namely racism) failed as hybridity itself is prone to the same essentialist framework and thus requires definition and placement. A number of arguments have followed in which promoters and detractors argue the uses of hybridity theory. Much of this debate can be criticized as being excessively bogged down in theory and pertaining to some unhelpful quarrels on the direction hybridity should progress e.g. attached to racial theory, post-colonialism, cultural studies, or globalization. Sociologist [[Jan Nederveen Pieterse]] highlights these core arguments in a debate that promotes hybridity.&lt;ref name="Pieterse"&gt;Nederveen Pieterse, Jan, ''Globalization and Culture: global mélange''. 2004, Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt;

Some on the left, such as cultural theorist John Hutnyk, have criticized hybridity as politically void.&lt;ref name="Hutnyk" /&gt; Others like Aijaz Ahmad, Arif Dirlik, and Benita Parry blame Homi Bhabha for recycling obscure psychoanalytic and postmodern theories of culture and identity. Ahmad criticizes Bhabha for establishing a postcolonial theory which overlooks the material colonial context and post-independence realities of the former colonies. He writes: "Between postcoloniality as it exists in a former colony like India, and postcoloniality as the condition of discourse by such critics as Bhabha, there would appear to be a considerable gap".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=Aijaz|year=1995|title=The Politics of Literary Postcoloniality|url=|journal=Race and Class|volume=36-3|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dirlik follows in a similar vein, stressing the postcolonial theorists’ propensity to flatten out cultural difference under the umbrella term of hybridity: "Africa, Caribbean, South-Asian literatures come from different places and different histories, and not merely different from France, but different from each other. It is this real sort of difference that disappears in postcolonial studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postconial Aura: Third World Criticism in the Age of Global Capitalism|last=Dirlik|first=Arif|publisher=Westview Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Boulder|pages=ix|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Signs of our Time" Benita Parry discusses ''The Location of Culture'' and criticizes the "linguistic turn" in cultural studies,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Third Text Reader: On Art, Culture and Theory|last=Araeen|first=Rasheed|publisher=Continuum|year=2002|isbn=|location=London|pages=243; 230|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more particularly, Bhabha's dependence on fuzzy psychoanalytical and linguistic explanations of cultural identities, or what she calls the "autarchy of the signifier".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''In Postcolonial Studies: a materialist critique,'' she further rails against the "linguistic turn" and recommends a materialist postcolonial critique that addresses colonialism's epistemic violence within the wider context of the economic exploitation of the colonized masses by imperial capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Studies: A Materialist Critique|last=Parry|first=Benita|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Amar Acheraiou in ''Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization'' challenges Bhabha's theory of hybridity on theoretical as well as ideological and historical grounds. He criticizes Bhabha for examining hybridity from a narrow, "synchronic" perspective confined to the 19th century, instead of adopting a "diachronic" view which renders better this concept's historical depth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also reproaches this theorist for stripping the notion of hybridity off its constitutive racial connotations and considers this as an essentialist gesture. According to him, by clearing this concept of its negative biological associations, Bhabha evades the discussion of the problematic issue of race and racism, which should, paradoxically, be a central concern in hybridity theory. He further argues that Bhabha overlooks the fact that there are still today several places across the world where for many biologically hybrids, hybridity or "the third space" often proves "the space of the impossible"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; rather than a site of cultural and racial emancipation. The new theory of hybridity that Acheraiou develops in this book departs from the strictly "cultural and spatial paradigm" of postcolonial theory, or what he calls "angelic hybridism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is a broadly historical and multi-layered form of hybridity focused on the nebulous political, economic, and ideological power structures, emancipatory as well as oppressive, which have presided over the discourse and practice of hybridity since the dawn of civilization. He calls this alternative mode of rethinking postcoloniality "a radical ethics of hybridity," which is "global in scope and planetary in aspiration". Furthermore, he stresses that this "resistive planetary hybridity" is not "confined to the migrant, diasporic condition," and has "as many centres of consciousness as geographical points of origin".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The next phase in the use of the term has been to see hybridity as a cultural effect of globalization. For example, hybridity is presented by Kraidy as the ‘cultural logic’ of globalization as it "entails that traces of other cultures exist in every culture, thus offering foreign media and marketers transcultural wedges for forging affective links between their commodities and local communities."&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, Marwan ''Hybridity: or the cultural logic of globalization'' 2005, Philadelphia: Temple, {{ISBN|81-317-1100-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another promoter of hybridity as globalization is [[Jan Nederveen Pieterse]], who asserts hybridity as the [[rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] of culture.&lt;ref name="Pieterse" /&gt; He argues that globalization as hybridization opposes views which see the process as homogenizing, modernizing, and westernizing, and that it broadens the empirical history of the concept. However neither of these scholars have reinvigorated the hybridity theory debate in terms of solving its inherent problematics. The term hybridity remains contested precisely because it has resisted the appropriations of numerous discourses despite the fact that it is radically malleable. For example, young Muslims in Indonesia are followers of Islam but have "synthesized" trends from global culture in ways that respect religious tradition.  These include drinking [[Islamic dietary laws|non-alcoholic beer]], using [[Quran|Koranic]] apps on their iPhones, and buying ''[[halal]]'' cosmetics. In anti-Western countries, youth who try to create cultural hybridity through clothing conflict with the traditional views of modesty in their religion. Conflict occurs across generations when older adults clash with youth over youth attempts to change traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Néstor García Canclini|García Canclini, Néstor]].  ''Hybrid Cultures''.  Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Furlong|first1 = Andy|title = Youth Studies: An introduction|publisher = Routledge|location = USA|isbn = 978-0-415-56479-3|pages = 237–238|edition = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybridity in linguistics==

=== Linguistic hybridity and colonialism ===
Languages are all hybrid, in varying degrees. For centuries people borrowed from foreign languages, creating thus hybrid linguistic idioms. They did so for commercial, aesthetic, ideological and technological reasons (to facilitate trade transactions, express philosophical or scientific ideas unavailable in their original idioms, enrich and adapt their languages to new realities, subvert a dominant colonial literary canon by deliberately introducing words from the colonized peoples' idiom). Trade and colonization have been the main vehicles of linguistic hybridization across history. Since the classical conquests, both the colonizers and colonized tapped into each other's languages. The Greeks soaked up many mathematical and astronomical concepts from the Egyptians. The Romans, too, absorbed much of Greek culture and ideas. They also drew abundantly from the "barbarians". In ''Taktika'', [[Arrian]] (92–175 AD), a Greek historian and philosopher of the Roman period, drew attention to the Romans' indebtedness to their colonial subjects, arguing that "the Romans have many foreign (Iberian, Celtic) terms for formations, for they used Celtic cavalry".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In modern times, the French and British resorted to similar linguistic appropriations throughout their conquests. The French language, for example, contains over 200 Arabic and Berber words, most of which were taken up during France's colonization of Algeria. Similarly, hundreds of Indian words entered the English idiom from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. According to ''The Oxford English Dictionary,'' 900 English words are of Indian origin. Linguistic hybridity was manifest in these colonial contexts, but was acknowledged by neither the colonizers nor the colonized. More still, while these linguistic borrowings had, de facto, rendered colonial languages hybrid and therefore impure, the myth of linguistic purity and superiority, inherited from the ancient Greeks’ "linguistic racialism",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; held firmly among the European colonizers. The Greek word ‘barbarian,’ which was used to refer to non-Greek languages’ inferiority, backwardness and inarticulacy, was adopted by the French since the 16th century. It was often applied to the Basque, Breton and Occitan languages and to their speakers. [[Henri Grégoire|Abbé Grégoire]] recommended wiping out these "crude idioms" and forcing French on the Basques, Bretons and Occitans to "spread enlightened ideas (...), well-being and political tranquillity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Une politique de la langue: La révolution française et le patois, l'enquête et le patois|last=De Certeau|first=Michel|publisher=Gallimard|year=1975|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, this would "banish superstition" and "simplify the mechanism of the political machine." It would, above all, "mould the citizens into a national whole"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dominant Languages: Language and Hierarchy in Britain and France|last=Grillo|first=R. D.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=24; 174.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, this Aristotelian view of language was revitalized by authors like [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson]], and [[Matthew Arnold]], who cast respectively the Irish, Scots and Welsh as "rude" and "backward", attributing these peoples’ intellectual and economic "backwardness" to their "inferior" languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Postcolonialism: Colonialist Discourse in Modern Literatures and the Legacy of Classical Writers|last=Acheraiou|first=Amar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=0-230-55205-6|location=Basingstoke|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linguistic Hybridity: a dual dynamics ===
Linguistic and cultural hybridity is a "dual dynamics" which operates "passively" as well as "actively".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] distinguished two types of hybridity: "organic" or "unconscious" hybridity and "intentional" hybridity. He defines organic hybridity as an "unintentional, unconscious hybridization" and regards it as "the most important mode in the historical life and evolution of all languages".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakhtin|first=Michael|year=2004|title=Discourse in the Novel (1935)|url=|journal=in Michael Holquist (ed.), The Dialogic Imagination|volume=|pages=259–422|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Intentional hybridization" consists of juxtaposing deliberately different idioms, discourses, and perspectives within the same semiotic space without merging them. Bakhtin states that the language of the novel is "a system of languages that mutually and ideologically interanimate each other".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakhtin|first=Michael|year=2004|title=From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse (1940)|url=|journal=In Michael Holquist (ed.), The Dialogic Imagination|volume=|pages=41–83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "the novelistic hybrid is an artistically organized system for bringing different languages in contact with one another, a system having as its goal the illumination of one language by another, the carving-out of a living image of another language".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Further down, yet, he cautions against drawing clear-cut boundaries between these two forms of hybridity, arguing that the "centripetal" forces inherent in "organic hybridity" are also present in "intentional hybridity," in the same way as the "centrifugal" features of "intentional hybridity" may be at play in "organic hybridity."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Hybridity and the Tree Model ===
Linguistic hybridity and the case of mixed languages challenge the [[Comparative method|Tree Model]] in [[linguistics]]. For example, "Israeli" (a term for [[Modern Hebrew]]) has been argued to be a Semito-European hybrid language that "demonstrates that the reality of linguistic genesis is far more complex than a simple family tree system allows. 'Revived' languages are unlikely to have a single parent."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil'ad. '[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns]' in ''Journal of Language Contact'', 2009, Varia 2, pp. 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybridity in art==
Presently, human beings are immersed in a hybridised environment of reality and augmented reality on a daily basis, considering the proliferation of physical and digital media (i.e. print books vs. e-books, music downloads vs. physical formats). Many people attend performances intending to place a digital recording device between them and the performers, intentionally "layering a digital reality on top of the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsukayama |first=Hayley |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/faster-forward/post/apple-patent-would-stop-iphone-concert-recordings/2011/06/20/AGV7AFdH_blog.html |title=Apple patent would stop iPhone concert recordings |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For artists working with and responding to new technologies, the hybridisation of physical and digital elements has become a reflexive reaction to this strange dichotomy.&lt;ref name="DazedConfused"&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight |first=Amy |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/blog/article/15085/1/hybridity-in-new-art |title=Hybridity in new art |publisher=[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Rooms'' by Sara Ludy computer-generated effects process physical spaces into abstractions, making familiar environments and items such as carpets, doors and windows disorientating, set to the sound of an industrial hum. In effect, the distinction between real and virtual space in [[art]] is deconstructed.&lt;ref name="DazedConfused" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triangulationblog.com/2012/02/rooms-by-sara-ludy.html ''Rooms'' by Sara Ludy TRIANGULATION BLOG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/film_history/summary/v019/19.2donato.html Docufictions: an interview with Martin Scorsese on documentary film] by [https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/189594/Raffaele-Donato Raffaele Donato] at Film History: An International Journal Volume 19, Number 2, 2007

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1541">'''Jack o' Lent''' was a tradition in [[England]] in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries involving the abuse and burning of a straw effigy during the season of [[Lent]], ending with its burning on [[Palm Sunday]]. 

The effigy, made of straw or stuffed clothes,&lt;ref name=brand/&gt; was abused and stoned on [[Ash Wednesday]] while being dragged about the [[parish]]. The figure was kept until Palm Sunday, when it was burnt. Its burning was often believed to be a symbolic revenge on [[Judas Iscariot]], who had betrayed [[Christ]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">In philosophical discourse, '''lexis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: λέξις "word") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.

== Lexis according to Plato ==

According to [[Plato]], lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into [[mimesis]] (imitation properly speaking) and [[diegesis]] (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: "Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad".&lt;ref&gt;"Boundaries of a Narrative," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1–13. JSTOR. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to [[Gerald Prince]], diegesis in the ''Iliad'' is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the'' Iliad'' is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince. ''A Dictionary of Narratolog''y. 2003. University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the "direct representation of the actors speaking to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Gennette 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis according to Aristotle ==

According to Jose M. Gonzalez, "Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis."&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Gonzalez, "Phantasia and Aristotle." JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.
 
Gonzalez also points out that, "By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis." [[Phantasia (philosophy)|Phantasia]] is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as "our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image." &lt;ref&gt;Jana Noel. "Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis". 1997.[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/eps/PES-Yearbook/97_docs/noel.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.

== Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle ==

Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an "elevated subject of inquiry," he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech.  Often calling it "style," he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness.  Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.".&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle''. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed.  [[Donald McQuade|Donald, McQuade]]. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the "proper method of delivery." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. 
 
'''Voice''' 

At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice.  They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Rhetoric]]'', Aristotles says, "proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions.  The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice.  This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, "voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Stoehr. "Tone and Voice."  ''College English'' Nov. 1968:  JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO.  28 April 2008. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/374450]. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice.  Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Stoehr 150&lt;/ref&gt;       

'''Language'''

As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude.  The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life.  However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.

The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking.  In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life.  They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech.  Most of all, the speaker must "give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. 

Also, a speaker must avoid using very many "strange words, compound words, and invented words.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak.  However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of [[metaphor]] because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.

== Two forms of lexis ==

According to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style.  However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms.  The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: ''lexis graphike'' and ''lexis agonistike'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Sonkowsky, ”An Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.” p. 259 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/283710?seq=4&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=agonistike&amp;term=graphike&amp;term=lexis&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlexis%2Bgraphike%2Band%2Blexis%2Bagonistike%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;cookieSet=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms.  Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.

''Lexis graphike'' comes from the term ''zographia'', meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same.   His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ''lexis graphik''e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lexis agonistike'' however is from the term ''skiagraphia'', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting.  Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ''lexis agonistike'' does not need questions asked, but only answers.  The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

To further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered.  ''Lexis graphike'' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence.  The delivery of ''lexis graphike'' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation.  ''Lexis graphike'' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech.  ''Lexis agonistike'' contradicts ''lexis graphike'' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance.  The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of urban legends==
* '''[[999 phone charging myth]]''' is an urban legend which claims that calling the emergency services then hanging up charges mobile phone batteries.
* A '''[[Black dog (ghost)|black dog]]''' is the name given to a being found primarily in the folklores of Britain and Ireland. The black dog is essentially a nocturnal apparition, often said to be associated with the devil or a [[hellhound]]. Its appearance was regarded as a portent of death. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog, and often has large, glowing eyes. It is often associated with electrical storms (such as Black Shuck's appearance at Bungay, Suffolk), and also with crossroads, places of execution and ancient pathways.
* '''[[Baby Train]]''' is an urban legend which claims that a small town had an unusually high birth rate because a train would pass through the town at 5:00 am and blow its whistle, waking up all the residents. Since it was too late to go back to sleep and too early to get up, couples would find other ways to amuse themselves in bed. This resulted in the mini-baby boom.&lt;ref name="Nicolaisen, W.F.H."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicolaisen|first1=W.F.H.|title=The Baby Train and Other Lusty Urban Legends by Jan Harold Brunvand|journal=Folklore|date=1997|volume=108|pages=134–135|jstor=1260739|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. on behalf of Folklore Enterprises, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes, baby train"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Baby Train|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-baby-train/|website=Snopes|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Black-eyed children]]''' (or '''black-eyed kids''') are an urban legend of supposed paranormal creatures that resemble children between the ages of 6 and 16, with pale skin and black eyes, who are reportedly seen hitchhiking or panhandling, or are encountered on doorsteps of residential homes. Tales of black-eyed children have appeared in pop culture since the late 1990s.
* '''[[Black Shuck]]''', '''Old Shuck''', '''Old Shock''', or simply '''Shuck''' is the name given to a ghostly [[Black dog (ghost)|black dog]] which is said to roam the coastline and countryside of [[East Anglia]]. Accounts of the animal form part of the folklore of [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]], the [[Cambridgeshire]] [[fens]] and [[Essex]].
* The '''[[Blue star tattoo legend]]''' refers to a modern legend that [[LSD]] tabs are being distributed as lick-and-stick temporary tattoos to children.
* '''[[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]]''' is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost or spirit conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is called multiple times. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. The Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation games.
* '''[[Bunny Man]]''' is an urban legend that probably originated from two incidents in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], in 1970, but has been spread throughout the Washington D.C. area. There are many variations to the legend, but most involve a man wearing a rabbit costume ("bunny suit") who attacks people with an axe.
* The '''[[chupacabra]]''' (Spanish pronunciation: [tʃupaˈkaβɾa], from chupar "to suck" and cabra "goat", literally "goat sucker") is a legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas, with the first sightings reported in Puerto Rico. The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats.
* '''[[Cow tipping]]''' purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment.
* '''[[Creepypasta]]s''' are [[Horror and terror|horror]]-related [[legend]]s or images that have been copy-and-pasted around the [[Internet]]. These Internet entries are often brief, user-generated, paranormal stories intended to scare readers. They include gruesome tales of murder, suicide, and otherworldly occurrences. People often falsely believe them to be true.
* The '''[[Curse of the Bambino]]''' was a superstition evolving from the failure of the Boston Red Sox baseball team to win the World Series in the 86-year period from 1918 to 2004. While some fans took the curse seriously, most used the expression in a tongue-in-cheek manner.
* '''[[Hippo eats dwarf|Hippo Eats Dwarf]]'''. An internet-spread urban legend about a circus performer being accidentally swallowed by a hippopotamus.&lt;ref name="Boese2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boese|first=Alex|title=Hippo Eats Dwarf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJQzXOJtRfcC|date=5 February 2010|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-330-52130-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[The Hook]]''', also called '''Hookman''', is a classic example of an urban legend.  Originating in post-war America, it recounts a story of a murderer with a hook [[prosthesis]] in place of a hand.
* '''[[JATO Rocket Car]]''' started as a [[Darwin Awards|Darwin Award]] winner where a driver strapped a pair of Jet Assisted Take Off [[JATO]] units to the rear of his car and ended up smashing into the side of a hill in Arizona.  No police agency in Arizona took a report of this type of accident.  The [[Arizona Department of Public Safety]] even issued a press release on their website debunking the report.  
* '''[[Killer in the backseat]]''' (also known as '''High Beams''') is a common car-crime urban legend well known mostly in the United States and United Kingdom. The legend involves a woman who is driving and being followed by a strange car or truck. The mysterious pursuer flashes his [[headlamp|high beams]], [[tailgating|tailgates]] her and sometimes even rams her vehicle. When she finally makes it home, she realizes that the driver was trying to warn her that there was a man (a [[murderer]], [[rapist]], or escaped [[mental patient]]) hiding in her back seat. Each time the man sat up to attack her, the driver behind had used his high beams to scare the killer, in which he ducks down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bronner |first= Simon J. |title= American Children's Folklore |authorlink= Simon J.

In the [[cinema of the United States]], the '''Magical Negro''' is a [[Supporting character|supporting]] [[stock character]] who comes to the aid of [[White people|white]] [[protagonist]]s in a [[film]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |title= That Old Black Magic |date= May 27, 2000 |last= Farley |first= Christopher John |authorlink= Christopher John Farley |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |quote= In ''The Legend of Bagger Vance'', one of the more embarrassing movies in recent history, [[Will Smith]] plays a magical black caddie who helps [[Matt Damon]] win a golf tournament and the heart of [[Charlize Theron]].… The first is the Magical African-American Friend [MAAF].

The term ''Magical Negro'' was popularized in 2001 by [[film director]] [[Spike Lee]], while discussing films with students during a tour of college campuses, in which he said he was dismayed at [[Hollywood]]'s decision to continue employing this premise; he noted that the films ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' used the "super-duper magical Negro".&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;&lt;ref name="SpikeLee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SpikeLee"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n21/story3.html |title= Director Spike Lee slams 'same old' black stereotypes in today's films |first= Susan |last= Gonzalez |work= Yale Bulletin &amp; Calendar |publisher= Yale University |date= March 2, 2001 |archivedate= 2009-01-21 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090121190429/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n21/story3.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Kempley"&gt;{{cite web |title= Too Too Divine: Movies' 'Magic Negro' Saves the Day – but at the Cost of His Soul |url= http://www.blackcommentator.com/49/49_magic.html |last= Kempley |first= Rita |date= June 7, 2003 |accessdate= March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strangehorizons"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20041025/kinga.shtml |title= Stephen King's Super-Duper Magical Negroes |first=Nnedi |last= Okorafor |authorlink= Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu |work= Strange Horizons |date= October 25, 2004 |accessdate= December 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061114013842/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20041025/kinga.shtml |archivedate= November 14, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics use the word "[[Negro]]" because it is considered archaic, and usually offensive, in modern English. This underlines their message that a "magical black character" who goes around selflessly helping white people is a throwback to stereotypes such as the "[[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]]" or "[[noble savage]]".&lt;ref name="race"/&gt;

The Magical Negro is a [[Trope (cinema)|trope]] created by white people: the character is typically, but not always, "in some way outwardly or inwardly disabled, either by discrimination, disability or social constraint". The Negro is often a janitor or prisoner.&lt;ref name="Hicks"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Heather |last=Hicks |journal= Camera Obscura |title= Hoodoo Economics: White Men's Work and Black Men's Magic in Contemporary American Film |volume= 18 |issue=2 |date=Sep 1, 2003 |pages= 27–55 |url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24435280_ITM |accessdate= February 3, 2007 |doi= 10.1215/02705346-18-2_53-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character often has no past but simply appears one day to help the [[white people|white]] protagonist.&lt;ref name="ejumpcut"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc45.2002/colombe/ |title= White Hollywood's new Black boogeyman |first=Audrey |last=Colombe |issue=45 |work= Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media |date= October 2002 |accessdate= December 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Contemporary Patterns of Politics, Praxis, and Culture |first=Georgia Anne |last=Persons |pages=137 |location=[[New Brunswick, NJ]] |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=1-4128-0468-X |oclc= 56510401}}&lt;/ref&gt; He or she usually has some sort of magical power, "rather vaguely defined but not the sort of thing one typically encounters."&lt;ref name="ejumpcut" /&gt; The character is patient and wise, often dispensing various words of wisdom, and is "closer to the earth".&lt;ref name="strangehorizons" /&gt; The character will also do almost anything, including sacrificing him or herself, to save the white protagonist, as exemplified in ''[[The Defiant Ones (film)|The Defiant Ones]]'', in which [[Sidney Poitier]] plays the prototypical Magical Negro.&lt;ref name="strangehorizons" /&gt;

[[Christopher John Farley]], referring to the magical Negro as "Magical African American Friends" (MAAFs), says they are rooted in screenwriter's ignorance of African Americans:
&lt;blockquote&gt;MAAFs exist because most Hollywood screenwriters don't know much about black people other than what they hear on records by white hip-hop star [[Eminem]]. So instead of getting life histories or love interests, black characters get magical powers.&lt;ref name="Hicks"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Magical Negro stereotype serves as a [[plot device]] to help the white protagonist get out of trouble, typically through helping the white character recognize his own faults and overcome them&lt;ref name="strangehorizons" /&gt; and teaching them to be a better person.&lt;ref&gt;Zuleyka Zevallosm. "[https://othersociologist.com/2012/01/24/hollywood-racism/ Hollywood Racism: The Magical Negro Trope]". ''Other Sociologist'', January 24, 2012. Accessed July 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the character may have magical powers, the "magic is ostensibly directed toward helping and enlightening a white male character".&lt;ref name="Hicks" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gabbard&gt;{{cite book |title= Black Magic: White Hollywood and African American Culture |first=Krin |last=Gabbard |pages=173 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=0-8135-3383-X |oclc= 53215708}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in a 2009 edition of the journal ''[[Social Problems]]'' stated the Magical Negro was an expression of [[racial profiling]] within the United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These powers are used to save and transform disheveled, uncultured, lost, or broken whites (almost exclusively white men) into competent, successful, and content people within the context of the American myth of redemption and salvation. It is this feature of the Magical Negro that some people find most troubling. Although from a certain perspective the character may seem to be showing blacks in a positive light, the character is still ultimately subordinate to whites. He or she is also regarded as an exception, allowing white America to like individual black people but not black culture.&lt;ref name="Hughey"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Cinethetic Racism: White Redemption and Black Stereotypes in 'Magical Negro' Films |first= Matthew |last=Hughey |authorlink=Matthew Hughey|pages= 543–577 |volume=25 |issue=3 |journal= [[Social Problems]] |date= August 2009 |doi= 10.1525/sp.2009.56.3.543}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001 [[Spike Lee]] used the term in a series of talks on college campuses to criticize the stereotypical, unreal roles created for black men in films that were recent at that time, naming ''[[The Family Man]]'' (2000), ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'' (1998), ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'' (1999) as examples.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news |last1=Seitz |first1=Matt Zoller |title= The offensive movie cliche that won't die |url= http://www.salon.com/2010/09/14/magical_negro_trope/ |work= Salon |date= September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talking about the time and place in which Bagger Vance is set, he said:
: "Blacks are getting lynched left and right, and [Bagger Vance is] more concerned about improving Matt Damon's golf swing!&amp;nbsp;... I gotta sit down; I get mad just thinking about it. They're still doing the same old thing&amp;nbsp;... recycling the noble savage and the happy slave." He went on to discuss his desire to create films showing black people doing all kinds of things.&lt;ref name="SpikeLee"/&gt;

In a book published in 2004, writer Krin Gabbard claimed that the Oda Mae Brown character in the 1990 movie ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', played by [[Whoopi Goldberg]], was an example of a Magical Negress.&lt;ref name=Gabbard/&gt;{{rp|154–155}}

In 2012, writer Kia Miakka Natisse, in ''[[The Grip]]'', opined about actor [[Morgan Freeman]] playing parts more or less conforming to the Magical Negro form. Natisse mentioned recent roles including the doctor fitting a dolphin with a [[prosthetic]] tail in ''[[Dolphin Tale]]'' despite the film's origin: the film is [[Winter_(dolphin)|based on a true story]]. Natisse continued to gripe: "[''[[Red_(2010_film) |Red]]''] an ailing CIA mentor—in both roles [Freeman] reprises the Magical Negro type, coming to save the day for his imperiled white counterparts. One could argue his gadget guru in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' fits under that same umbrella."&lt;ref&gt;Natisse, Kia Miakka. "[http://thegrio.com/2012/06/06/morgan-freeman-its-time-to-retire-the-magical-negro-role/ Morgan Freeman, it's time to retire the 'Magical Negro' role]". thegrio.com, June 6, 2012. Retrieved August 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Dave Chappelle]] made several references to this trope in his mid-2000's series ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', including a sketch entitled "Black Pixies". [[Chris Rock]] did likewise [[The Chris Rock Show|on his own show]] of the same period, with another, particularly critical of ''The Legend of Bagger Vance'', entitled "Migger, the Magic [[Nigger]]". More recently, [[Keegan-Michael Key]] and [[Jordan Peele]], of ''[[Mad TV|MADtv]]'' and ''[[Key and Peele]]'' fame, followed suit in both shows with their own critical Magical Negro sketches.

===Barack Obama===
In March 2007, American [[critic]] [[David Ehrenstein]] used the title "Obama the 'Magic Negro'" for an [[editorial]] he wrote for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in which he described [[Barack Obama]]'s image in white American culture: "He's there to assuage white 'guilt' (i.e., the "minimal discomfort" they feel) over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history, while replacing stereotypes of a dangerous, highly sexualized black man with a benign figure for whom interracial sexual congress holds no interest&amp;nbsp;... The only mud that momentarily stuck was criticism (white and black alike) concerning Obama's alleged 'inauthenticity', as compared to such sterling examples of "genuine" blackness as [[Al Sharpton]] and [[Snoop Dogg]].&amp;nbsp;... Obama's fame right now has little to do with his political record&amp;nbsp;... Like a comic-book superhero, Obama is there to help, out of the sheer goodness of a heart we need not know or understand. For as with all Magic Negroes, the less real he seems, the more desirable he becomes. If he were real, white America couldn't project all its fantasies of curative black benevolence on him."&lt;ref name=nonfic&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Obama the 'Magic Negro' |date=March 19, 2007| accessdate=May 12, 2010 | first=David | last=Ehrenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the Ehrenstein editorial at length, [[Rush Limbaugh]] at one point sang the words, "Barack the magic negro" to the tune of song "[[Puff, the Magic Dragon]]".&lt;ref name="driveby"&gt;Rush Limbaugh Show Transcript. March 19, 2007 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120212192156/http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2007/03/19/liberal_calls_obama_magic_negro Liberal Calls Obama "Magic Negro"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rush Limbaugh recording via Media Matters.

Song is at 11:30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after that [[Paul Shanklin]] recorded a song about Barack the Magic Negro set to that same tune, which Limbaugh played numerous times throughout the 2008 presidential election season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/us/politics/28rnc.html |title= G.O.P.

In May 2015, theater and cultural critic [[Frank Rich]], looking back at the coincidence of the [[2015 Baltimore protests]] with the annual [[White House Correspondents Association#White House Correspondents Dinner |White House Correspondents Dinner]] in [[Washington, DC]], wrote: "What made this particular instance poignant was the presence in the ballroom of our [[Barack Obama|first African-American president]], the Magic Negro who was somehow expected to relieve a nation founded and built on slavery from the toxic burdens of centuries of history."&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank.

A '''meme''' ({{IPAc-en|m|iː|m}} {{respell|MEEM}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meme|title=meme|website=Oxford Dictionaries|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meme|language=en|website=Cambridge Dictionary|title=meme Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/meme?q=meme|title=meme noun|language=en|website=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture—often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meme Meme]. ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; A meme acts as a unit for carrying [[culture|cultural]] ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to [[gene]]s in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to [[natural selection|selective pressures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graham|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents theorize that memes are a [[viral phenomenon]] that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of [[biological evolution]]. Memes do this through the processes of [[genetic diversity|variation]], [[mutation]], [[competition]], and [[heredity|inheritance]], each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that [[fecundity|propagate]] less prolifically may become [[extinction|extinct]], while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|1994 | p. 360}} "But if we consider culture as its own self-organizing system—a system with its own agenda and pressure to survive—then the history of humanity gets even more interesting. As Richard Dawkins has shown, systems of self-replicating ideas or memes can quickly accumulate their own agenda and behaviours. I assign no higher motive to a cultural entity than the primitive drive to reproduce itself and modify its environment to aid its spread. One way the self organizing system can do this is by consuming human biological resources."&lt;/ref&gt;

A field of study called [[memetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Heylighen|Chielens|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an [[evolutionary model]]. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes [[empirical]]ly. However, developments in [[Functional neuroimaging|neuroimaging]] may make empirical study possible.&lt;ref name="mcnamara"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Jameson (2011).

==Etymology==

The word ''meme'' is a shortening (modeled on ''gene'') of ''mimeme'' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|μίμημα}} {{IPA-el|míːmɛːma|pron}} ''mīmēma'', "imitated thing", from {{lang|el|μιμεῖσθαι}} ''mimeisthai'', "to imitate", from {{Lang|el|μῖμος}} ''mimos'', "mime")&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'': Fourth Edition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; coined by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976)&lt;ref name="cream"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millikan|2004|p=16}}; [https://books.google.com/books?id=YphlBwpbJCUC&amp;pg=PA16 Varieties of meaning]. "Richard Dawkins invented the term 'memes' to stand for items that are reproduced by imitation rather than reproduced genetically."&lt;/ref&gt; as a concept for discussion of [[evolution]]ary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, [[catchphrase]]s, fashion, and the technology of building arches.&lt;ref name="selfish"&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1989 | p = 352}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Pike]] coined the related terms [[emic|emic and etic]], generalizing the linguistic idea of [[phoneme]], [[morpheme]], [[grapheme]], [[lexeme]], and [[tagmeme]] (as set out by [[Leonard Bloomfield]]), characterizing them as insider view and outside view of behaviour and extending the concept into a tagmemic theory of human behaviour (culminating in ''Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behaviour'', 1954).

== Origins ==

[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|175 px|left|alt=|thumb|[[Richard Dawkins]] coined the word ''meme'' in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''.]]

The word ''meme'' originated with [[Richard Dawkins]]' 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. Dawkins cites as inspiration the work of geneticist [[L. L. Cavalli-Sforza]], anthropologist F. T. Cloak&lt;ref&gt;Cultural microevolution, 1966. Research Previews 13: (2) pp. 7–10. Also presented at the November, 1966 annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; and ethologist J. M. Cullen.&lt;ref&gt;"Is a cultural ethology possible?" ''Hum. Ecol.'' 3, 161–182. Cullen, J. M. (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins wrote that evolution depended not on the particular chemical basis of genetics, but only on the existence of a self-replicating unit of transmission—in the case of biological evolution, the gene. For Dawkins, the meme exemplified another self-replicating unit with potential significance in explaining human behavior and cultural evolution.  Although Dawkins invented the term 'meme' and developed meme theory, the possibility that ideas were subject to the same pressures of evolution as were biological attributes was discussed in Darwin's time. T. H. Huxley claimed that 'The struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world. A theory is a species of thinking, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huxley|first=T. H.|title=The coming of age of 'The origin of species'|journal=(1880) Science|volume=1, 15–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kilroy was here (re-drawn).gif|thumb|right|"[[Kilroy was here]]" was a [[Graffiti|graffito]] that became popular in the 1940s, and existed under various names in different countries, illustrating how a meme can be modified through replication. This is seen as one of the first widespread memes in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/05/books/bk-5402 |title=Kilroy Was Here - Los Angeles Times |publisher=articles.latimes.com |date=2000-03-05 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Dawkins used the term to refer to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a [[self-replication|replicator]]. He hypothesized that one could view many cultural entities as replicators, and pointed to melodies, fashions and learned skills as examples. Memes generally replicate through exposure to humans, who have evolved as efficient copiers of information and behavior. Because humans do not always copy memes perfectly, and because they may refine, combine or otherwise modify them with other memes to create new memes, they can change over time. Dawkins likened the process by which memes survive and change through the [[cultural evolution|evolution of culture]] to the natural selection of genes in biological [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="selfish"/&gt;

Dawkins defined the ''meme'' as a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation and replication, but later definitions would vary. The lack of a consistent, rigorous, and precise understanding of what typically makes up one unit of cultural transmission remains a problem in debates about [[memetics]].&lt;ref name="machine"&gt;{{harvnb|Blackmore|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the concept of genetics gained concrete evidence with the [[DNA#History of DNA research|discovery]] of the [[DNA#Biological functions|biological functions]] of [[DNA]]. Meme transmission requires a physical medium, such as photons, sound waves, touch, taste, or smell because memes can be transmitted only through the senses.

Dawkins noted that in a society with culture a person need not have descendants to remain influential in the actions of individuals thousands of years after their death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea...it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool. [[Socrates]] may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today, as [[George C. Williams (biologist)|G.C. Williams]] has remarked, but who cares? The meme-complexes of Socrates, [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Copernicus]] and [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] are still going strong.&lt;ref name="The Selfish Gene 30th Anniversary Edition section on survival"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |title=The Selfish Gene 30th Anniversary Edition |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191537554 |page=199 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Dawkins invented the term ''meme'', he has not claimed that the idea was entirely novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/formerly-hyper-weird/memetics.html |title=Memes |website=Center for the Study of Complex Systems |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=14 August 2009 |last=Shalizi |first= Cosma Rohilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past.&lt;ref name="mneme"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Laurent| first=John| year=1999| title=A Note on the Origin of 'Memes'/'Mnemes'| work=Journal of Memetics| volume=3 | issue=1| pages=14–19| url =http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/1999/vol3/laurent_j.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, [[Richard Semon]] published ''Die Mneme'' (which appeared in English in 1924 as ''The Mneme''). The term ''mneme'' was also used in [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''The Life of the White Ant'' (1926), with some parallels to Dawkins's concept.&lt;ref name=mneme/&gt;

== Memetic lifecycle: transmission, retention ==
{{See also|Diffusion of innovations}}&lt;!-- Similar process, although memes are not necessarily "innovations". Sections "Process" and "Rate of Adoption". --&gt;

Memes, analogously to genes, vary in their aptitude to replicate; successful memes remain and spread, whereas unfit ones stall and are forgotten. Thus memes that prove more effective at replicating and surviving are selected in the meme pool.

Memes first need retention. The longer a meme stays in its hosts, the higher its chances of propagation are. When a host uses a meme, the meme's life is extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heylighen|first=Francis|title=Meme replication: the memetic life-cycle|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MEMEREP.html|website=Principia Cybernetica|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reuse of the neural space hosting a certain meme's copy to host different memes is the greatest threat to that meme's copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=R. Evers|first=John|title=A justification of societal altruism according to the memetic application of Hamilton's rule|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Evers.html|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meme which increases the longevity of its hosts will generally survive longer. On the contrary, a meme which shortens the longevity of its hosts will tend to disappear faster. However, as hosts are mortal, retention is not sufficient to perpetuate a meme in the long term; memes also need transmission.

Life-forms can transmit information both vertically (from parent to child, via replication of genes) and horizontally (through viruses and other means).
Memes can replicate vertically or horizontally within a single biological generation. They may also lie dormant for long periods of time.

Memes reproduce by copying from a nervous system to another one, either by communication or [[imitation]]. Imitation often involves the copying of an [[observation|observed]] behavior of another individual. Communication may be direct or indirect, where memes transmit from one individual to another through a copy recorded in an inanimate source, such as a book or a [[Sheet music|musical score]]. Adam McNamara has suggested that memes can be thereby classified as either internal or external memes (i-memes or e-memes).&lt;ref name="mcnamara" /&gt;

Some commentators have likened the transmission of memes to the spread of [[infectious disease|contagions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blackmore|1998}}; "The term 'contagion' is often associated with memetics. We may say that certain memes are contagious, or more contagious than others."&lt;/ref&gt; Social contagions such as [[Bandwagon effect|fads]], [[Hysterical contagion|hysteria]], [[copycat crime]], and [[copycat suicide]] exemplify memes seen as the contagious imitation of ideas. Observers distinguish the contagious imitation of memes from instinctively contagious phenomena such as yawning and laughing, which they consider innate (rather than socially learned) behaviors.&lt;ref name="defmeme"&gt;{{harvnb|Blackmore|1998}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]] described seven general patterns of meme transmission, or "thought contagion":&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Quantity of parenthood'': an idea that influences the number of children one has. Children respond particularly receptively to the ideas of their parents, and thus ideas that directly or indirectly encourage a higher birthrate will replicate themselves at a higher rate than those that discourage higher birthrates.
# ''Efficiency of parenthood'': an idea that increases the proportion of children who will adopt ideas of their parents. Cultural [[separatism]] exemplifies one practice in which one can expect a higher rate of meme-replication—because the meme for separation creates a barrier from exposure to competing ideas.
# ''Proselytic'': ideas generally passed to others beyond one's own children. Ideas that encourage the [[proselytism]] of a meme, as seen in many religious or political movements, can replicate memes horizontally through a given generation, spreading more rapidly than parent-to-child meme-transmissions do.
# ''Preservational'': ideas that influence those that hold them to continue to hold them for a long time. Ideas that encourage longevity in their hosts, or leave their hosts particularly resistant to abandoning or replacing these ideas, enhance the preservability of memes and afford protection from the competition or proselytism of other memes.
# ''Adversative'': ideas that influence those that hold them to attack or sabotage competing ideas and/or those that hold them. Adversative replication can give an advantage in meme transmission when the meme itself encourages aggression against other memes.
# ''Cognitive'': ideas perceived as cogent by most in the population who encounter them. Cognitively transmitted memes depend heavily on a cluster of other ideas and cognitive traits already widely held in the population, and thus usually spread more passively than other forms of meme transmission. Memes spread in cognitive transmission do not count as self-replicating.
# ''Motivational'': ideas that people adopt because they perceive some self-interest in adopting them. Strictly speaking, motivationally transmitted memes do not self-propagate, but this mode of transmission often occurs in association with memes self-replicated in the efficiency parental, proselytic and preservational modes.

== Memes as discrete units ==

Dawkins initially defined ''meme'' as a noun that "conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of ''imitation''".&lt;ref name="selfish"/&gt; John S. Wilkins retained the notion of meme as a kernel of cultural imitation while emphasizing the meme's evolutionary aspect, defining the meme as "the least unit of sociocultural information relative to a selection process that has favorable or unfavorable selection bias that exceeds its endogenous tendency to change".&lt;ref name="wilkins"&gt;{{citation |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |title=What's in a Meme? Reflections from the perspective of the history and philosophy of evolutionary biology
|periodical=Journal of Memetics |publication-date=1998 |volume=2 |url=http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The meme as a unit provides a convenient means of discussing "a piece of thought copied from person to person", regardless of whether that thought contains others inside it, or forms part of a larger meme. A meme could consist of a single word, or a meme could consist of the entire speech in which that word first occurred. This forms an analogy to the idea of a gene as a single unit of self-replicating information found on the self-replicating [[chromosome]].

While the identification of memes as "units" conveys their nature to replicate as discrete, indivisible entities, it does not imply that thoughts somehow become [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] or that "[[atom]]ic" ideas exist that cannot be dissected into smaller pieces. A meme has no given size. [[Susan Blackmore]] writes that melodies from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s symphonies are commonly used to illustrate the difficulty involved in delimiting memes as discrete units. She notes that while the first four notes of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]] ({{Audio|Beet5mov1bars1to5.ogg|listen}}) form a meme widely replicated as an independent unit, one can regard the entire symphony as a single meme as well.&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt;

The inability to pin an idea or cultural feature to quantifiable key units is widely acknowledged as a problem for memetics. It has been argued however that the traces of memetic processing can be quantified utilizing neuroimaging techniques which measure changes in the connectivity profiles between brain regions."&lt;ref name="mcnamara"/&gt; Blackmore meets such criticism by stating that memes compare with genes in this respect: that while a [[gene]] has no particular size, nor can we ascribe every [[phenotype|phenotypic]] feature directly to a particular gene, it has value because it encapsulates that key unit of inherited expression subject to evolutionary pressures. To illustrate, she notes evolution selects for the gene for features such as eye color; it does not select for the individual nucleotide in a strand of [[DNA]]. Memes play a comparable role in understanding the evolution of imitated behaviors.&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt;

The 1981 book ''Genes, Mind, and Culture: The Coevolutionary Process'' by [[Charles J. Lumsden]] and [[E. O. Wilson]] proposed the theory that genes and culture co-evolve, and that the fundamental biological units of culture must correspond to neuronal networks that function as nodes of semantic [[memory]]. They coined their own word, "[[culturgen]]", which did not catch on. Coauthor Wilson later acknowledged the term ''meme'' as the best label for the fundamental unit of cultural inheritance in his 1998 book ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]'', which elaborates upon the fundamental role of memes in unifying the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[social sciences|social]] sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary influences on memes==
Dawkins noted the three conditions that must exist for evolution to occur:&lt;ref name="conscious"&gt;{{harvnb|Dennett|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# variation, or the introduction of new change to existing elements;
# heredity or replication, or the capacity to create copies of elements;
# differential "fitness", or the opportunity for one element to be more or less suited to the environment than another.
Dawkins emphasizes that the process of evolution naturally occurs whenever these conditions co-exist, and that evolution does not apply only to organic elements such as genes. He regards memes as also having the properties necessary for evolution, and thus sees meme evolution as not simply analogous to genetic evolution, but as a real phenomenon subject to the laws of [[natural selection]]. Dawkins noted that as various ideas pass from one [[generation]] to the next, they may either enhance or detract from the survival of the people who obtain those ideas, or influence the survival of the ideas themselves. For example, a certain culture may develop unique designs and methods of [[tool]]-making that give it a competitive advantage over another culture. Each tool-design thus acts somewhat similarly to a biological [[gene]] in that some populations have it and others do not, and the meme's function directly affects the presence of the design in future generations. In keeping with the thesis that in evolution one can regard organisms simply as suitable "hosts" for reproducing genes, Dawkins argues that one can view people as "hosts" for replicating memes. Consequently, a successful meme may or may not need to provide any benefit to its host.&lt;ref name="conscious"/&gt;

Unlike genetic evolution, memetic evolution can show both [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] and [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] traits. Cultural memes will have the characteristic of Lamarckian inheritance when a host aspires to replicate the given meme through inference rather than by exactly copying it. Take for example the case of the transmission of a simple skill such as hammering a nail, a skill that a learner imitates from watching a demonstration without necessarily imitating every discrete movement modeled by the teacher in the demonstration, stroke for stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Blackmore]] distinguishes the difference between the two modes of inheritance in the evolution of memes, characterizing the Darwinian mode as "copying the instructions" and the Lamarckian as "copying the product."&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt;

Clusters of memes, or ''[[memeplex]]es'' (also known as ''meme complexes'' or as ''memecomplexes''), such as cultural or political doctrines and systems, may also play a part in the acceptance of new memes. Memeplexes comprise groups of memes that replicate together and coadapt.&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt; Memes that fit within a successful memeplex may gain acceptance by "piggybacking" on the success of the memeplex.
As an example, John D. Gottsch discusses the transmission, mutation and selection of religious memeplexes and the theistic memes contained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/2001/vol5/gottsch_jd.html "Mutation, Selection, And Vertical Transmission Of Theistic Memes In Religious Canons"] in ''Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'', Volume 5, Issue 1, 2001. Online version retrieved 2008-01-27.
&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic memes discussed include the "prohibition of aberrant sexual practices such as incest, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, castration, and religious prostitution", which may have increased vertical transmission of the parent religious memeplex. Similar memes are thereby included in the majority of religious memeplexes, and harden over time; they become an "inviolable canon" or set of [[dogma]]s, eventually finding their way into secular [[law]]. This could also be referred to as the propagation of a [[taboo]].

==Memetics==
{{Main|Memetics}}

The discipline of memetics, which dates from the mid-1980s, provides an approach to [[evolutionary model]]s of cultural [[information transfer]] based on the concept of the meme. [[Memeticist]]s have proposed that just as memes function analogously to [[gene]]s, memetics functions analogously to [[genetics]]. Memetics attempts to apply conventional scientific methods (such as those used in [[population genetics]] and [[epidemiology]]) to explain existing patterns and transmission of [[culture|cultural]] ideas.

Principal criticisms of memetics include the claim that memetics ignores established advances in other fields of cultural study, such as [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[social psychology]]. Questions remain whether or not the meme concept counts as a [[philosophy of science|validly disprovable]] scientific theory. This view regards memetics as a theory in its infancy: a [[protoscience]] to proponents, or a [[pseudoscience]] to some detractors.

==Criticism of meme theory==
An objection to the study of the evolution of memes in genetic terms (although not to the existence of memes) involves a perceived gap in the gene/meme analogy: the cumulative evolution of genes depends on biological selection-pressures neither too great nor too small in relation to mutation-rates. There seems no reason to think that the same balance will exist in the selection pressures on memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Sterelny|Griffiths|1999}}; p. 333
&lt;/ref&gt;

Luis Benitez-Bribiesca M.D., a critic of memetics, calls the theory a "[[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[dogma]]" and "a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious study of [[consciousness]] and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]]". As a factual criticism, Benitez-Bribiesca points to the lack of a "code script" for memes (analogous to the DNA of genes), and to the excessive instability of the meme mutation mechanism (that of an idea going from one brain to another), which would lead to a low replication accuracy and a high mutation rate, rendering the evolutionary process chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;

British political philosopher [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] has characterized Dawkins' memetic theory of religion as "nonsense" and "not even a theory... the latest in a succession of ill-judged Darwinian metaphors", comparable to [[Intelligent Design]] in its value as a science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/15/society | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Gray | title=John Gray on secular fundamentalists | date=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique comes from [[semiotic]] theorists such as Deacon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deacon | first1 = Terrence | authorlink = Terrence Deacon | year = | title = The trouble with memes (and what to do about it)| url = | journal = The Semiotic Review of Books | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kull | first1 = Kalevi | authorlink = Kalevi Kull | year = 2000 | title = Copy versus translate, meme versus sign: development of biological textuality | url = | journal = European Journal for Semiotic Studies | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 101–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view regards the concept of "meme" as a primitivized concept of [[Sign (semiotics)|"sign"]]. The meme is thus described in memetics as a sign lacking a [[Sign (semiotics)#Triadic signs|triadic]] nature. Semioticians can regard a meme as a "degenerate" sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, in the broadest sense, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation and interpretation are signs.{{Clarify|date=February 2009|reason=This last paragraph could be better explained.

&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] disapproved of Dawkins' gene-based view and usage of the term "meme", asserting it to be an "unnecessary synonym" for "[[concept]]", reasoning that concepts are not restricted to an individual or a generation, may persist for long periods of time, and may evolve.&lt;ref name=pNASmayr&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr |first1=Ernst |year=1997 |title=The objects of selection |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=2091–2094 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.6.2091 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/94/6/2091.full |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6L9TOiSj0?url=http://www.pnas.org/content/94/6/2091.full |archivedate=November 15, 2013 |pmid=9122151 |pmc=33654 |deadurl=yes |df= |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.2091M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Opinions differ as to how best to apply the concept of memes within a "proper" disciplinary framework. One view sees memes as providing a useful philosophical perspective with which to examine cultural evolution. Proponents of this view (such as [[Susan Blackmore]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]) argue that considering cultural developments from a meme's-eye view—''as if'' memes themselves respond to pressure to maximise their own replication and survival—can lead to useful insights and yield valuable predictions into how culture develops over time. Others such as Bruce Edmonds and Robert Aunger have focused on the need to provide an empirical grounding for memetics to become a useful and respected [[scientific discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;
See {{citation |url=http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/2002/vol6/edmonds_b_letter.html |last=Edmonds |first=Bruce |publication-date=September 2002 |volume=6 |issue=2 |title=Three Challenges for the Survival of Memetics |work=Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission |accessdate=2009-02-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Aunger|2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A third approach, described by Joseph Poulshock, as "radical memetics" seeks to place memes at the centre of a [[Eliminative materialism|materialistic]] [[theory of mind]] and of [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poulshock|2002}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent researchers in [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[anthropology]], including [[Scott Atran]], [[Dan Sperber]], [[Pascal Boyer]], [[John Tooby]] and others, argue the possibility of incompatibility between [[modularity of mind]] and memetics.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In their view, minds structure certain communicable aspects of the ideas produced, and these communicable aspects generally trigger or elicit ideas in other minds through inference (to relatively rich structures generated from often low-fidelity input) and not high-fidelity replication or imitation. Atran discusses communication involving religious beliefs as a case in point. In one set of experiments he asked religious people to write down on a piece of paper the meanings of the [[Ten Commandments]]. Despite the subjects' own expectations of consensus, interpretations of the commandments showed wide ranges of variation, with little evidence of consensus. In another experiment, subjects with autism and subjects without autism interpreted ideological and religious sayings (for example, "Let a thousand flowers bloom" or "To everything there is a season"). People with autism showed a significant tendency to closely paraphrase and repeat content from the original statement (for example: "Don't cut flowers before they bloom"). Controls tended to infer a wider range of cultural meanings with little replicated content (for example: "Go with the flow" or "Everyone should have equal opportunity"). Only the subjects with autism—who lack the degree of inferential capacity normally associated with aspects of [[theory of mind]]—came close to functioning as "meme machines".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atran|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Robot's Rebellion'', [[Keith Stanovich|Stanovich]] uses the memes and memeplex concepts to describe a program of cognitive reform that he refers to as a "rebellion". Specifically, Stanovich argues that the use of memes as a descriptor for cultural units is beneficial because it serves to emphasize transmission and acquisition properties that parallel the study of [[epidemiology]]. These properties make salient the sometimes parasitic nature of acquired memes, and as a result individuals should be motivated to reflectively acquire memes using what he calls a "[[Neurathian bootstrap]]" process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanovich|first=Keith E.|date=2004|accessdate=|title=The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin|edition=1st|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-77089-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}

Although social scientists such as [[Max Weber]] sought to understand and explain [[religion]] in terms of a cultural attribute, Richard Dawkins called for a re-analysis of religion in terms of the evolution of self-replicating ideas ''apart from'' any resulting biological advantages they might bestow.
{{quote|As an enthusiastic Darwinian, I have been dissatisfied with explanations that my fellow-enthusiasts have offered for human behaviour. They have tried to look for 'biological advantages' in various attributes of human civilization. For instance, tribal religion has been seen as a mechanism for solidifying group identity, valuable for a pack-hunting species whose individuals rely on cooperation to catch large and fast prey. Frequently the evolutionary preconception in terms of which such theories are framed is implicitly group-selectionist, but it is possible to rephrase the theories in terms of orthodox gene selection.|[[Richard Dawkins]]|''[[The Selfish Gene]]''}}

He argued that the role of key replicator in cultural evolution belongs not to genes, but to memes replicating thought from person to person by means of imitation. These replicators respond to selective pressures that may or may not affect biological reproduction or survival.&lt;ref name="selfish"/&gt;

In her book ''The Meme Machine'', [[Susan Blackmore]] regards religions as particularly tenacious memes. Many of the features common to the most widely practiced religions provide built-in advantages in an evolutionary context, she writes. For example, religions that preach of the value of [[faith]] over [[evidence]] from everyday experience or [[reason]] inoculate societies against many of the most basic tools people commonly use to evaluate their ideas. By linking [[altruism]] with religious affiliation, religious memes can proliferate more quickly because people perceive that they can reap societal as well as personal rewards. The longevity of religious memes improves with their documentation in revered [[scripture|religious texts]].&lt;ref name="machine"/&gt;

[[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]] attributed the robustness of religious memes in human culture to the fact that such memes incorporate multiple modes of meme transmission. Religious memes pass down the generations from parent to child and across a single generation through the meme-exchange of [[proselytism]]. Most people will hold the religion taught them by their parents throughout their life. Many religions feature adversarial elements, punishing [[apostasy]], for instance, or demonizing [[infidels]]. In ''Thought Contagion'' Lynch identifies the memes of transmission in [[Christianity]] as especially powerful in scope. Believers view the conversion of non-believers both as a religious duty and as an act of altruism. The promise of [[heaven]] to believers and threat of [[hell]] to non-believers provide a strong incentive for members to retain their belief. Lynch asserts that belief in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] in Christianity amplifies each of its other replication advantages through the indebtedness believers have to their [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Savior]] for sacrifice on the cross. The image of the crucifixion recurs in religious [[sacrament]]s, and the proliferation of symbols of the [[Christian cross|cross]] in homes and churches potently reinforces the wide array of Christian memes.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt;

Although religious memes have proliferated in human cultures, the modern scientific community has been relatively resistant to religious belief. Robertson (2007) &lt;ref name=Robertson2007&gt;{{citation |author = Robertson, Lloyd Hawkeye|year=2007 | title=Reflections on the use of spirituality to privilege religion in scientific discourse: Incorporating considerations of self |journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 46|issue=3 |pages=449–461 |doi = 10.1007/s10943-006-9105-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; reasoned that if evolution is accelerated in conditions of propagative difficulty,&lt;ref name=Dennett1995&gt;{{citation |last = Dennett|first= Daniel C.|year=1995| title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the meanings of life|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; then we would expect to encounter variations of religious memes, established in general populations, addressed to scientific communities. Using a memetic approach, Robertson deconstructed two attempts to privilege religiously held spirituality in scientific discourse. Advantages of a memetic approach as compared to more traditional "modernization" and "supply side" theses in understanding the evolution and propagation of religion were explored.

==Memetic explanations of racism==
In ''Cultural Software: A Theory of Ideology'', [[Jack Balkin]] argued that memetic processes can explain many of the most familiar features of [[ideology|ideological]] thought. His theory of "cultural software" maintained that memes form [[narrative]]s, social networks, metaphoric and [[metonymy|metonymic]] models, and a variety of different mental structures. Balkin maintains that the same structures used to generate ideas about free speech or free markets also serve to generate racistic beliefs. To Balkin, whether memes become harmful or maladaptive depends on the environmental context in which they exist rather than in any special source or manner to their origination. Balkin describes racist beliefs as "fantasy" memes that &lt;!-- may? or must? --&gt;become harmful or unjust "ideologies" when diverse peoples come together, as through trade or competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balkin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural memes==
In ''[[A Theory of Architecture]]'', [[Nikos Salingaros]] speaks of memes as "freely propagating clusters of information" which can be beneficial or harmful. He contrasts memes to [[Pattern language|patterns]] and true knowledge, characterizing memes as "greatly simplified versions of patterns" and as "unreasoned matching to some visual or mnemonic prototype".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikos Salingaros]]: ''Theory of Architecture'', chapter 12: ''Architectural memes in a universe of information'', {{ISBN|3-937954-07-4}}, Umbau-Verlag, 2006, 2008, pp. 243, 260&lt;/ref&gt; Taking reference to Dawkins, Salingaros emphasizes that they can be transmitted due to their own communicative properties, that "the simpler they are, the faster they can proliferate", and that the most successful memes "come with a great psychological appeal".&lt;ref&gt;Salingaros, 2008. pp. 243–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural memes, according to Salingaros, can have destructive power. "Images portrayed in architectural magazines representing buildings that could not possibly accommodate everyday uses become fixed in our memory, so we reproduce them unconsciously."&lt;ref name="Sal08"&gt;Salingaros, 2008. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; He lists various architectural memes that circulated since the 1920s and which, in his view, have led to contemporary architecture becoming quite decoupled from human needs. They lack connection and meaning, thereby preventing "the creation of true connections necessary to our understanding of the world". He sees them as no different from [[antipattern]]s in software design—as solutions that are false but are re-utilized nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;Salingaros, 2008. p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet culture==
{{Main|Internet meme}}
{{see also|List of Internet phenomena}}

An "Internet meme" is a concept that spreads rapidly from person to person via the [[Internet]], largely through Internet-based [[E-mail]]ing, [[blog]]s, [[Internet forum|forums]], [[imageboard]]s like [[4chan]], [[social networking site]]s like [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], or [[Twitter]], [[instant messaging]], [[social news site]]s or thread sites like [[Reddit]], and [[video hosting service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-07-28-ebay-weirdness_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|first=Karen |last=Schubert|title=Bazaar goes bizarre|accessdate=2007-07-05|date=2003-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Richard Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as one deliberately altered by human creativity, distinguished from Dawkins's original idea involving mutation by random change and a form of Darwinian selection.&lt;ref name=Wired20130620&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes |title=Richard Dawkins on the internet's hijacking of the word 'meme' |last=Solon |first=Olivia |date=June 20, 2013 |website=Wired UK |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HzDGE9Go?url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes |archivedate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meme maps==
One technique of meme mapping represents the evolution and transmission of a meme across time and space.&lt;ref name=Paull2009&gt;{{Citation | author = Paull, John | year = 2009 | title = Meme Maps: A Tool for Configuring Memes in Time and Space | url = http://orgprints.org/15752/1/15752.pdf | journal = European Journal of Scientific Research | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 11–18 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a meme map uses a figure-8 diagram (an [[analemma]]) to map the gestation (in the lower loop), birth (at the choke point), and development (in the upper loop) of the selected meme. Such meme maps are nonscalar, with time mapped onto the y-axis and space onto the x-axis [[transect]]. One can read the temporal progression of the mapped meme from south to north on such a meme map. Paull has published a worked example using the "organics meme" (as in [[organic agriculture]]).&lt;ref name=Paull2009/&gt;

'''Nader Hassan Ali Kadhim''' ({{lang-ar|نادر حسن علي كاظم}}; born 1973) is a Bahraini writer, academic and [[cultural criticism|cultural critic]].

==Early life and career==

Born in the village of [[Al Dair]] in 1973, Kadhim completed his primary, intermediate and secondary education in government schools. He then enrolled in [[University of Bahrain]] where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Arabic language and literature in 1995 and [[Master's degree]] in Modern Criticism in 2001. Between 1995 and 2003 he worked as a part-time lecturer and research assistant in University of Bahrain and then as teacher in government schools. In 2003, he earned his [[PhD]] in Arabic literature from the [[Cairo]]-based [[Institute of Arab Research and Studies]] of the [[Arab League]]. He currently works as Professor of Cultural Studies at University of Bahrain. He is also the editor of two literature magazines published by the same University.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 7.5.2006"&gt;{{cite news|title=نادر كاظم|trans-title=Nader Kadhim|work=[[Al-Wasat (Bahraini newspaper)]]|accessdate=1 April 2014|language=Arabic|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1339/news/read/586592/1.html|date=7 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="15.2.2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=نادر كاظم|trans-title=Nader Kadhim|work=Al-Wasat|accessdate=1 April 2014|language=Arabic|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1623/news/read/216242/1.html|date=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 4.10.2003"&gt;{{cite news|title=نادر حسن كاظم|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/393/news/read/334759/1.html|work=Al-Wasat|accessdate=1 April 2014|date=4 October 2003|trans-title=Nader Hassan Kadhim|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="13 April 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=نادر كاظم|trans-title=Nader Kadhim|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3871/news/read/763759/1.html|work=Al-Wasat|date=13 April 2013|accessdate=1 April 2014|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Kadhim was born to a [[Shia]] family,&lt;ref name="Al-Waqt 2007"/&gt; he sees it as no more than a historical coincidence which "does not entail anything". In an interview with [[Al-Waqt|''Al-Waqt'' newspaper]], he stated that joining college in 1991 was an important turn in his life which until then had been influenced by the [[Islamic revival]] in the early 1980s. Kadhim recalled that he took part in several religious activities in his childhood. He refused to be classified as Islamist, Shia Islamist or even Shia intellectual,&lt;ref name="Al-Waqt 2007"/&gt; but considered the Islamic faith and culture that he grew up with as a paving factor to his embracing of [[postmodernism]] ideas and distancing him from [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="Al-Waqt 2007"&gt;{{cite news|author=Fadhel Adnan|title=الكاتب نادر كاظم في حوار مطول مع "الوقت": لو وجدت الصحوة الإسلامية في العشرينات أو الثلاثينات لما كان لها صدى كبير في البحرين |trans-title=Author Nader Kadhim in a lengthy interview with "''Al-Waqt''": If the Islamic Revival was present at the Twenties or Thirties, it would not have had made a significant impact in Bahrain|language=Arabic|work=[[Al-Waqt]]|date=12 August 2007|url=http://bahrainonline.org/showthread.php?t=182470|publisher=[[Bahrain Online]]&lt;!--the source is an offline copy of Al-Waqt.

In February 2007, Kadhim was honored by [[Al-Wasat (Bahraini newspaper)|''Al-Wasat'' newspaper]] for his "contributions to the intellectual and cultural" debate in Bahrain. During the event, [[Mansoor al-Jamri]], the editor-in-chief of ''Al-Wasat'' praised Kadhim for his anti-sectarian writings and said he was an exceptional writer. Several other academics and journalists praised him as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=رئيس التحرير منصور الجمري: نعتز بك يا نادر... ونشد على يديك|language=Arabic|trans-title=Editor-in-chief Mansoor al-Jamri: We are proud of you Nader... and we squeeze on your hands|accessdate=2 April 2014|date=15 February 2007|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1623/news/read/216125/1.html|work=Al-Wasat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Kadhim is author to many literature and cultural criticism articles and studies published in Bahraini and Arabic media. Between 2003 and 2013, he has published nine books, two of them earning the "Bahraini outstanding book" award in 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref name="13 April 2013"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47257">A '''narrative''' or '''story''' is a report of connected events, [[nonfiction|real]] or [[fiction|imaginary]], presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, or still or [[motion picture|moving image]]s,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Jorgen|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Cracking the enigma of asset bubbles with narratives|url=http://soq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/02/09/1476127016629880.abstract|journal=Strategic Organization|volume=15|issue=|pages=91|doi=10.1177/1476127016629880|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or both. The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'', "to tell", which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'', "knowing" or "skilled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative can be organized in a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]], and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]], and [[historical fiction]]); and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s, and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and song]]s, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances).

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]], and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[sequence (disambiguation)|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and conceptual.

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]&lt;/ref&gt; During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in [[noir fiction]] genre. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also "Narrative Aesthetics" below).

Along with [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[argumentation]], and [[description]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.

== Overview ==
A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or discourse), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature==
[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities tell our stories | https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].

[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different
[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.

In ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is ''text?''
* What is its role ([[culture]])?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?

== Literary theory ==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium--a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium--a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1345003|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1345003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|url=http://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-116|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Types of narrators and their modes==
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[Gérard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

=== Multiple narrators ===
{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172275|journal=Marvels &amp; Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar|Madagascar.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}

== Psychological approach ==
{{see also|Narrative therapy}}
Within [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hevern, V. W. (2004, March).

Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of [[Personal identity|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], and in the creation and construction of [[memories]]; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C (1992) [http://cogprints.org/266/ The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan McAdams |title=Redemptive Self: Narrative Identity in America Today |journal=The Self and Memory |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=95–116 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176933.001.0001|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a729208757~db=all~jumptype=rss|isbn=9780195176933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of [[psychosis]] and [[mental disorder]], and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: Stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }} Hyden, L.-C. &amp; Brockmeier, J.

In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

Personality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, J. B., &amp; Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:

* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (i.e., few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

== Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009)and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

=== Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid "hardened stories," or "narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures."&lt;ref name="conlea"&gt;Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical sociology approach ===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as "and" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.&lt;ref name="abell1987"&gt;Abell. P. (1987) The Syntax of Social Life: the theory and Method of Comparative Narratives, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell1993"&gt;Abell, P. (1993) Some Aspects of Narrative Method, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 18. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form "I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] "if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''" are notable items of evidence.&lt;ref name="abell2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2011"&gt;Abell, P. (2011) Singular Mechanisms and Bayesian Narratives in ed. Pierre Demeulenaere, ''Analytical Sociology and Social Mechanisms'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009a"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) History, Case Studies, Statistics and Causal Inference, ''European Sociological review'', 25, 561–569&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gloag and David Beard, Musicology: The Key Concepts (New York: Routledge, 2009), 114&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by American musicologist, [[Edward Cone]], narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion and summary — can be cited as an example.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that ‘music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt; Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a" /&gt; Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt;
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that ‘the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 116&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that discussing music in terms of [[narrativity]] is simply metaphorical and that the ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by the work's title or other programmatic information provided by the composer.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music’s ability to narrate to rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said, regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.&lt;ref&gt;Basso, 1984. "Stalking with Stories". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life. 
Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.&lt;ref name="Iseke"&gt;Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Métis community share the “Humorous Horse Story” to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt; [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3–24, quote on 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History," ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis," ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13643520|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy,|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521328462|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of retelling other people’s stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story’s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of [[personal experience]] narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29692">'''New Sincerity''' (closely related to and sometimes described as synonymous with [[post-postmodernism]]) is a trend in [[music]], [[aesthetics]], [[literary fiction]], [[film criticism]], [[poetry]], [[literary criticism]] and [[philosophy]]. It generally describes creative works that expand upon and break away from concepts of [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[irony]] and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], representing a partial return to [[modernism]]. Its usage dates back to the mid-1980s; however, it was popularized in the 1990s by [[United States|American]] author [[David Foster Wallace]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;David Foster Wallace, [http://jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Iain|date=2015-05-27|title=(New) Sincerity in David Foster Wallace's "Octet"|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00111619.2014.899199|journal=Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction|volume=56|issue=3|pages=299–314|doi=10.1080/00111619.2014.899199|issn=0011-1619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
"New Sincerity" was used as a collective name for a loose group of [[alternative rock]] bands, centered in [[Austin, Texas]] in the years from about 1985 to 1990, who were perceived as reacting to the ironic outlook of then-prominent music movements like [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]]. The use of "New Sincerity" in connection with these bands began with an off-handed comment by Austin punk rocker/author [[Jesse Sublett]] to his friend, local music writer [[Margaret Moser]]. According to author Barry Shank, Sublett said: "All those new sincerity bands, they're crap."&lt;ref name="Shank"&gt;Barry Shank, [https://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=9780819562760 ''Dissonant Identities: The Rock'N'Roll Scene in Austin, Texas''] ([[Wesleyan University Press]], 1994) ({{ISBN|9780819562760}}), p. 148–149 &amp; p.271 n.84.

Nationally, the most successful "New Sincerity" band was [[The Reivers (band)|The Reivers]] (originally called Zeitgeist), who released four well-received albums between 1985 and 1991. [[True Believers (band)|True Believers]], led by [[Alejandro Escovedo]] and [[Jon Dee Graham]], also received extensive critical praise and local acclaim in Austin, but the band had difficulty capturing its live sound on recordings, among other problems.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27102|pure_url=yes}} True Believers] at [[Allmusic]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other important "New Sincerity" bands included [[Doctors Mob]],&lt;ref&gt;Kent H.

Despite extensive critical attention (including national coverage in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and a 1985 episode of the [[MTV]] program ''[[I.R.S. Records Presents The Cutting Edge|The Cutting Edge]]''), none of the "New Sincerity" bands met with much commercial success, and the "scene" ended within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Gorski, [http://annabellemagazine.com/annabelle%20issue%2012/08Z.html Almost Famous: The Austin Texas Soundtrack Circa 1985], ''Annabelle Magazine'', No. 12 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Corcoran, "The New Sincerity: Austin in the Eighties", reprinted in Michael Corcoran, ''All Over the Map: True Heroes of Texas Music'' (University of Texas Press, 2005), {{ISBN|978-0-292-70976-8}}, pp. 150–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film criticism==
Critic Jim Collins introduced the concept of "new sincerity" to film criticism in his 1993 essay entitled “Genericity in the 90s: Eclectic Irony and the New Sincerity”. In this essay he contrasts films that treat genre conventions with "eclectic irony" and those that treat them seriously, with "new sincerity". Collins describes&lt;blockquote&gt;
the 'new sincerity' of films like ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989), ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' (1990), and ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), all of which depend not on hybridization, but on an "ethnographic" rewriting of the classic genre film that serves as their inspiration, all attempting, using one strategy or another, to recover a lost "purity", which apparently pre-existed even the Golden Age of film genre.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Collins, “Genericity in the 90s: Eclectic Irony and the New Sincerity” in Jim Collins, Hilary Radner and Ava Preacher Collins, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=oDwTPU8l2RQC ''Film Theory Goes to the Movies''] (New York: Routledge, 1993) ({{ISBN|0415905761}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-90576-3}}), p. 242, 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other critics have suggested "new sincerity" as a descriptive term for work by American filmmakers such as [[Wes Anderson]], [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Todd Louiso]], [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Charlie Kaufman]], [[Zach Braff]], and [[Jared Hess]],&lt;ref&gt;Brannon M. Hancock, [http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol9No2/HancockCommunity.htm "A Community of Characters – the Narrative Self in the Films of Wes Anderson"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724015633/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol9No2/HancockCommunity.htm |date=2008-07-24 }}, ''The Journal of Religion and Film'', vol. 9, no. 2 (October 2005), citing Mark Olsen, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1069/is_1_35/ai_53705833/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 "If I Can Dream: The Everlasting Boyhoods of Wes Anderson"], ''[[Film Comment]]'', 35/1 (January/February 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and filmmakers from other countries such as [[Michel Gondry]], [[Lars von Trier]], the [[Dogme 95]] movement, [[Aki Kaurismäki]], and [[Pedro Almodóvar]].&lt;ref name="Yurchak"&gt;Alexei Yurchak, "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today", in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H.

"&lt;ref name="Yurchak" /&gt;

==In literary fiction and criticism ==
In response to the hegemony of metafictional and self-conscious irony in contemporary fiction, writer [[David Foster Wallace]] predicted, in his 1993 essay "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a new literary movement which would espouse something like the New Sincerity ethos:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The next real literary “rebels” in this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of anti-rebels, born oglers who dare somehow to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse and instantiate single-entendre principles. Who treat of plain old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew self-consciousness and hip fatigue. These anti-rebels would be outdated, of course, before they even started. Dead on the page. Too sincere. Clearly repressed. Backward, quaint, naive, anachronistic. Maybe that’ll be the point. Maybe that’s why they’ll be the next real rebels. Real rebels, as far as I can see, risk disapproval. The old postmodern insurgents risked the gasp and squeal: shock, disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism, anarchism, nihilism. Today’s risks are different. The new rebels might be artists willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the “Oh how banal”. To risk accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Of overcredulity. Of softness. Of willingness to be suckered by a world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above imprisonment without law. Who knows."&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was further examined on the blog ''Fiction Advocate by Mike Moats:''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fictionadvocate.com/2012/09/19/the-infinite-jest-liveblog-what-happened-pt-2/|title=The Infinite Jest Liveblog: What Happened, Pt. 2|last=Mike|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The theory is this: ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' is Wallace’s attempt to both manifest and dramatize a revolutionary fiction style that he called for in his essay “E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction.” The style is one in which a new sincerity will overturn the ironic detachment that hollowed out contemporary fiction towards the end of the 20th century. Wallace was trying to write an antidote to the cynicism that had pervaded and saddened so much of American culture in his lifetime.  He was trying to create an entertainment that would get us talking again."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his 2010 essay "David Foster Wallace and the New Sincerity in American Fiction", Adam Kelly argues that Wallace's fiction, and that of his generation, is marked by a revival and theoretical reconception of sincerity, challenging the emphasis on authenticity that dominated twentieth-century literature and conceptions of the self.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Adam Kelly.

==In philosophy==
"New sincerity" has also sometimes been used to refer to a philosophical concept deriving from the basic tenets of [[performatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Eshelman, [http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0602/perform.htm "Performatism, or the End of Postmodernism"] in ''Anthropoetics'' 6 (2000/2001). See also his book, ''Performatism or the End of Postmodernism''. Davies Group: Aurora, Colorado 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen as one of the key characteristics of [[metamodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Timotheus Vermeulen &amp; Robin van den Akker, [http://www.aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677 "Notes on metamodernism"] in ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture'' 2 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Related literature includes Wendy Steiner's ''The Trouble with Beauty'' and [[Elaine Scarry]]'s ''On Beauty and Being Just''. Related movements may include [[post-postmodernism]], [[New Puritans]], [[Stuckism]], the [[Kitsch movement]] and [[remodernism]], as well as the [[Dogme 95]] film movement led by [[Lars von Trier]] and others.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==As a cultural movement==
"The New Sincerity" has been espoused since 2002 by radio host [[Jesse Thorn]] of [[Public Radio International|PRI]]'s ''[[The Sound of Young America]]'' (now ''Bullseye''), self-described as "the public radio program about things that are awesome". Thorn characterizes New Sincerity as a cultural movement defined by dicta including "Maximum Fun" and "Be More Awesome". It celebrates outsized celebration of joy, and rejects irony, and particularly ironic appreciation of cultural products. Thorn has promoted this concept on his program and in interviews&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kharakh, [http://gothamist.com/2006/11/02/jesse_thorn_ame.php "Jesse Thorn, America's Radio Sweetheart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929115220/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/02/jesse_thorn_ame.php |date=2008-09-29 }} in [[Gothamist]], posted November 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis McCafferty, [http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070114/070114tech.html "Top podcast picks: Favorites from experts in their category"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[USA Weekend]], January 14, 2007.

Solomon, ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p.258 n.3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]]. ("In the United States, the term 'new sincerity' has been popularized since 9/11 by some youth media (for example, by Jesse Thorn, the host of a popular music program ''Sound of Young America'', on New York's National Public Radio station WNYC").)&lt;/ref&gt; A typical explication of Thorn's concept is this 2006 "Manifesto for the New Sincerity":&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is The New Sincerity? Think of it as irony and sincerity combined like [[Voltron]], to form a new movement of astonishing power. Or think of it as the absence of irony and sincerity, where less is (obviously) more. If those strain the brain, just think of [[Evel Knievel]]. Let's be frank. There's no way to appreciate Evel Knievel literally. Evel is the kind of man who defies even fiction, because the reality is too over the top. Here is a man in a red-white-and-blue leather jumpsuit, driving some kind of rocket car. A man who achieved fame and fortune jumping over things. Here is a real man who feels at home as [[Spider-Man|Spidey]] on the cover of a comic book. Simply put, Evel Knievel boggles the mind. But by the same token, he isn't to be taken ironically, either. The fact of the matter is that Evel is, in a word, awesome. . . . Our greeting: a double thumbs-up. Our credo: "Be More Awesome". Our lifestyle: "Maximum Fun". Throw caution to the wind, friend, and live The New Sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Thorn, [http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2006/02/manifesto-for-new-sincerity.html "A Manifesto for The New Sincerity"], February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a September 2009 interview, Thorn commented that "new sincerity" had begun as "a silly, philosophical movement that me and some friends made up in college" and that "everything that we said was a joke, but at the same time it wasn’t all a joke in the sense that we weren’t being arch or we weren’t being campy. While we were talking about ridiculous, funny things we were sincere about them."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Valania, [http://www.phawker.com/2009/09/15/qa-with-jesse-thorn-americas-radio-sweetheart/ "Q&amp;A: With Jesse Thorn, America’s Radio Sweetheart"], ''Phawker'', September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorn's concept of "new sincerity" as a social response has gained popularity since his introduction of the term in 2002. Several point to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent wake of events that created this movement, in which there was a drastic shift in tone. The 1990s were considered a period of artistic works ripe with irony, and the attacks shocked a change in the American culture. Graydon Carter, editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', published an editorial a few weeks after the attacks claiming that "this was the end of the age of irony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/2001/09/25/irony_lives/ | title = Irony is dead! Long live irony! | first = David | last = Beers | date = September 25, 2001 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | work = [[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan D. Fitzgerald for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' suggests this new movement could also be attributed to broader periodic shifts that occur in culture.&lt;ref name="atlantic 2012"/&gt;

As a result of this movement, several cultural works, including many identified above, were considered elements of "new sincerity",&lt;ref name="atlantic 2012"/&gt; but this was also seen to be a mannerism adopted by the general public, to show appreciation for cultural works that they happened to enjoy. Andrew Watercutter of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' saw this as having being able to enjoy one's [[guilty pleasure]]s without having to feel guilty about enjoying it, and being able to share that appreciation with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2010/09/new-sincerity/ | title = Sincerely Ours: Glee‘s Success Cements Age of Geeky ‘New Sincerity’ | first = Angela | last = Watercutter | date = September 21, 2010 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example of a "new sincerity" movement is the [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|brony fandom]], generally adult and primarily male fans of the 2010 animated show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' which is produced by [[Hasbro]] to sell its toys to young girls. These fans have been called "internet neo-sincerity at its best", unabashedly enjoying the show and challenging the preconceived gender roles that such a show ordinarily carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | title = Curious about Bronies? | url = http://www.cbc.ca/q/blog/2011/12/07/curious-about-bronies/ | format = [[Adobe Flash]] | date = 2011-12-07 | accessdate = 2011-12-07 | publisher = [[CBC Radio]] | medium = Radio broadcast | first = Jian | last = Ghomeshi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired brony"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/ | title = My Little Pony Corrals Unlikely Fanboys Known as 'Bronies' | first= Angela| last = Watchcutter | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-06-09 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conception of "new sincerity" meant the avoidance of cynicism, but not necessarily of irony. In the words of Professor [[Alexei Yurchak]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref name="Yurchak n1"&gt;[http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/users/alexei-yurchak Alexei Yurchak biography] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] Department of Anthropology website (retrieved February 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; it "is a particular brand of irony, which is sympathetic and warm, and allows its authors to remain committed to the ideals that they discuss, while also being somewhat ironic about this commitment".&lt;ref name="Yurchak n1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yurchak, at p.259 n.6, further explains this contrast in terms of [[Susan Sontag]]'s comment that a good writer should "Be serious. By which I meant: never be cynical. And which doesn't preclude being funny." (Citing Sontag as quoted in Jenny Diski, "Seriously Uncool", ''[[London Review of Books]]'' 29, no. 6 (March 22, 2007).)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays New Sincerity is being contraposed not to Soviet literature, but to [[postmodernism]]. [[Dmitry Vodennikov]] has been acclaimed as the leader of the new wave of Russian New Sincerity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/2006/8/vo9.html |title=Журнальный зал.

Since 2005, poets including Reb Livingston, Joseph Massey, Andrew Mister, and Anthony Robinson have collaborated in a [[blog]]-driven poetry movement, described by Massey as "a ‘new sincerity’ brewing in American poetry—a contrast to the cold, irony-laden poetry dominating the journals and magazines and new books of poetry".&lt;ref&gt;Katy Henriksen, [http://www.econoculture.com/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=414&amp;Itemid=45 " Drunk Bunnies, The New Sincerity, Flarf: How Blogs are Transforming Poetry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110223025/http://econoculture.com/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=414&amp;Itemid=45 |date=2007-11-10 }}, ''EconoCulture'', January 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets named as associated with this movement, or its tenets, have included [[David Berman (musician)|David Berman]], [[Catherine Wagner]], [[Dean Young (poet)|Dean Young]], [[Matt Hart (poet)|Matt Hart]], [[Miranda July]],&lt;ref name="htmlgiant"&gt;http://htmlgiant.com/haut-or-not/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-the-new-sincerity/ Jameson, A.D.

'''Nomadic pastoralism''' is a form of [[pastoralism]] when [[livestock]] are [[herding|herded]] in order to find fresh [[pasture]]s on which to [[graze]]. Strictly speaking, true nomads follow an irregular pattern of movement, in contrast with [[transhumance]] where seasonal pastures are fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | title =Pastoralists in the new millennium | publisher =FAO | year =2001 | pages =11–12 | url = http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However this distinction is often not observed and the term nomad used for both—in historical cases the regularity of movements is often unknown in any case.  The herded livestock include [[cattle]], [[yak]]s, [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[reindeer]], [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s or [[camel]]s, or mixtures of species.  [[Nomad]]ic pastoralism is commonly practised in regions with little [[arable land]], typically in the [[developing world]], especially in the steppe lands north of the agricultural zone of Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart|last = Pollard, Rosenberg, and Tignor|first = Elizabeth, Clifford, and Robert|publisher = W.W.

Increasing numbers of stock may lead to [[overgrazing]] of the area and [[desertification]] if lands are not allowed to fully recover between one grazing period and the next.  Increased [[enclosure]] and fencing of land has reduced the amount of land available for this practice. There is substantive uncertainty over the extent to which the various causes for degradation affect grassland. Different causes have been identified which include overgrazing, mining, agricultural reclamation, pests and rodents, soil properties, tectonic activity, and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Peter|last2=Azadi|first2=Hossein|date=2010|title=Rangeland degradation in North China: Perceptions of pastoralists|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935109002266|journal=Environmental Research|volume=110|issue=3|pages=302–307|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2009.12.007|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, it is maintained that some, such as overgrazing and overstocking, may be overstated while others, such as climate change, mining and agricultural reclamation, may be under reported. In this context, there is also uncertainty as to the long term effect of human behavior on the grassland as compared to non-biotic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=P.|date=2001|title=Rangeland Degradation in North China Revisited?

==Origin==
[[File:Sheep and herder India.jpg|thumb|right|A boy herding a flock of sheep in [[India]]]]
[[Nomad]]ic pastoralism was a result of the [[Neolithic revolution]]. During the revolution, humans began [[domestic animals|domesticating]] animals and plants for food and started forming cities.  Nomadism generally has existed in symbiosis with such settled cultures trading animal products (meat, hides, wool, cheeses and other animal products) for manufactured items not produced by the nomadic herders. [[Henri Fleisch]] tentatively suggested the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] [[industry (archaeology)|industry]] of [[Lebanon]] may date to the [[Epipaleolithic]] and that it may have been used by one of the first cultures of [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s in the [[Beqaa valley]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

BSPF, vol. 63, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew Sherratt demonstrates that "early farming populations used livestock mainly for meat, and that other applications were explored as agriculturalists adapted to new conditions, especially in the semi‐arid zone."&lt;ref&gt;Sherratt, Andrew (1983), "The secondary exploitation of animals in the Old World" in (World Archaeology Volume 15, Issue 1, 1983 Special Issue: Transhumance and pastoralism)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Young Maasai herder Kenya, 1979.jpg|thumb|left|A young [[Maasai people|Maasai]] cattle herder in [[Kenya]].]]

In the past it was asserted that pastoral nomads left no presence archaeologically or were impoverished, but this has now been challenged,&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Cribb|Cribb, R]] (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TFnE3YQ6VjsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Roger+Cribb+Nomads+in+Archaeology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GQhMK7iLWU&amp;sig=sgRIFouHxgGnJI-O80QymPtIIrc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p54JTKWMG4a4NbKRgLYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nomads in Archaeology.] Cambridge University Press. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; and was clearly not so for many ancient [[Eurasian nomad]]s, who have left very rich [[kurgan]] burial sites.  Pastoral nomadic sites are identified based on their location outside the zone of agriculture, the absence of grains or grain-processing equipment, limited and characteristic architecture, a predominance of sheep and goat bones, and by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] [[analogy]] to modern pastoral nomadic peoples&lt;ref&gt;Oriental Institute of Chicago "Nomads, Tribes, and the State in the Ancient Near East: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives".&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Juris Zarins]] has proposed that pastoral nomadism began as a cultural lifestyle in the wake of the 6200 BC climatic crisis when [[Harifian]] pottery making hunter-gatherers in the Sinai fused with [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] agriculturalists to produce the [[Munhata]]&lt;ref&gt;Perrot J. (1964), "Les deux premières campagnes de fouilles à Munhata" Syria XLI pp. 323-45&lt;/ref&gt; culture, a nomadic lifestyle based on animal [[domestication]], developing into the [[Yarmoukian]]&lt;ref&gt;Mellaart, James (1975), The Neolithic of the Near East (London: Thames and Hudson), pp. 239-241&lt;/ref&gt; and thence into a circum-Arabian nomadic pastoral complex, and spreading [[Proto-Semitic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Zarins, Juris (1992) "Pastoral Nomadism in Arabia: Ethnoarchaeology and the Archaeological Record," in O. Bar-Yosef and A. Khazanov, eds. "Pastoralism in the Levant"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Bronze Age]] Central Asia, nomadic populations are associated with the earliest transmissions of [[millet]] and [[wheat]] grains through the region that eventually became central for the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="spengler_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spengler|first1=Robert|last2=Frachetti|first2=Michael|last3=Doumani|first3=Paula|last4=Rouse|first4=Lynne|last5=Cerasetti|first5=Barbara|last6=Bullion|first6=Elissa|last7=Mar'yashev|first7=Alexei|title=Early agriculture and crop transmission among Bronze Age mobile pastoralists of Central Eurasia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date=22 May 2014|volume=281|issue=1783|pages=20133382|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.3382|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1783/20133382|accessdate=1 May 2018|language=en|issn=0962-8452|pmc=3996608}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the medieval period in Central Asia, nomadic communities exhibited isotopically diverse diets, suggesting a multitude of subsistence strategies.&lt;ref name="hermes_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hermes|first1=Taylor R.|last2=Frachetti|first2=Michael D.|last3=Bullion|first3=Elissa A.|last4=Maksudov|first4=Farhod|last5=Mustafokulov|first5=Samariddin|last6=Makarewicz|first6=Cheryl A.|title=Urban and nomadic isotopic niches reveal dietary connectivities along Central Asia’s Silk Roads|journal=Scientific Reports|date=26 March 2018|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-22995-2|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22995-2|accessdate=1 May 2018|language=En|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomadic pattern==
[[File:Reindeer milking.jpg|thumb|right| Reindeer milking in a forest; western [[Finnmark]], late 1800s]]
Often traditional nomadic groups settle into a regular seasonal pattern of transhumance. An example of a normal nomadic cycle in the northern hemisphere is:
* Spring (early April to the end of June) — transition
* Summer (end of June to late September) — a higher plateau
* Autumn (mid-September to end of November) — transition
* Winter (from December to the end of March) — [[desert]] plains.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Lois (1991) "Nomad: a year in the life of nomadic Qashqa'i tribesman in Iran" (University of California Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The movements in this example are about 180 to 200&amp;nbsp;km. Camps are established in the same place each year; often semi-permanent shelters are built in at least one place on this migration route.

In sub-regions such as Chad, the nomadic pastoralist cycle is as follows:
* In the rainy season, the groups live in a village intended for a comfortable stay. The villages are often made of sturdy material as clay. Old men and women remain in this village when the other people move the herds in the dry season.
* In the dry season, the people move their herds to southern villages with a more temporary character. They then move inland, where they stay in tent camps.

In Chad, the sturdy villages are called hillé, the less sturdy villages are called dankhout and the tents ferik.&lt;ref&gt;Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen{{date}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--By contrast, pastoral nomads follow a seasonal migratory pattern, which varies from year-to-year depending on grazing needs. Such nomadic societies create no permanent settlements, but live in tents or other movable dwellings the year round. Pastoralist nomads are often self-sufficient, producing their own food, shelter and other needs. The people are of Desertic areas. --- This is pure WP:OR without a ref--&gt;

==David Christian's account==
[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] made the following observations about pastoralism.&lt;ref&gt; David Christian, A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, 1998, pp 81-98 and passim&lt;/ref&gt; The agriculturist lives from domesticated plants and the pastoralist lives from domesticated animals. Since animals are higher on the food chain, pastoralism supports a thinner population than agriculture. Pastoralism predominates where low rainfall makes farming impractical. Full pastoralism required the [[Secondary products revolution]] when animals began to be used for wool, milk, riding and traction as well as meat.  Where grass is poor herds must be moved, which leads to nomadism. Some peoples are fully nomadic while others live in sheltered winter camps and lead their herds into the steppe in summer. Some nomads travel long distances, usually north in summer and south in winter. Near mountains, herds are led uphill in summer and downhill in winter ([[transhumance]]). Pastoralists often trade with or raid their agrarian neighbors.

Christian distinguished ‘Inner Eurasia’, which was pastoral with a few hunter-gatherers in the far north, from ‘Outer Eurasia’, a crescent of agrarian civilizations from Europe through India to China. High civilization is based on agriculture where tax-paying peasants support landed aristocrats, kings, cities, literacy and scholars. Pastoral societies are less developed and as a result, according to Christian, more egalitarian. One tribe would often dominate its neighbors, but these ‘empires’ usually broke up after a hundred years or so. The heartland of pastoralism is the [[Eurasian steppe]]. In the center of Eurasia pastoralism extended south to Iran and surrounded agrarian oasis cities. When pastoral and agrarian societies went to war, horse-borne mobility counterbalanced greater numbers. Attempts by agrarian civilizations to conquer the steppe usually failed until the last few centuries. Pastoralists frequently raided and sometimes collected regular tribute from their farming neighbors. Especially in north China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Peter|date=2000|title=The Myth of Desertification at China’s Northwestern Frontier: The Case of Ningxia Province, 1929-1958|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009770040002600304|journal=Modern China|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=348–395|doi=10.1177/009770040002600304|issn=0097-7004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iran, they would sometimes conquer agricultural societies, but these dynasties were usually short-lived and broke up when the nomads became ‘civilized’ and lost their warlike virtues.

==Nomadic pastoralism around the world==
[[File:Hargeisa camel trader.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A [[camel]] trader in [[Hargeisa]], [[Somalia]].]]
Nomadic pastoralism was historically widespread throughout less fertile regions of Earth. It is found in areas of low rainfall such as the [[Arabian Peninsula]] inhabited by [[Bedouin]]s, as well as [[Northeast Africa]] inhabited by [[Somali people|Somalis]] (where camel, sheep and goat nomadic pastoralism is especially common).&lt;ref name="Lewisapd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=A Pastoral Democracy|year=1999|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=3825830845|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yoMBQCr4LysC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomadic transhumance is also common in areas of harsh climate, such as [[Northern Europe]] and Russia inhabited by the indigenous [[Sami people]], [[Nenets people]] and [[Chukchis]]. There are an estimated 30-40 million nomads in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020827162704/http://www.newint.org/issue266/facts.htm NOMADS - The FACTS]&lt;/ref&gt; Pastoral nomads and semi-nomadic pastoralists form a significant but declining minority in such countries as [[Saudi Arabia]] (probably less than 3%), [[Iran]] (4%), and [[Afghanistan]] (at most 10%). They comprise less than 2% of the population in the countries of North Africa except [[Libya]] and [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;Dale Eickelman, The Middle East and Central Asia. An Anthropological Approach. Fourth Edition. Prentice Hall, 2002, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eurasian steppe]] has been largely populated by nomads since early prehistoric times, with a succession of peoples known by the names given to them by surrounding literate societies, including the [[Scythians]], [[Saka]] and [[Yuezhi]].

The [[Mongols]] in what is now [[Mongolia]], Russia and China, and the [[Tatars]] or [[Turkic people]] of Eastern Europe and [[nomadic pastoralism in Central Asia|Central Asia]] were nomadic people who practiced nomadic transhumance on harsh Asian [[steppe]]s.  Some remnants of these populations are nomadic to this day. In Mongolia, about 40% of the population continues to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongoliatoday.com/info/country_briefs.html Mongolia Today - online magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122121909/http://www.mongoliatoday.com/info/country_briefs.html |date=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[China]], it is estimated that a little over five million herders are dispersed over the pastoral counties, and more than 11 million over the semi-pastoral counties. This brings the total of the (semi)nomadic herder population to over 16 million, in general living in remote, scattered and resource-poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Peter|date=2016|title=Empty institutions, non-credibility and pastoralism: China’s grazing ban, mining and ethnicity|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2016.1239617|journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1145–1176|doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1239617|issn=0306-6150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nomad-Tuaregs.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomads in southern [[Algeria]]]]
In the Middle Hills and [[Himalaya]] of [[Nepal]], people living above about 2,000 m practise [[transhumance]] and nomadic pastoralism because settled agriculture becomes less productive due to steep slopes, cooler temperatures and limited irrigation possibilities.  Distances between summer and winter pasture may be short, for example in the vicinity of [[Pokhara]] where a valley at about 800 meters elevation is less than 20&amp;nbsp;km. from alpine pastures just below the [[Annapurna]] Himalaya, or distances may be 100&amp;nbsp;km or more.  For example, in [[Rapti zone]] some 100&amp;nbsp;km west of Pokhara the [[Kham Magar]] move their herds between winter pastures just north of India and summer pastures on the southern slopes of [[Dhaulagiri]] Himalaya.  In far western Nepal, ethnic Tibetans living in Dolpo and other valleys north among the high Himalaya moved their herds north to winter on the plains of the upper [[Yarlung Zangbo River|Brahmaputra]] basin in [[Tibet]] proper, until this practice was prohibited after [[Invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|China took over Tibet]] in 1950-51.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The nomadic [[Sami people]], an indigenous people of northern Finland, Sweden, Norway, and the [[Kola Peninsula]] of Russia, practise a form of nomadic transhumance based on [[reindeer]]. In the 14th and 15th century, when reindeer population was sufficiently reduced that Sami could not subsist on hunting alone, some Sami, organized along family lines, became reindeer herders. Each family has traditional territories on which they herd, arriving at roughly the same time each season. Only a small fraction of Sami have subsisted on reindeer herding over the past century; as the most colorful part of the population, they are well known. But as elsewhere in Europe, transhumance is dying out.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The [[Mesta]] was an association of sheep owners, ([[Spanish nobility]] and [[religious order]]s) that had an important economic and political role in [[kingdom of Castile|medieval Castile]]. To preserve the [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights of way]] of its transhumant herds through ''[[Glen|cañada]]s'', the Mesta acted against small peasants.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In Chad, nomadic pastoralists include the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Kreda]], and [[Mimi (people)|Mimi]]. Farther north in [[Egypt]] and western [[Libya]], the [[Bedouins]] also practice pastoralism.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Cross-border pastoralism==
Sometimes nomadic pastoralists move their herds across international borders in search of new grazing terrain or for trade. This cross-border activity can occasionally lead to tensions with national governments as this activity is often informal and beyond their control and regulation. In East Africa, for example, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from [[Ethiopia]] sold to [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]] and [[Djibouti]] generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Pavanello, Sara 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4997&amp;title=working-across-borders-harnessing-potential-cross-border-activities-improve-livelihood-security-horn-africa-drylands Working across borders - Harnessing the potential of cross-border activities to improve livelihood security in the Horn of Africa drylands]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

There have been initiatives seeking to promote cross-border trade and also document it, in order to both stimulate regional growth and food security, but also to allow the effective vaccination of livestock.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Initiatives include Regional Resilience Enhancement Against Drought (RREAD), the Enhanced Livelihoods in Mandera Triangle/Enhanced Livelihoods in Southern Ethiopia (ELMT/ELSE) as part of the Regional Enhanced Livelihoods in Pastoral Areas (RELPA) programme in East Africa, and the Regional Livelihoods Advocacy Project (REGLAP) funded by the [[European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office|European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO)]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

A widespread observation is that a great [[skilled worker|talent]] has a free spirit.

The '''origin of speech''' refers to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]] in the context of the physiological
development of the human [[speech organs]] such as the   [[tongue]], [[lip]]s and [[Place of articulation|vocal organs]] used to produce [[Phoneme|phonological units]] in [[human universal|all human languages]].

==Background==
Although related to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]], the [[evolution]] of distinctively human [[speech]] capacities has become a distinct and in many ways separate area of scientific research.&lt;ref name="Hockett 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F. | author1link = Charles F.

Speech is in this sense optional, although it is the default modality for language.[[Image:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|250px|Places of articulation (passive and active):&lt;br /&gt;1.

Uncontroversially, monkeys, apes and humans, like many other animals, have evolved specialised mechanisms for producing ''sound'' for purposes of social communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kelemen, G. (1963). Comparative anatomy and performance of the vocal organ in vertebrates. In R. Busnel (ed.), ''Acoustic behavior of animals.'' Amsterdam:  Elsevier, pp. 489–521.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, no monkey or ape uses its ''tongue'' for such purposes.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Riede | first1 = T. | last2 = Bronson | first2 = E. | last3 = Hatzikirou | first3 = H. | last4 = Zuberbühler | first4 = K. | title = Vocal production mechanisms in a non-human primate: morphological data and a model. | journal = [[J Hum Evol]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–96 |date=Jan 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.10.002 | PMID = 15656937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Riede|first1=T.| last2=Bronson|first2=E.|last3=Hatzikirou |first3=H.| last4=Zuberbühler| first4=K.|title=Multiple discontinuities in nonhuman vocal tracts&amp;nbsp;— A reply|journal=Journal of Human Evolution| volume=50| issue=2|year=2006| pages=222–225|url=https://www.academia.edu/335565/Multiple_discontinuities_in_nonhuman_vocal_tracts_-_A_response_to_Lieberman|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our species' unprecedented use of the tongue, lips and other moveable parts seems to place speech in a quite separate category, making its evolutionary emergence an intriguing theoretical challenge in the eyes of many scholars.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000" /&gt;

==Modality-independence==
[[Image:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[angular gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[supramarginal gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green and the [[auditory cortex|primary auditory cortex]] is represented in pink.]]
The term ''[[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]'' means the chosen representational format for encoding and transmitting information. A striking feature of language is that it is ''modality-independent.'' Should an impaired child be prevented from hearing or producing sound, its innate capacity to master a language may equally find expression in signing. Sign languages of the deaf are independently invented and have all the major properties of spoken language except for the modality of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, W. C. 1960. ''Sign language structure: an outline of the communicative systems of the American deaf.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstock Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellugi, U. and E. S. Klima 1975. Aspects of sign language and its structure. In J. F. Kavanagh and J. E. Cutting (eds), ''The Role of Speech in Language.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, pp. 171 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickok 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Bellugi | first2 = U. | last3 = Klima | first3 = ES. | title = The neurobiology of sign language and its implications for the neural basis of language. | journal = Nature | volume = 381 | issue = 6584 | pages = 699–702 |date=Jun 1996 | doi = 10.1038/381699a0 | pmid = 8649515 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kegl 1999"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Kegl| first1 = Judy | last2 = Senghas| first2 = Ann | last3 = Coppola| first3 = Marie | title = Creation through Contact: Sign Language Emergence and Sign Language Change in Nicaragua / Judy Kegl, Ann Senghas, Marie Coppola| editors = Michel DeGraff | work = Language creation and language change : creolization, diachrony, and development| year = 1999 | publisher = MIT Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn = 978-0-262-04168-3| oclc = 39508250}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this it appears that the [[language center|language centres]] of the human brain must have evolved to function optimally irrespective of the selected modality.

{{quotation|"The detachment from modality-specific inputs may represent a substantial change in neural organization, one that affects not only imitation but also communication; only humans can lose one modality (e.g. hearing) and make up for this deficit by communicating with complete competence in a different modality (i.e. signing)."|{{Citation|title=''Marc Hauser, Noam Chomsky and W.

This feature is extraordinary. Animal communication systems routinely combine visible with audible properties and effects, but not one is modality-independent. No vocally impaired whale, dolphin or songbird, for example, could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, in the case of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from intrinsic properties of the signal.

Modality independence should not be confused with the ordinary phenomenon of multimodality. Monkeys and apes rely on a repertoire of species-specific "gesture-calls"&amp;nbsp;— emotionally expressive vocalisations inseparable from the visual displays which accompany them.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burling | first1 = R | year = 1993 | title = Primate calls, human language, and nonverbal communication | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 25–53 | doi=10.1086/204132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans also have species-specific gesture-calls&amp;nbsp;— laughs, cries, sobs and so forth&amp;nbsp;— together with involuntary gestures accompanying speech.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin. C. 1872. ''The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.'' London: Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P. 1982. ''Emotion in the Human Face,'' 2nd Edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, D. 1992. ''Hand and Mind. What gestures reveal about thought.'' Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many animal displays are polymodal in that each appears designed to exploit multiple channels simultaneously.

The human linguistic property of "modality independence" is conceptually distinct from this. It allows the speaker to encode the informational content of a message in a single channel, while switching between channels as necessary. Modern city-dwellers switch effortlessly between the spoken word and writing in its various forms&amp;nbsp;— handwriting, typing, e-mail and so forth. Whichever modality is chosen, it can reliably transmit the full message content without external assistance of any kind. When talking on the telephone, for example, any accompanying facial or manual gestures, however natural to the speaker, are not strictly necessary. When typing or manually signing, conversely, there's no need to add sounds. In many Australian Aboriginal cultures, a section of the population&amp;nbsp;— perhaps women observing a ritual taboo&amp;nbsp;— traditionally restrict themselves for extended periods to a silent (manually signed) version of their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kendon, A. 1988. ''Sign Languages of Aboriginal Australia.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, when released from the taboo, these same individuals resume narrating stories by the fireside or in the dark, switching to pure sound without sacrifice of informational content.

==Evolution of the speech organs==
[[Image:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal tract]]
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. Humans' first recourse is to encode our thoughts in sound&amp;nbsp;— a method which depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus.

The speech organs, everyone agrees, evolved in the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The evolution of speech: a comparative review. | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 258–267 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01494-7 | pmid = 10859570 | url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic151491.files/Fitch2000TICS.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apes use their highly flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing.   When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006" /&gt; ''Either'' it is performing gymnastics with its tongue ''or'' it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, ''Homo sapiens'' is exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion to the radically different requirements of articulate speech.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, Peter, 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tongue===
[[Image:Spectrogram -iua-.png|250px|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of American English vowels {{IPA|[i, u, ɑ]}} showing the formants ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
The word "language" derives from the Latin ''lingua,'' "tongue". Phoneticians agree that the tongue is the most important speech articulator, followed by the lips. A natural language can be viewed as a particular way of using the tongue to express thought.

The human tongue has an unusual shape. In most mammals, it's a long, flat structure contained largely within the mouth. It is attached at the rear to the [[hyoid bone]], situated below oral level in the [[pharynx]]. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended [[pharynx]], where it is attached to a hyoid bone in a lowered position. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). As we move our jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly. That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''', which nonhuman primates cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = P. | last2 = Crelin | first2 = E. S. | last3 = Klatt | first3 = D. H. | year = 1972 | title = Phonetic ability and related anatomy of the newborn, adult human, Neanderthal man, and the chimpanzee | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 287–307 | doi=10.1525/aa.1972.74.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when not performed particularly accurately, in humans the articulatory gymnastics needed to distinguish these vowels yield consistent, distinctive acoustic results, illustrating the [[Quantum|quantal]] nature of human speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, K. N. 1972. The quantal nature of speech: Evidence from articulatory-acoustic data. In P. B. Denes and E. E. David, Jr. (eds.), ''Human Communication: A unified view.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, pp. 51–66.&lt;/ref&gt; It may not be coincidental that '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''' are the most common vowels in the world's languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Malden: MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lips===
In humans, the lips are important for the production of [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]], in addition to [[vowel]]s. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons. During primate evolution, a shift from nocturnal to diurnal activity in [[tarsier]]s, monkeys and apes (the [[Haplorhini|haplorhines]]) brought with it an increased reliance on vision at the expense of olfaction. As a result, the snout became reduced and the [[rhinarium]] or "wet nose" was lost. The muscles of the face and lips consequently became less constrained, enabling their co-option to serve purposes of facial expression. The lips also became thicker. "Hence", according to one major authority, "the evolution of mobile, muscular lips, so important to human speech, was the exaptive result of the evolution of diurnality and visual communication in the common ancestor of haplorhines".&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. 2012. The anatomical and physiological basis of human speech production: adaptations and exaptations. In M. Tallerman and K. .Gibson (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether our lips have undergone more recent adaptation to the specific requirements of speech.

===Respiratory control===
Compared with nonhuman primates, humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak. While we are speaking, intercostal and interior abdominal muscles are recruited to expand the thorax and draw air into the lungs, and subsequently to control the release of air as the lungs deflate.

===Larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.&lt;ref name="Fitch. WT 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The phonetic potential of nonhuman vocal tracts: comparative cineradiographic observations of vocalizing animals. | journal = Phonetica | volume = 57 | issue = 2–4 | pages = 205–18  | year = 2000  | doi =  10.1159/000028474| pmid = 10992141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several deer species have a permanently lowered larynx, which may be lowered still further by males during their roaring displays.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | last2 = Reby | first2 = D. | title = The descended larynx is not uniquely human. | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 268 | issue = 1477 | pages = 1669–75 |date=Aug 2001 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2001.1704 | pmid = 11506679 | pmc = 1088793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lions, jaguars, cheetahs and domestic cats also do this.&lt;ref name="Weissengruber 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weissengruber | first1 = GE. | last2 = Forstenpointner | first2 = G. | last3 = Peters | first3 = G. | last4 = Kübber-Heiss | first4 = A. | last5 = Fitch | first5 = WT. | title = Hyoid apparatus and pharynx in the lion (Panthera leo), jaguar (Panthera onca), tiger (Panthera tigris), cheetah (Acinonyxjubatus) and domestic cat (Felis silvestris f. catus). | journal = J Anat | volume = 201 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–209 |date=Sep 2002 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00088.x | pmid = 12363272 |pmc = 1570911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, laryngeal descent in nonhumans (according to Philip Lieberman) is not accompanied by descent of the hyoid; hence the tongue remains horizontal in the oral cavity, preventing it from acting as a pharyngeal articulator.&lt;ref name="Lieberman 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieberman|first1=Philip|title=The Evolution of Human Speech: Its Anatomical and Neural Bases|journal=Current Anthropology| volume=48| issue=1| year=2007 |pages=39–66| url=http://www.cog.brown.edu/people/lieberman/pdfFiles/Lieberman%20P.%202007.%20The%20evolution%20of%20human%20speech,%20Its%20anatom.pdf| doi=10.1086/509092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of the larynx, [[anatomical terms of location|anterolateral]] view]]

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs&amp;nbsp;— increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food&amp;nbsp;— we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit&amp;nbsp;— so it is claimed&amp;nbsp;— must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135| pmc = 3338724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech.

At least one [[orangutan]] has demonstrated the ability to control the voice box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orangutan's Vocal Feats Hint At Deeper Roots of Human Speech |author=Jon Hamilton |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/14/518170608/orangutans-vocal-feats-hint-at-deeper-roots-of-human-speech |date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"&amp;nbsp;— giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.''

===Could the Neanderthals speak?===
[[File:Gray186.png|thumb|Hyoid bone&amp;nbsp;— anterior surface, enlarged]]
[[File:Gray1194.png|thumb|Anterolateral view of head and neck]]

Most specialists credit the Neanderthals with speech abilities not radically different from those of modern ''Homo sapiens''. An indirect line of argument is that their tool-making and hunting tactics would have been difficult to learn or execute without some kind of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn &amp; Coolidge, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; A recent extraction of [[DNA]] from Neanderthal bones indicates that Neanderthals had the same version of the [[FOXP2]] gene as modern humans. This gene, once mistakenly described as the "grammar gene", plays a role in controlling the orofacial movements which (in modern humans) are involved in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nicholas |last=Wade |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date=19 October 2007 |title=Neanderthals Had Important Speech Gene, DNA Evidence Shows |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/science/19speech-web.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, it was widely believed that the Neanderthals lacked modern speech capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Philip |last=Lieberman |author2=Edmund S. Crelin |date=Spring 1971 |title=On the Speech of Neanderthal Man |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=203–222 |doi= |doi-broken-date=22 May 2009 |jstor=4177625}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that they possessed a hyoid bone so high up in the vocal tract as to preclude the possibility of producing certain vowel sounds.

The hyoid bone is present in many [[mammal]]s. It allows a wide range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order to produce variation.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the larynx in chimpanzee infants. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100 | issue = 12 | pages = 6930–3 | date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1231107100 | pmid = 12775758 | pmc = 165807}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now realised that its lowered position is not unique to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', while its relevance to vocal flexibility may have been overstated: although men have a lower larynx, they do not produce a wider range of sounds than women or two-year-old babies.

The morphology of the [[outer ear|outer]] and [[middle ear]] of [[Middle Pleistocene]] hominins from [[Atapuerca, Province of Burgos|Atapuerca]] SH in Spain, believed to be proto-Neanderthal, suggests they had an auditory sensitivity similar to modern humans and very different from chimpanzees.

The hypoglossal nerve plays an important role in controlling movements of the tongue. In 1998, one research team used the size of the hypoglossal canal in the base of fossil skulls in an attempt to estimate the relative number of nerve fibres, claiming on this basis that Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neanderthals had more fine-tuned tongue control than either [[australopithecine]]s or apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kay | first1 = R.

==Origin of speech sounds==

===Distinctive features theory===
{{IPA vowels|class=infobox}}
According to one influential school,&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R., Gunnar, C., Fant, M. and Halle, M. 1952. ''Preliminaries to Speech Analysis.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. and M. Halle 1956. ''Fundamentals of Language.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; the human vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital on the model of a keyboard or digital computer. If so, this is remarkable: nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard, notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This poses the question as to when and how, during and the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred.

The human supralaryngeal tract is said to be digital in the sense that it is an arrangement of moveable toggles or switches, each of which, at any one time, must be in one state or another. The vocal cords, for example, are either vibrating (producing a sound) or not vibrating (in silent mode). By virtue of simple physics, the corresponding [[distinctive feature]]&amp;nbsp;— in this case, "voicing"&amp;nbsp;— cannot be somewhere in between. The options are limited to "off" and "on". Equally digital is the feature known as "[[Nasalization|nasalisation]]". At any given moment the [[soft palate]] or velum either allows or doesn't allow sound to resonate in the nasal chamber. In the case of lip and tongue positions, more than two digital states may be allowed. '''(To experiment with this, click on [http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~danhall/phonetics/sammy.html Interactive Saggital Section]).'''

The theory that speech sounds are composite entities constituted by complexes of binary phonetic features was first advanced in 1938 by the Russian linguist [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1938. "Observations sur le classement phonologiques des consonnes", in ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress of Phonetic Sciences,'' Ghent.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent early supporter of this approach was [[Noam Chomsky]], who went on to extend it from phonology to language more generally, in particular to the study of syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1964 [1962]. The logical basis of linguistic theory. In H.G. Lunt (ed.), The Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Linguists. The Hague: Mouton, pp. 914-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. and Halle, M. 1968. ''The Sound Pattern of English.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1965 book, ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax,''&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 148-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky treated semantic concepts as combinations of binary-digital atomic elements explicitly on the model of distinctive features theory. The lexical item "bachelor", on this basis, would be expressed as [+ Human], [+ Male], [- Married].

Supporters of this approach view the vowels and consonants recognised by speakers of a particular language or dialect at a particular time as cultural entities of little scientific interest. From a natural science standpoint, the units which matter are those common to ''Homo sapiens'' by virtue of our biological nature. By combining the atomic elements or "features" with which all humans are innately equipped, anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future. The distinctive features are in this sense atomic components of a universal language.

====Criticism====
In recent years, the notion of an innate "universal grammar" underlying phonological variation has been called into question. The most comprehensive monograph ever written about speech sounds, ''Sounds of the World's Languages,'' by [[Peter Ladefoged]] and [[Ian Maddieson]],&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; found virtually no basis for the postulation of some small number of fixed, discrete, universal phonetic features. Examining 305 languages, for example, they encountered vowels that were positioned basically everywhere along the articulatory and acoustic continuum. Ladefoged concludes that phonological features are not determined by human nature: "Phonological features are best regarded as artifacts that linguists have devised in order to describe linguistic systems."&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. 2006. Features and Parameters for Different Purposes. http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/PLfeaturesParameters.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Self-organization theory===
[[Image:Fugle, ørnsø 073.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Birds flocking, an example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]]]]

[[Self-organization]]  characterizes systems where macroscopic structures are spontaneously formed out of local interactions between the many components of the system.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Oudeyer | first1 = Pierre-Yves | title = Self-organization in the evolution of speech | date = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford University Press; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-928915-8 | oclc = 65203001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In self-organized systems, global organizational properties are not to be found at the local level. In colloquial terms, self-organisation is roughly captured by the idea of "bottom-up" (as opposed to "top-down") organisation. Examples of self-organized systems range from ice crystals to galaxy spirals in the inorganic world, and from spots on the leopard skins to the architecture of termite nests or shape of a flock of starlings.
[[Image:TermiteMound.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A termite mound (Macrotermitinae) in the Okavango Delta just outside [[Maun, Botswana|Maun]], [[Botswana]]]]

According to many phoneticians, the sounds of language arrange and re-arrange themselves through self-organization&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, B., MacNeilage, P. and Studdert-Kennedy, M. 1984. Self-organizing processes and the explanation of language universals. In M. Butterworth, B. Comrie and Ö Dahl (eds), ''Explanations for language universals.'' Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Co., pp. 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2005b. Self-organisation in language. In C. Hemelrijk (ed.), ''Self-organisation and evolution of social systems.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 123–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Speech sounds have both perceptual ("how you hear them") and articulatory ("how you produce them") properties, all with continuous values. Speakers tend to minimise effort, favouring ease of articulation over clarity. Listeners do the opposite, favouring sounds which are easy to distinguish even if difficult to pronounce. Since speakers and listeners are constantly switching roles, the syllable systems actually found in the world's languages turn out to be a compromise between acoustic distinctiveness on the one hand, and articulatory ease on the other.

How, precisely, do systems of vowels, consonants and syllables arise? Agent-based computer models take the perspective of self-organisation at the level of the speech community or population. The two main paradigms here are (1) the iterated learning model and (2) the language game model. Iterated learning focuses on transmission from generation to generation, typically with just one agent in each generation.&lt;ref name="Hurford 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurford, J.

In the language game model, a whole population of agents simultaneously produce, perceive and learn language, inventing novel forms when the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steels | first1 = L | year = 1995 | title = A self-organizing spatial vocabulary | url = | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 319–332 | doi=10.1162/artl.1995.2.319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steels, L. and Vogt, P. 1997. Grounding adaptive language games in robotic agents. In P. Harvey and P. Husbands (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Artificial Life.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 474–482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several models have shown how relatively simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organize a system of sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Berrah A-R., Glotin H., Laboissière R., Bessière P., Boë L-J. 1996. From Form to Formation of Phonetic Structures: An Evolutionary Computing Pers- pective, in Proc. ICML 1996 Workshop on Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning, pp. 23-29, Bari, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as de Boer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Self-organization in vowel systems | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 441–465 | doi=10.1006/jpho.2000.0125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently reformulated using Bayesian theory,&lt;ref&gt;Moulin-Frier C., Laurent R., Bessière P., Schwartz J.-L., and Diard J. 2012 Adverse Conditions Improve Distinguishability of Auditory, Motor and Perceptuo- Motor Theories of Speech Perception: an Exploratory Bayesian Modeling Study. Language and Cognitive Processes, 27(7–8):1240–1263.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how a group of individuals playing imitation games can self-organize repertoires of vowel sounds which share substantial properties with human vowel systems. For example, in de Boer's model, initially vowels are generated randomly, but agents learn from each other as they interact repeatedly over time. Agent A chooses a vowel from its repertoire and produces it, inevitably with some noise. Agent B hears this vowel and chooses the closest equivalent from its own repertoire. To check whether this truly matches the original, B produces the vowel ''it thinks it has heard'', whereupon A refers once again to its own repertoire to find the closest equivalent. If this matches the one it initially selected, the game is successful, otherwise it has failed. "Through repeated interactions," according to de Boer, "vowel systems emerge that are very much like the ones found in human languages."&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2012. Self-organization and language evolution. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), 2012. ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 612-620.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different model, the phonetician [[Björn Lindblom]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom. B. 1986. Phonetic universals in vowel systems. In J. J. Ohala and J. J. Jaeger (eds.), ''Experimental Phonology.'' Orlando: Academic Press, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; was able to predict, on self-organizational grounds, the favoured choices of vowel systems ranging from three to nine vowels on the basis of a principle of optimal perceptual differentiation.

Further models studied the role of self-organization in the origins of phonemic coding and combinatoriality, that is the existence of phonemes and their systematic reuse to build structured syllables. [[Pierre-Yves Oudeyer]] developed models which showed that basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalizations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer P-Y. 2005. The Self-Organization of Speech Sounds, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 233(3), pp. 435–449.&lt;/ref&gt; These models also characterized how morphological and physiological innate constraints can interact with these self-organized mechanisms to account for both the formation of statistical regularities and diversity in vocalization systems.

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that speech was a relatively late development, evolving by degrees from a system that was originally gestural.

Two types of evidence support this theory:
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] minimise vocal signals in favour of manual, facial and other visible gestures in order to express simple concepts and communicative intentions in the wild. Some of these gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David &amp; Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found strong support for the idea that spoken language and signing depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuromotor Mechanisms in Human Communication |author=Kimura, Doreen |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-505492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A. J.|year=2002 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=76–80 |doi=10.1038/nn775 |pmid=11753419 |issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans spontaneously use hand and facial gestures when formulating ideas to be conveyed in speech.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. 1992. ''Hand and mind.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. (ed.) 2000. ''Language and gesture.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also, of course, many [[sign languages]] in existence, commonly associated with [[deaf]] communities; as noted above, these are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.

====Criticism====

Critics note that for mammals in general, sound turns out to be the best medium in which to encode information for transmission over distances at speed. Given the probability that this applied also to early humans, it's hard to see why they should have abandoned this efficient method in favour of more costly and cumbersome systems of visual gesturing&amp;nbsp;— only to return to sound at a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 222 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of explanation, it has been proposed that at a relatively late stage in human evolution, our ancestors' hands became so much in demand for making and using tools that the competing demands of manual gesturing became a hindrance. The transition to spoken language is said to have occurred only at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Corballis, M. C. 2002. Did language evolve from manual gestures? In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 161-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Since humans throughout evolution have been making and using tools, however, most scholars remain unconvinced by this argument. (For a different approach to this puzzle&amp;nbsp;— one setting out from considerations of signal reliability and trust&amp;nbsp;— see "from pantomime to speech" below).

==When did speech evolve?==
{{Human timeline}}
Little is known about the timing of language's emergence in  the human species. Unlike writing, speech leaves no material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern ''Homo'' species had speech ''capacities'', it is still unknown whether they actually spoke. While they may have communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages today, [[Johanna Nichols]]&amp;nbsp;— a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley&amp;nbsp;— argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998. The origin and dispersal of languages: Linguistic evidence. In Nina Jablonski and Leslie C. Aiello, eds., ''The Origin and Diversification of Language,''  pp. 127-70. (Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.) San Francisco: California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently&amp;nbsp;— in 2012&amp;nbsp;— anthropologists Charles Perreault and Sarah Mathew used phonemic diversity to suggest a date consistent with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e35289 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Phonemic diversity" denotes the number of perceptually distinct units of sound&amp;nbsp;— consonants, vowels and tones&amp;nbsp;— in a language. The current worldwide pattern of phonemic diversity potentially contains the statistical signal of the expansion of modern ''Homo sapiens'' out of Africa, beginning around 60-70 thousand years ago. Some scholars argue that phonemic diversity evolves slowly and can be used as a clock to calculate how long the oldest African languages would have to have been around in order to accumulate the number of phonemes they possess today. As human populations left Africa and expanded into the rest of the world, they underwent a series of bottlenecks&amp;nbsp;— points at which only a very small population survived to colonise a new continent or region. Allegedly such population crash led to a corresponding reduction in genetic, phenotypic and phonemic diversity. [[African languages]] today have some of the largest phonemic inventories in the world, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be colonized. For example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], a language of New Guinea, and [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes,&lt;ref&gt;Maddieson, I. 1984. ''Patterns of Sounds.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddieson | first1 = I. | last2 = Precoda | first2 = K. | year = 1990 | title = Updating UPSID | url = | journal = UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 104–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes.
The authors use a natural experiment&amp;nbsp;— the colonization of mainland Southeast Asia on the one hand, the long-isolated [[Andaman Islands]] on the other&amp;nbsp;— to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time. Using this rate, they estimate that the world's languages date back to the [[Middle Stone Age]] in Africa, sometime between 350 thousand and 150 thousand years ago. This corresponds to the speciation event which gave rise to ''Homo sapiens''.

These and similar studies have however been criticized by linguists who argue that they are based on a flawed analogy between genes and phonemes, since phonemes are frequently transferred laterally between languages unlike genes, and on a flawed sampling of the world's languages, since both Oceania and the Americas also contain languages with very high numbers of phonemes, and Africa contains languages with very few. They argue that the actual distribution of phonemic diversity in the world reflects recent language contact and not deep language history - since it is well demonstrated that languages can lose or gain many phonemes over very short periods. In other words, there is no valid linguistic reason to expect genetic founder effects to influence phonemic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hunley, Claire Bowern, and Meghan Healy ("Rejection of a serial founder effects model of genetic and linguistic coevolution", Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 2/1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011 Out of Africa?

==Speculative scenarios==

===Early speculations===
{{quotation|"I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries."|{{Citation|title=''Charles Darwin, 1871.'' The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.}}&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. London: Murray, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:&lt;ref&gt;Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''[[Bow-wow theory|bow-wow]]'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''Pooh-Pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise and so on.
* '''Ding-dong'''. Müller suggested what he called the ''Ding-Dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory saw language emerging out of collective rhythmic labour, the attempt to synchronise muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho''.
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max Müller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by [[Sir Richard Paget, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Paget]].&lt;ref&gt;Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experiments, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong&amp;nbsp;— they occasionally offer peripheral insights&amp;nbsp;— as comically naïve and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J. R. 1964. ''The Tongues of Men and Speech.'' London: Oxford University Press, pp. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. ''Inquiries into the origins of language.'' New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic. They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
From the perspective of modern science, the main obstacle to the evolution of speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is that symbols&amp;nbsp;— arbitrary associations of sounds with corresponding meanings&amp;nbsp;— are unreliable and may well be false.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 227–230 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1993.0061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the saying goes, "words are cheap".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J | year = 1994 | title = Must reliable signals always be costly? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1115–1120 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.

Animal vocal signals are for the most part intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. One can "trust" the signal not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just can't fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable,&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, K. 2012. Have we underestimated great ape vocal capacities? In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 90-95.&lt;/ref&gt; but they remain reliable for the same reason&amp;nbsp;— because they are hard to fake.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986" /&gt; Primate social intelligence is ''Machiavellian''&amp;nbsp;— self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive one another, while at the same time constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R. and A. Whiten (eds) 1988. ''Machiavellian Intelligence. Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, it is precisely primates' resistance to deception that blocks the evolution of their vocal communication systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt;

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favour of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.&lt;ref name="Power 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar feature of language is "displaced reference", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

==== "Kin selection" ====
The "mother tongues" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fitch| first1 = W. T.| title = Kin selection and "mother tongues" : a neglected component in language evolution | editors =  Ulrike Griebel; D Kimbrough Oller | work = Evolution of communication systems : a comparative approach | year = 2004 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-262-15111-5 |oclc = 845673575| pages = 275–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]] suggested that the Darwinian principle of "kin selection"&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964a"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = WD. | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 |date=Jul 1964 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4| PMID = 5875341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964b"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = WD. | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

Fitch suggests that spoken languages were originally "mother tongues". If speech evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable vocal signals&amp;nbsp;— spoken words&amp;nbsp;— to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. Ape mothers also share genes with their offspring, as do all animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with non-kin. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited "mother tongue" networks from relatives to non-relatives remains unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;Tallerman, M. In press.

==== "Reciprocal altruism" ====
Ib Ulbæk&lt;ref name="Ulbæk 1998"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Ulbæk | first1 = Ib | title = The origin of language and cognition|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | pages = 30–43 | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; invokes another standard Darwinian principle&amp;nbsp;— "reciprocal altruism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. 'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.'' In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you.'' Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, early society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

=====Criticism=====
Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom "obligatory reciprocal altruism" could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Knight|first1=Chris| title=Language co-evolved with the rule of law| editors = Angelo Cangelosi; Andrew D M Smith; Kenny Smith | work = The evolution of language : proceedings of the 6th international conference (EVOLANG6) , Rome, Italy, 12–15 April 200 | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey | isbn = 9789812566560 | oclc = 70797781| doi=10.1007/s11299-007-0039-1|url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.&lt;ref&gt;Dessalles, J.-L. 1998.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 130-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Gossip and grooming" ====
Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]], does for group-living humans what manual [[Social grooming|grooming]] does for other primates&amp;nbsp;— it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances. As humans began living in larger and larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans invented "a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming"&amp;nbsp;— ''vocal grooming''.  To keep your allies happy, you now needed only to "groom" them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming (the production of pleasing sounds lacking syntax or combinatorial semantics) then evolved somehow into syntactical speech.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R. I. M. | title = Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780571173969 |oclc = 34546743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of "vocal grooming"&amp;nbsp;— that words are so cheap&amp;nbsp;— would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.&lt;ref name="Power 1998" /&gt; A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming&amp;nbsp;— the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds&amp;nbsp;— to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

====From pantomime to speech====
According to another school of thought, language evolved from [[mimesis]]&amp;nbsp;— the "acting out" of scenarios using vocal and gestural pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, M. 1998. Mimesis and the Executive Suite: missing links in language evolution. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C.

Vocal [[distinctive features]] (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose. It is therefore suggested that the establishment of contractual understandings enabled the decisive transition from mimetic gesture to fully conventionalised, digitally encoded speech.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Knight| first1 =  Chris| title = Ritual/speech coevolution: a solution to the problem of deception| editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 68–91 | url=http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/knight_ritual_speech_coevolution.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Knight | first1 = Chris |  title = Play as precursor of phonology and syntax| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 99–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knight | first1 = C. | year = 2008 | title = "Honest fakes" and language origins | url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/JCS_Knight_CRC.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 15 | issue = 10–11| pages = 236–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a "theory of the origins of language". This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider&amp;nbsp;— namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2010. [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf The origins of symbolic culture.] In Ulrich J. Frey, Charlotte Störmer and Kai P. Willfuhr (eds) 2010. ''Homo Novus&amp;nbsp;— A Human Without Illusions.'' Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, pp. 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognised within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society&amp;nbsp;— one where communications technology has already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for an ape communicating with other apes in the wild. Not even the cleverest ape could make language work under such conditions.

{{quotation|"Lie and alternative, inherent in language, ... pose problems to any society whose structure is founded on language, which is to say all human societies. I have therefore argued that if there are to be words at all it is necessary to establish ''The Word,'' and that The Word is established by the invariance of liturgy."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1979. ''Ecology, Meaning, and Religion.'' Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Advocates of this school of thought point out that words are cheap. As digital hallucinations, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever ape, or even a group of articulate apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalisations that ''do'' carry conviction&amp;nbsp;— those they actually use&amp;nbsp;— are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Speech consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world&amp;nbsp;— they are a theoretical impossibility.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society&amp;nbsp;— namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called "institutional facts") can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Searle | first1 = John R. | title = The construction of social reality | year = 1995 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-02-928045-4 | oclc = 31411549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any [[hunter-gatherer]] society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ''ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1947 [1915].

=====Criticism=====
Critics of the theory include [[Noam Chomsky]], who terms it the "non-existence" hypothesis&amp;nbsp;— a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky (2011): [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 Language and Other Cognitive Systems. What Is Special About Language?], Language Learning and Development, 7:4, 263-278&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 2005 | title = Three factors in language design | url = | journal = Linguistic Inquiry | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1162/0024389052993655}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting his critics in turn to retort that only something that doesn't exist&amp;nbsp;— a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction&amp;nbsp;— could possibly emerge in such a miraculous way.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Twentieth century speculations===

====Festal origins====
The essay "The festal origin of human speech", though published in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan, J. 1891-92. The festal origin of human speech, part I. ''Mind'' '''16'''(64), pp. 495-506.&lt;/ref&gt; made little impact until the American philosopher [[Susanne Langer]] re-discovered and publicised it in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, S. 1957 [1941]. ''Philosophy in a New Key.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"In the early history of articulate sounds they could make no meaning themselves, but they preserved and got intimately associated with the peculiar feelings and perceptions that came most prominently into the minds of the festal players during their excitement."|{{Citation|title=''J. Donovan, 1891.'' The Festal Origin of Human Speech.}}&lt;ref name="Donovan" /&gt;}}
The theory sets out from the observation that primate vocal sounds are above all ''emotionally'' expressive. The emotions aroused are socially contagious. Because of this, an extended bout of screams, hoots or barks will tend to express not just the feelings of this or that individual but the mutually contagious ups and downs of everyone within earshot.

Turning to the ancestors of ''Homo sapiens'', the "festal origin" theory suggests that in the "play-excitement" preceding or following a communal hunt or other group activity, everyone might have combined their voices in a comparable way, emphasising their mood of togetherness with such noises as rhythmic drumming and hand-clapping. Variably pitched voices would have formed conventional patterns, such that choral singing became an integral part of communal celebration.

Although this was not yet speech, according to Langer, it developed the vocal capacities from which speech would later derive. There would be conventional modes of ululating, clapping or dancing appropriate to different festive occasions, each so intimately associated with ''that kind of occasion'' that it would tend to collectively uphold and embody the concept of it. Anyone hearing a snatch of sound from such a song would recall the associated occasion and mood. A melodic, rhythmic sequence of syllables conventionally associated with a certain type of celebration would become, in effect, its vocal mark. On that basis, certain familiar sound sequences would become "symbolic".

In support of all this, Langer cites ethnographic reports of tribal songs consisting entirely of "rhythmic nonsense syllables". She concedes that an English equivalent such as "hey-nonny-nonny", although perhaps suggestive of certain feelings or ideas, is neither noun, verb, adjective, nor any other syntactical part of speech. So long as articulate sound served only in the capacity of "hey nonny-nonny", "hallelujah" or "alack-a-day", it cannot yet have been speech. For that to arise, according to Langer, it was necessary for such sequences to be emitted increasingly ''out of context''&amp;nbsp;— outside the total situation that gave rise to them. Extending a set of associations from one cognitive context to another, completely different one, is the secret of ''metaphor''. Langer invokes an early version of what is nowadays termed "grammaticalisation" theory to show how, from, such a point of departure, syntactically complex speech might progressively have arisen.

Langer acknowledges [[Emile Durkheim]] as having proposed a strikingly similar theory back in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1976 [1912]. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life.''

===="Musilanguage"====
The term "musilanguage" (or "hmmmmm") refers to a pre-linguistic system of vocal communication from which (according to some scholars) ''both'' music ''and'' language later derived. The idea is that rhythmic, melodic, emotionally expressive vocal ritual helped bond coalitions and, over time, set up selection pressures for enhanced volitional control over the speech articulators. Patterns of synchronised choral chanting are imagined to have varied according to the occasion. For example, "we're setting off to find honey" might sound qualitatively different from "we're setting off to hunt" or "we're grieving over our relative's death". If social standing depended on maintaining a regular beat and harmonising one's own voice with that of everyone else, group members would have come under pressure to demonstrate their choral skills.

Archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]] speculates that the Neanderthals possessed some such system, expressing themselves in a "language" known as "Hmmmmm", standing for '''H'''olistic, '''m'''anipulative, '''m'''ulti-'''m'''odal, '''m'''usical and '''m'''imetic.&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;169-175&lt;/sup&gt; In Bruce Richman's earlier version of essentially the same idea,&lt;ref name="Richman 2000" /&gt; frequent repetition of the same few songs by many voices made it easy for people to remember those sequences as whole units. Activities that a group of people were doing while they were vocalising together&amp;nbsp;— activities that were important or striking or richly emotional&amp;nbsp;— came to be associated with particular sound sequences, so that each time a fragment was heard, it evoked highly specific memories. The idea is that the earliest lexical items (words) started out as abbreviated fragments of what were originally communal songs.

{{quotation|"Whenever people sang or chanted a particular sound sequence they would remember the concrete particulars of the situation most strongly associated with it: ah, yes! we sing this during this particular ritual admitting new members to the group; or, we chant this during a long journey in the forest; or, when a clearing is finished for a new camp, this is what we chant; or these are the keenings we sing during ceremonies over dead members of our group."|{{Citation|title=''Richman, B. 2000. How music fixed "nonsense" into significant formulas: on rhythm, repetition, and meaning. In N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown (eds), ''The Origins of Music: An introduction to evolutionary musicology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 301-314.}}}}

As group members accumulated an expanding repertoire of songs for different occasions, interpersonal call-and-response patterns evolved along one trajectory to assume linguistic form. Meanwhile, along a divergent trajectory, polyphonic singing and other kinds of music became increasingly specialised and sophisticated.

To explain the establishment of syntactical speech, Richman cites English "I wanna go home". He imagines this to have been learned in the first instance not as a combinatorial sequence of free-standing words, but as a single stuck-together combination&amp;nbsp;— the melodic sound people make to express "feeling homesick". Someone might sing "I wanna go home", prompting other voices to chime in with "I need to go home", "I'd love to go home", "Let's go home" and so forth. Note that one part of the song remains constant, while another is permitted to vary. If this theory is accepted, syntactically complex speech began evolving as each chanted mantra allowed for variation at a certain point, allowing for the insertion of an element from some other song. For example, while mourning during a funeral rite, someone might want to recall a memory of collecting honey with the deceased, signalling this at an appropriate moment with a fragment of the "we're collecting honey" song.  Imagine that such practices became common. Meaning-laden utterances would now have become subject to a distinctively linguistic creative principle&amp;nbsp;— that of recursive embedding.

====Hunter-gatherer egalitarianism====
[[File:Mbendjele meat sharing.jpg|thumb|Mbendjele hunter-gatherer meat sharing]]
Many scholars associate the evolutionary emergence of speech with profound social, sexual, political and cultural developments. One view is that primate-style dominance needed to give way to a more cooperative and egalitarian lifestyle of the kind characteristic of modern hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193"&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. and C. Power (2011). Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 346-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

=====Intersubjectivity=====
According to [[Michael Tomasello]], the key cognitive capacity distinguishing ''Homo sapiens'' from our ape cousins is "[[intersubjectivity]]". This entails [[turn-taking]] and role-reversal: your partner strives to read your mind, you simultaneously strive to read theirs, and each of you makes a conscious effort to assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.

Tomasello argues that this kind of bi-directional cognition is central to the very possibility of linguistic communication. Drawing on his research with both children and chimpanzees, he reports that human infants, from one year old onwards, begin viewing their own mind as if from the standpoint of others. He describes this as a cognitive revolution. Chimpanzees, as they grow up, never undergo such a revolution. The explanation, according to Tomasello, is that their evolved psychology is adapted to a deeply competitive way of life. Wild-living chimpanzees form despotic social hierarchies, most interactions involving calculations of dominance and submission. An adult chimp will strive to outwit its rivals by guessing at their intentions while blocking them from reciprocating. Since bi-directional intersubjective communication is impossible under such conditions, the cognitive capacities necessary for language don't evolve.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999"&gt;Tomasello, M. 1999. ''The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 2006, Why don't apes point? In N. J. Enfield &amp; S. C. Levinson (eds), ''Roots of Human Sociality: Culture, cognition and interaction.'' Oxford &amp; New York: Berg, pp. 506-524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008"&gt;Tomasello, M. 2008. ''Origins of Human Communication.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Counter-dominance=====
In the scenario favoured by David Erdal and Andrew Whiten,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erdal | first1 = D. | last2 = Whiten | first2 = A. | year = 1994 | title = On human egalitarianism: an evolutionary product of Machiavellian status escalation? | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 175–183 | doi=10.1086/204255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, D. and A. Whiten 1996. Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution. In P. Mellars and K. Gibson (eds), ''Modelling the Early Human Mind.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute Monographs, pp. 139-150.&lt;/ref&gt; primate-style dominance provoked equal and opposite coalitionary resistance&amp;nbsp;— ''counter-dominance.'' During the course of human evolution, increasingly effective strategies of rebellion against dominant individuals led to a compromise. While abandoning any attempt to dominate others, group members vigorously asserted their personal autonomy, maintaining their alliances to make potentially dominant individuals think twice. Within increasingly stable coalitions, according to this perspective, status began to be earned in novel ways, social rewards accruing to those perceived by their peers as especially cooperative and self-aware.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193" /&gt;

=====Reverse dominance=====
While counter-dominance, according to this evolutionary narrative, culminates in a stalemate, anthropologist Christopher Boehm&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 1997. Egalitarian behaviour and the evolution of political intelligence. In A. Whiten and R. W. Byrne (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and evaluations.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 341-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extends the logic a step further. Counter-dominance tips over at last into full-scale "reverse dominance". The rebellious coalition decisively overthrows the figure of the primate alpha-male. No dominance is allowed except that of the self-organised community as a whole.

As a result of this social and political change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As children grow up, they are motivated by those around them to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds on the model of their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition. It is in this social and political context that language evolves.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

====Scenarios involving mother-infant interactions====

====="Putting the baby down"=====
According to Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory, vocal interactions between early hominin mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falk | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early Hominins: Whence motherese? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 491–503 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their monkey and ape counterparts, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed reassurance that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.

;Criticism
While this theory may explain a certain kind of infant-directed "protolanguage"&amp;nbsp;— known today as "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— it does little to solve the really difficult problem, which is the emergence among adults of syntactical speech. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=====Co-operative breeding=====
Evolutionary anthropologist Sarah Hrdy&lt;ref name="Hrdy 2009"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hrdy | first1 = Sarah Blaffer | title = Mothers and others : the evolutionary origins of mutual understanding | year = 2009 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-03299-6 | oclc = 261174072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that only human mothers among great apes are willing to let another individual take hold of their own babies; further, we are routinely willing to let others babysit. She identifies lack of trust as the major factor preventing chimp, bonobo or gorilla mothers from doing the same: "If ape mothers insist on carrying their babies everywhere&amp;nbsp;... it is because the available alternatives are not safe enough." The fundamental problem is that ape mothers (unlike monkey mothers who may often babysit) do not have female relatives nearby. The strong implication is that, in the course of ''Homo'' evolution, allocare could develop because ''Homo'' mothers did have female kin close by&amp;nbsp;— in the first place, most reliably, their own mothers. Extending the [[Grandmother hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Hawkes 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = K. | last2 = O'Connell | first2 = JF. | last3 = Jones | first3 = NG. | last4 = Alvarez | first4 = H. | last5 = Charnov | first5 = EL. | title = Grandmothering, menopause, and the evolution of human life histories. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336–9 |date=Feb 1998 | pmc = 18762 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/95/3/1336.full | PMID = 9448332 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.1336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hrdy argues that evolving ''[[Homo erectus]]'' females necessarily relied on female kin initially; this novel situation in ape evolution of mother, infant and mother's mother as allocarer provided the evolutionary ground for the emergence of intersubjectivity. She relates this onset of "cooperative breeding in an ape" to shifts in life history and slower child development, linked to the change in brain and body size from the 2 million year mark.

Primatologist Klaus Zuberbühler&lt;ref&gt;Zuberbühler, K. 2012. Cooperative breeding and the evolution of vocal flexibility. In Tallerman, M. and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Human Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 71-81.&lt;/ref&gt; uses these ideas to help explain the emergence of vocal flexibility in the human species. Co-operative breeding would have compelled infants to struggle actively to gain the attention of caregivers, not all of whom would have been directly related. A basic primate repertoire of vocal signals may have been insufficient for this social challenge. Natural selection, according to this view, would have favoured babies with advanced vocal skills, beginning with babbling (which triggers positive responses in care-givers) and paving the way for the elaborate and unique speech abilities of modern humans.

=====Was "mama" the first word?=====
These ideas might be linked to those of the renowned structural linguist Roman Jakobson, who claimed that "the sucking activities of the child are accompanied by a slight nasal murmur, the only phonation to be produced when the lips are pressed to the mother's breast&amp;nbsp;... and the mouth is full".&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1960. "Why 'Mama' and 'Papa'". In B. Caplan and S. Wagner (eds), ''Essays in Honor of Heinz Werner.'' New York: International Universities Press, pp. 124-134; p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that later in the infant's development, "this phonatory reaction to nursing is reproduced as an anticipatory signal at the mere sight of food and finally as a manifestation of a desire to eat, or more generally, as an expression of discontent and impatient longing for missing food or absent nurser, and any ungranted wish." So, the action of opening and shutting the mouth, combined with the production of a nasal sound when the lips are closed, yielded the sound sequence "Mama", which may therefore count as the very first word. Peter MacNeilage sympathetically discusses this theory in his major book, The ''Origin of Speech'', linking it with Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory (see above).&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 144-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, other scholars have suggested completely different candidates for ''Homo sapiens''' very first word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kenneally | first1 = Christine. | title = The first word : the search for the origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Viking | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-670-03490-1 | oclc = 80460757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niche construction theory====
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego. Beavers adapt to an environmental niche which they shape by their own activities.]]While the biological language faculty is genetically inherited, actual languages or dialects are culturally transmitted, as are social norms, technological traditions and so forth. Biologists expect a robust co-evolutionary trajectory linking human genetic evolution with the evolution of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P. J. and R. Boyd, 2004. ''Not by Genes Alone: How culture transformed human evolution.'' Chicago: Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals capable of rudimentary forms of protolanguage would have enjoyed enhanced access to cultural understandings, while these, conveyed in ways that young brains could readily learn, would in turn have become transmitted with increasing efficiency.

In some ways like beavers as they construct their dams, humans have always engaged in [[niche construction]], creating novel environments to which they subsequently become adapted. Selection pressures associated with prior niches tend to become relaxed as humans depend increasingly on novel environments created continuously by their own productive activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laland | first1 = K.

==Conceptual frameworks==

===Structuralism===
{{quotation|"Consider a knight in chess. Is the piece by itself an element of the game? Certainly not. For as a material object, separated from its square on the board and the other conditions of play, it is of no significance for the player. It becomes a real, concrete element only when it takes on or becomes identified with its value in the game. Suppose that during a game this piece gets destroyed or lost. Can it be replaced? Of course it can. Not only by some other knight, but even by an object of quite a different shape, which can be counted as a knight, provided it is assigned the same value as the missing piece."|{{Citation|title=Saussure, F. de 1983 [1916]. ''Course in General Linguistics.'' Translated by R. Harris. London: Duckworth, pp. 108-09.}}}}  The Swiss scholar [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] founded linguistics as a twentieth-century professional discipline. Saussure regarded a language as a rule-governed system, much like a board game such as chess. In order to understand chess, he insisted, we must ignore such external factors as the weather prevailing during a particular session or the material composition of this or that piece. The game is autonomous with respect to its material embodiments. In the same way, when studying language, it's essential to focus on its internal structure as a social institution. External matters (''e.g.'', the shape of the human tongue) are irrelevant from this standpoint. Saussure regarded 'speaking' ''(parole)'' as individual, ancillary and more or less accidental by comparison with "language" ''(langue)'', which he viewed as collective, systematic and essential.

Saussure showed little interest in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Nor did he consider it worthwhile to speculate about how language might originally have evolved. Saussure's assumptions in fact cast doubt on the validity of narrowly conceived origins scenarios. His structuralist paradigm, when accepted in its original form, turns scholarly attention to a wider problem: how our species acquired the capacity to establish [[social institutions]] in general.

===Behaviourism===
{{Main|Behaviourism}}
{{quotation|"The basic processes and relations which give verbal behaviour its special characteristics are now fairly well understood. Much of the experimental work responsible for this advance has been carried out on other species, but the results have proved to be surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behaviour without serious modification."|{{Citation|title=Skinner, B.F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts, p. 3.}}}} In the United States, prior to and immediately following World War II, the dominant psychological paradigm was [[behaviourism]]. Within this conceptual framework, language was seen as a certain kind of behaviour&amp;nbsp;— namely, verbal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; to be studied much like any other kind of behaviour in the animal world. Rather as a laboratory rat learns how to find its way through an artificial maze, so a human child learns the verbal behaviour of the society into which it is born. The phonological, grammatical and other complexities of speech are in this sense "external" phenomena, inscribed into an initially unstructured brain. Language's emergence in ''Homo sapiens,'' from this perspective, presents no special theoretical challenge. Human behaviour, whether verbal or otherwise, illustrates the malleable nature of the mammalian&amp;nbsp;— and especially the human&amp;nbsp;— brain.

===Chomskyan Nativism===
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|left|The [[modularity of mind]] is an idea which was prefigured in some respects by the 19th-century movement of [[phrenology]].]]
{{Main|Jerry Fodor on mental architecture}}{{Main|Cognitive revolution}}Nativism is the theory that humans are born with certain specialised [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitive]] [[modularity|modules]] enabling us to acquire highly complex bodies of knowledge such as the grammar of a language.

That investigation in my view is a complete waste of time, because language is based on an entirely different principle than any animal communication system." |{{Citation|title=Chomsky, N., 1988. ''Language and Problems of Knowledge.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, p. 183.}}}}

From the mid-1950s onwards, [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 1959 | title = Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 26–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1966. ''Cartesian Linguistics. A chapter in the history of rationalist thought.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Fodor]]&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Fodor, 1983. ''The Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and others mounted what they conceptualised as a 'revolution' against behaviourism. Retrospectively, this became labelled 'the [[cognitive revolution]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. 1985. ''The Mind's New Science. A history of the cognitive revolution.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. and C. E. Erneling (eds.), 1997. ''The Future of the Cognitive Revolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas behaviourism had denied the scientific validity of the concept of "mind", Chomsky replied that, in fact, the concept of "body" is more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2002. ''On Nature and Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviourists tended to view the child's brain as a ''tabula rasa'', initially lacking structure or cognitive content. According to B. F. Skinner, for example, richness of behavioural detail (whether verbal or non-verbal) emanated from the environment. Chomsky turned this idea on its head. The linguistic environment encountered by a young child, according to Chomsky's version of [[psychological nativism]], is in fact hopelessly inadequate. No child could possibly acquire the complexities of grammar from such an impoverished source.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1980. ''Rules and Representations.'' New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Far from viewing language as wholly external, Chomsky re-conceptualised it as wholly internal. To explain how a child so rapidly and effortlessly acquires its natal language, he insisted, we must conclude that it comes into the world with the essentials of grammar already pre-installed.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; No other species, according to Chomsky, is genetically equipped with a language faculty&amp;nbsp;— or indeed with anything remotely like one.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000"&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of such a faculty in ''Homo sapiens'', from this standpoint, presents biological science with a major theoretical challenge.

===Speech act theory===
{{Main|Speech act theory}}One way to explain biological complexity is by reference to its inferred function. According to the influential philosopher [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1978 [1955]. ''How to Do Things with Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; speech's primary function is action in the social world.

[[Speech acts]], according to this body of theory, can be analysed on three different levels: locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary. An act is ''locutionary'' when viewed as the production of certain linguistic sounds&amp;nbsp;— for example, practicing correct pronunciation in a foreign language. An act is ''illocutionary'' insofar as it constitutes an intervention in the world as jointly perceived or understood. Promising, marrying, divorcing, declaring, stating, authorising, announcing and so forth are all speech acts in this ''illocutionary'' sense. An act is ''perlocutionary'' when viewed in terms of its direct psychological effect on an audience. Frightening a baby by saying 'Boo!' would be an example of a "perlocutionary" act.

For Austin, "doing things" with words means, first and foremost, deploying ''illocutionary'' force. The secret of this is community participation or collusion. There must be a 'correct' (conventionally agreed) procedure, and all those concerned must accept that it has been properly followed. {{quotation|"One of our examples was, for instance, the utterance 'I do' (take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife), as uttered in the course of a marriage ceremony. Here we should say that in saying these words we are ''doing'' something&amp;nbsp;— namely, marrying, rather than ''reporting'' something, namely ''that'' we are marrying."|{{Citation|title=Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 12-13.}}}} In the case of a priest declaring a couple to be man and wife, his words will have illocutionary force only if he is properly authorised and only if the ceremony is properly conducted, using words deemed appropriate to the occasion. Austin points out that should anyone attempt to baptize a penguin, the act would be null and void. For reasons which have nothing to do with physics, chemistry or biology, baptism is inappropriate to be applied to penguins, irrespective of the verbal formulation used.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This body of theory may have implications for speculative scenarios concerning the origins of speech. "Doing things with words" presupposes shared understandings and agreements pertaining not just to language but to social conduct more generally. Apes might produce sequences of structured sound, influencing one another in that way. To deploy ''illocutionary'' force, however, they would need to have entered a non-physical and non-biological realm&amp;nbsp;— one of shared contractual and other intangibles. This novel cognitive domain consists of what philosophers term "institutional facts"&amp;nbsp;— objective facts whose existence, paradoxically, depends on communal faith or belief.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969" /&gt; Few primatologists, evolutionary psychologists or anthropologists consider that nonhuman primates are capable of the necessary levels of joint attention, sustained commitment or collaboration in pursuit of future goals.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 2006, Why don't apes point?

===Biosemiotics===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]{{Main|Biosemiotics}}

{{quotation|"the deciphering of the genetic code has revealed our possession of a language much older than hieroglyphics, a language as old as life itself, a language that is the most living language of all&amp;nbsp;— even if its letters are invisible and its words are buried in the cells of our bodies."|{{Citation|title=Beadle, G. and M. Beadle, 1966. ''The Language of Life. An introduction to the science of genetics.'' Doubleday and Co, New York.}}}}

Biosemiotics is a relatively new discipline, inspired in large part by the discovery of the genetic code in the early 1960s. Its basic assumption is that ''Homo sapiens'' is not alone in its reliance on codes and signs. Language and symbolic culture must have biological roots, hence [[Semiotics|semiotic]] principles must apply also in the animal world.

The discovery of the molecular structure of DNA apparently contradicted the idea that life could be explained, ultimately, in terms of the fundamental laws of physics. The letters of the genetic alphabet seemed to have "meaning", yet meaning is not a concept which has any place in physics. The natural science community initially solved this difficulty by invoking the concept of "information", treating information as independent of meaning. But a different solution to the puzzle was to recall that the laws of physics in themselves are never sufficient to explain natural phenomena. To explain, say, the unique physical and chemical characteristics of the planets in our solar system, scientists must work out how the laws of physics became constrained by particular sequences of events following the formation of the Sun.

According to Howard Pattee&amp;nbsp;— a pioneering figure in biosemiotics&amp;nbsp;— the same principle applies to the evolution of life on earth, a process in which certain "frozen accidents" or "natural constraints" have from time to time drastically reduced the number of possible evolutionary outcomes. Codes, when they prove to be stable over evolutionary time, are constraints of this kind. The most fundamental such "frozen accident" was the emergence of DNA as a self-replicating molecule, but the history of life on earth has been characterised by a succession of comparably dramatic events, each of which can be conceptualised as the emergence of a new code.&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri, M. 2003. ''The Organic Codes. An Introduction to Semantic Biology.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, the evolutionary emergence of spoken language was one more event of essentially the same kind.&lt;ref&gt;Pattee, H.

===The Handicap principle===
{{Main|Handicap principle}}

[[Image:Peacock front02 - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|A peacock's tail: a classic example of costly signalling]]

In 1975, the Israeli theoretical biologist [[Amotz Zahavi]]&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1975"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = Mate selection-a selection for a handicap. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–14 |date=Sep 1975 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3| pmid = 1195756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1977"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The cost of honesty (further remarks on the handicap principle). | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–5 |date=Aug 1977 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3| pmid = 904334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Zehavi | first1 = Amots. | last2 = Zahavi | first2 = Avishag. | title = The handicap principle : a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle | year = 1997 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-510035-8 | oclc = 35360821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel theory which, although controversial, has come to dominate Darwinian thinking on how signals evolve. Zahavi's "handicap principle" states that to be effective, signals must be reliable; to be reliable, the bodily investment in them must be so high as to make cheating unprofitable.

Paradoxically, if this logic is accepted, signals in nature evolve not to be efficient but, on the contrary, to be elaborate and wasteful of time and energy. A peacock's tail is the classic illustration. Zahavi's theory is that since peahens are on the look-out for male braggarts and cheats, they insist on a display of quality so costly that only a genuinely fit peacock could afford to pay. Needless to say, not all signals in the animal world are quite as elaborate as a peacock's tail. But if Zahavi is correct, all require some bodily investment&amp;nbsp;— an expenditure of time and energy which "handicaps" the signaller in some way.

Animal vocalisations (according to Zahavi) are reliable because they are faithful reflections of the state of the signaller's body. To switch from an honest to a deceitful call, the animal would have to adopt a different bodily posture. Since every bodily action has its own optimal starting position, changing that position to produce a false message would interfere with the task of carrying out the action really intended. The gains made by cheating would not make up for the losses incurred by assuming an improper posture&amp;nbsp;— and so the phony message turns out to be not worth its price.&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/sup&gt; This may explain, in particular, why ape and monkey vocal signals have evolved to be so strikingly inflexible when compared with the varied speech sounds produced by the human tongue. The apparent inflexibility of chimpanzee vocalisations may strike the human observer as surprising until we realise that being inflexible is necessarily bound up with being perceptibly honest in the sense of "hard-to-fake".

If we accept this theory, the emergence of speech becomes theoretically impossible. Communication of this kind just cannot evolve.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; The problem is that words are cheap. Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance on someone else's tongue&amp;nbsp;— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body&amp;nbsp;— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have found it difficult to explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.

An influential standard textbook is ''Animal Signals,'' by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[David Harper (biologist)|David Harper]].&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signal | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852685-8 | oclc = 54460090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors divide the costs of communication into two components, (1) the investment necessary to ensure transmission of a discernible signal; (2) the investment necessary to guarantee that each signal is reliable and not a fake. The authors point out that although costs in the second category may be relatively low, they are not zero. Even in relatively relaxed, cooperative social contexts&amp;nbsp;— for example, when communication is occurring between genetic kin&amp;nbsp;— some investment must be made to guarantee reliability. In short, the notion of super-efficient communication&amp;nbsp;— eliminating all costs except those necessary for successful transmission&amp;nbsp;— is biologically unrealistic. Yet speech comes precisely into this category.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{Main|Cognitive linguistics}}Cognitive linguistics views linguistic structure as arising continuously out of usage. Speakers are forever discovering new ways to convey meanings by producing sounds, and in some cases these novel strategies become conventionalised. Between phonological structure and semantic structure there is no causal relationship. Instead, each novel pairing of sound and meaning involves an imaginative leap.

In their book, ''Metaphors We Live By,'' [[George Lakoff]] and Mark Johnson helped pioneer this approach, claiming that ''[[metaphor]]'' is what makes human thought special. All language, they argued, is permeated with metaphor, whose use in fact ''constitutes'' distinctively human&amp;nbsp;— that is, distinctively abstract&amp;nbsp;— thought. To conceptualise things which cannot be directly perceived&amp;nbsp;— intangibles such as time, life, reason, mind, society or justice&amp;nbsp;— we have no choice but to set out from more concrete and directly perceptible phenomena such as motion, location, distance, size and so forth. In all cultures across the world, according to Lakoff and Johnson, people resort to such familiar metaphors as ''ideas are locations, thinking is moving'' and ''mind is body''. For example, we might express the idea of "arriving at a crucial point in our argument" by proceeding as if literally travelling from one physical location to the next.

Metaphors, by definition, are not literally true. Strictly speaking, they are fictions&amp;nbsp;— from a pedantic standpoint, even falsehoods. But if we couldn't resort to metaphorical fictions, it's doubtful whether we could even form conceptual representations of such nebulous phenomena as "ideas", thoughts", "minds", and so forth.

The bearing of these ideas on current thinking on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong competitive pressure ''not'' to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might prove to be a fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until our ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt;

===Natural science or social science?===

====Social reality====
{{Main|Social reality}}When people converse with one another, according to the American philosopher [[John Searle]], they're making moves, not in the real world which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of [[illocutionary force]] requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level&amp;nbsp;— that of ''social'' reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of "brute facts"&amp;nbsp;— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief&amp;nbsp;— but of "institutional facts", which "exist" only if you believe in them. Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of "institutional facts". One can distinguish between "brute" facts and "institutional" ones by applying a simple test. Suppose no one believed in the fact&amp;nbsp;— would it still be true? If the answer is "yes", it's "brute". If the answer is "no", it's "institutional".&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;

{{quotation|"Imagine a group of primitive creatures, more or less like ourselves&amp;nbsp;... Now imagine that, acting as a group, they build a barrier, a wall around the place where they live&amp;nbsp;... The wall is designed to keep intruders out and keep members of the group in&amp;nbsp;... Let us suppose that the wall gradually decays. It slowly deteriorates until all that is left is a line of stones. But let us suppose that the inhabitants continue to treat the line of stones as if it could perform the function of the wall. Let us suppose that, as a matter of fact, they treat the line of stones just as if they understood that it was not to be crossed&amp;nbsp;... This shift is the decisive move in the creation of institutional reality. It is nothing less than the decisive move in the creation of what we think of as distinctive in human, as opposed to animal, societies."|{{Citation| title = ''John R. Searle, 1995.'' The construction of social reality, ''Free Press, pp.134''}}&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;}}

The facts of language in general and of speech in particular are, from this perspective, "institutional" rather than "brute". The semantic meaning of a word, for example, is whatever its users imagine it to be. To "do things with words" is to operate in a virtual world which seems real because we share it in common. In this incorporeal world, the laws of physics, chemistry and biology do not apply. That explains why illocutionary force can be deployed without exerting muscular effort. Apes and monkeys inhabit the "brute" world. To make an impact, they must scream, bark, threaten, seduce or in other ways invest bodily effort. If they were invited to play chess, they would be unable to resist throwing their pieces at one another. Speech is not like that. A few movements of the tongue, under appropriate conditions, can be sufficient to open parliament, annul a marriage, confer a knighthood or declare war.&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969"&gt;Searle, J. 1969. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t3_WhfknvF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Speech Acts. An essay in the Philosophy of Language].'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain, on a Darwinian basis, how such apparent magic first began to work, we must ask how, when and why ''Homo sapiens'' succeeded in establishing the wider domain of institutional facts.

====Nature or society?====
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
"[[Brute fact#Searle|Brute facts]]", in the terminology of speech act philosopher [[John Searle]],&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt; are facts which are true anyway, regardless of human belief. Suppose you don't believe in gravity: jump over a cliff and you'll still fall. [[Natural science]] is the study of facts of this kind. "Institutional facts" are fictions accorded factual status within human [[social institutions]]. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations. Take my confidence that these two five-pound banknotes in my pocket are worth ten pounds. That's not merely my subjective belief: it's an objective, indisputable fact. But now imagine a collapse of public confidence in the currency system. Suddenly, the realities in my pocket dissolve.

Scholars who doubt the scientific validity of the notion of "institutional facts" include [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom language is not social. In Chomsky's view, language is a natural object (a component of the individual brain) and its study, therefore, a branch of natural science. In explaining the origin of language, scholars in this intellectual camp invoke non-social developments&amp;nbsp;— in Chomsky's case, a random genetic mutation.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000" /&gt; Chomsky argues that language might exist inside the brain of a single mutant gorilla even if no one else believed in it, even if no one else existed apart from the mutant&amp;nbsp;— and even if the gorilla in question remained unaware of its existence, never actually speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 17-18..&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite philosophical camp are those who, in the tradition of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], argue that if no one believed in words or rules, they simply would not exist. These scholars, correspondingly, regard language as essentially institutional, concluding that linguistics should be considered a topic within [[social science]]. In explaining the evolutionary emergence of language, scholars in this intellectual camp tend to invoke profound changes in social relationships.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dessalles 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dessalles | first1 = Jean-Louis. | title = Why we talk : the evolutionary origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-927623-3 | oclc = 71329834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism.''' Darwinian scientists today see little value in the traditional distinction between "natural" and "social" science.

'''Pandemonia''' is a character and persona created as [[conceptual art]] by an anonymous London-based artist that has appeared in the art and fashion world since 2009.&lt;ref name="Stylist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Pandemonia|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/londonfashionweek/meet-pandemonia |work=[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]] |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clad in a latex full-head mask with stylized hair and latex dresses,&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt; Pandemonia is seven feet tall and was described by Katia Ganfield of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' as "[[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s blonde caricatures ... brought to life as a 7 ft [[Jeff Koons]] inflatable".&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandemonia|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/pandemonia-roy-lichtenstein-inflatable-seven-foot-tall- |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |first=Katia |last=Ganfield |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often accompanied by an inflatable white dog named Snowy.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;

Pandemonia told ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'':
{{Quote|Back in 2008 the newspapers were full of celebrities. I was drawn towards creating art that documented our time. It seemed evident to me that the best way to parody this world would be to create my very own celebrity. I created a truly artificial one, in the spirit of consumerist values. Slim, tall, glossy, forever young and, of course, famous.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;}}

Initially a "[[gate crashing|crasher]]" at fashion and social events, Pandemonia eventually became a [[London Fashion Week]] VIP guest.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;

Pandemonia is a critical reflection and, as such, an intervention upon ideas of celebrity and femininity.  She is a pointed manifestation of how these ideas intersect with mass media, social media, and the marketability of desire. The art of Pandemonia herself is that of a constructed figure placed in the landscape of media, fashion and art events that has instigated the media response by feeding back to the media its own language, imagery and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus On: Pandemonia (Interview) |url=http://www.vogue.it/people-are-talking-about/focus-on/2012/03/pandemonia |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Italia]] |date=12 March 2012 |first=Susanna |last=Cappellaro |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=When I pop up in celebrity circles I can see the mechanism of fame from both the inside and outside. Just as celebrities presented their image to the public, I present the celebrities my image. At least I know I'm acting out celebrity. My dog, Snowy, breaks the ice. People relate to him. Funny how people relate to an inflatable dog, isn't it?|author=Pandemonia |source=&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;}}

The growth of Pandemonia's celebrity is one of the themes in her art, which also explores archetypes of pop myth and reality.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

Pandemonia’s art is not only cross-media (sculpture, digital art, photography, and performance), but also cross-generational as she ties the earliest moments of [[Pop Art]] to the most current worlds of celebrity, fashion and contemporary art, creating an arc and evolution which continues its ongoing exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oddamagazine.com/|title=ODDA Magazine Home Page|website=oddamagazine.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pandemonia was chosen by [[Camper (company)|Camper]] as the protagonist and muse for its Kobarah shoe style, and has been featured in stores and billboards in several major cities including Paris, London, New York, and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camper Celebrates Kobarah Shoe During Milan’s Salone Del Mobile|url=http://footwearnews.com/2016/fashion/designers/camper-kobarah-shoe-event-milan-salone-del-mobile-211601/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conference organised by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], in June 2013 adopted a special treaty called "A Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities" (briefly [[Marrakesh VIP Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/vip_dc/vip_dc_8_rev.pdf|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic Conference to Conclude a Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities|url=http://www.wipo.int/dc2013/en/|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Marrakesh Treaty represents an important change in how law makers balance the demands of copyright owners against the interests of people with disabilities in particular, and a potential point of inflection in global copyright politics more generally.

The '''quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns''' ({{lang-fr|querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}}) began overtly as a [[literature|literary]] and artistic debate that heated up in the early 17th century and shook the [[Académie française]].

==Origins of the debate==
It was an essential feature of the European Renaissance to praise recent discoveries and achievements as a means to assert the independence of modern culture from the institutions and wisdom inherited from Classical (Greek and Roman) authorities. From the first years of the sixteenth century, one of the major reasonings used to this end by the most eminent [[Humanism|humanists]] ([[François Rabelais]], [[Girolamo Cardano]], [[Jean Bodin]], [[Louis LeRoy]], [[Tommaso Campanella]], [[Francis Bacon]], etc.) was that of the "Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times" – the printing press, firearms, and the nautical compass – which together allowed the Moderns to communicate, exert power, and travel at distances never imagined by the Ancients.&lt;ref&gt;Boruchoff, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When the quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns later arose in France, the "Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times" would almost invariably be adduced as evidence of the Moderns' superiority.

The debate became known as 'a quarrel' after the frequently made [[pun]] on [[Charles Perrault]]'s title ''Parallel of the Ancients and the Moderns'', the French word 'querelle' being substituted for 'parallele'.

==Debate in France==
On one side of the debate were the Ancients (''Anciens''), led by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]. The Ancients supported the merits of the ancient authors, and contended that a writer could do no better than imitate them. On the other side were the Moderns (''Modernes''), who opened fire first with [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s ''Le siècle de Louis le Grand'' ("The Century of Louis the Great," 1687), in which he supported the merits of the authors of the century of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and expressed the Moderns' stance in a nutshell:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
::''La docte Antiquité dans toute sa durée
::''A l'égal de nos jours ne fut point éclairée.''
{{col-break}}
Learned [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], through all its extent, &lt;br /&gt;Was never [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] to equal our times.&lt;ref&gt;Perrault's poem was published in 1687 in [[François de Callières]]'s ''Histoire poetique de la guerre nouvellement declarée entre les anciens et les modernes'' ("Poetic history of the war recently declared between the ancients and the moderns"),  which was not itself strictly partisan of one side or the other..&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

[[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] quickly followed with his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'' (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.

In the opening years of the next century, [[Marivaux]] was to show himself a Modern by establishing a new genre of theatre, unknown to the Ancients, the sentimental comedy (''[[comédie larmoyante]]''). In it the impending tragedy was resolved at the end, amid reconciliations and floods of tears. By constraining his choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], [[Jean Racine]] showed himself one of the Ancients. He also restricted his tragedies by the [[classical unities]], derived by the [[classicism|classicists]] from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': the unities of place, time, and action (one scene location, 24 hours, and consistent actions respectively).

==Assessment==
The Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns was a cover, often a witty one, for deeper opposed views. The very idea of Progress was under attack on the one side, and [[Authority]] on the other.  The new [[Antiquary|antiquarian interests]] led to critical reassessment of the products of Antiquity that would eventually bring Scripture itself under the magnifying glass of some Moderns.  The attack on authority in literary criticism had analogues in the rise of scientific inquiry, and the Moderns' challenge to authority in literature foreshadowed a later extension of challenging inquiry in systems of politics and religion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Analogous 17th–20th century debates==
In the 17th century, [[William Temple (British politician)|Sir William Temple]] argued against the Modern position in his essay ''On Ancient and Modern Learning''; therein he repeated the [[literary topos|commonplace]], originally from [[Bernard of Chartres]], that we see more only because we are dwarves [[standing on the shoulders of giants]].   Temple's essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were classicist and editor [[Richard Bentley]] and critic [[William Wotton]].

The entire discussion in England was over by 1696, but it was revisited by [[Jonathan Swift]], who saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general orientations or ways of life. He articulated his discussion most notably in his [[satire]] ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'', composed between 1694 and 1697 and published in 1704 with the famous prolegomenon ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'', long after the initial salvoes were over in France. Swift's polarizing satire provided a framework for other satirists in his circle of the [[Scriblerus Club|Scriblerian]]s.

Two other distinguished 18th-century philosophers who wrote at length concerning the distinction between moderns and ancients are [[Giambattista Vico]] (cf. e.g. his ''[[De nostri temporis studiorum ratione]]'') and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (for whom the moderns see 'more,' but the ancients see 'better').

In 19th-century England, highlighting the distinction between Hellenism ("Athens"/reason or "sweetness and light") and Hebraism ("Jerusalem"/faith), [[Matthew Arnold]] defended the ancients (most notably Plato and Aristotle) against the dominant progressive intellectual trends of his times.  Arnold drew attention to the fact that the great divide between ancients and modernists pertained to the understanding of the relation between liberty/reason and authority.

Countering the thrust of much of 20th-century intellectual history and literary criticism, [[Leo Strauss]] has contended that the debate between ancients and moderns (or the defenders of either camp) is ill understood when reduced to questions of progress or regress.  Strauss himself revived the old "querelle," siding with the ancients (against the modernist position advocated, e.g., by Strauss's friend [[Alexandre Kojève]]).{{cn|date=April 2015}}

United States society is  considered by some a racialized society in which divisions between the racial/ethnic groups are given. [[Critical race theory]] argues that [[racism]] is normal and is engrained [sic] in the fabric and system of the [[American society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacrs.wordpress.com/what-is-critical-race-theory/ |title=What is critical race theory? |accessdate=11 March 2012 |publisher= Critical Race Studies, [[UCLA School of Public Affairs]] (via WordPress) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ladson-Billings | first = Gloria | title = Just what is critical race theory and what's it doing in a nice field like education? | journal = International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–24 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/095183998236863 | date = January 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095183998236863 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are ongoing racial disparities between races in the United States in employment, housing, religion, and [[race-conscious]] institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Gregory J. | last2 = St. John | first2 = Jeffrey | last3 = Striphas | first3 = Ted | title = Communication as ...:perspectives on theory | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412906586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue a "privileged/non-privileged dynamic" exists. This means that [[cultural practice]] assigns value and assumed competence to people who have certain characteristics or features. The social psychological approach maintains that prejudice socialized early in life feeds racial stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Sears &gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sears | first1 = David O. | last2 = Sidanius | first2 = Jim | last3 = Bobo | first3 = Lawrence D. | author-link1 = David O.

It is often said that social interaction is infused with a privileged / non-privileged dynamic which is defined by racial identity — is very complex issue. Racialization hurts both the [[Reverse racism|privileged]] and the non-privileged, but hurts the non-privileged most.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

Until the 1960s there was legal racial [[discrimination in the United States]]. The end of legal discrimination produced major improvements, but scarcely was successful in wiping the slate clean of the many legacies of more than three centuries of formalized state supported inequality. Even after the era of official social discrimination and segregation the lingering residual practices kept [[African American]]s in lower-caste status. Racial problems were viewed as the nation's "most important problem" and many observers felt the United States was in a state of racial crisis. Racially related issues, such as welfare, crime, segregation, "permissive judges", affirmative action, group based rights, difference-blind treatment, and government regulation and state neutrality with respect to group, have been the subject of strenuous political debate and legislation in the past three decades. 
Significant gaps between blacks and whites in most domains that measure the quality of life continue to exist. Effective standards designed to eliminate discrimination, often described as [[race-conscious]] remedies, have been intensely debated. Supporters argue that [[institutional racism]] is so deeply and subtly embedded in the fabric of American society that little would change if more proactive methods of eliminating discrimination had been used.&lt;ref name=Sears /&gt;

In addition to ''sanankuya'' relationships that are pre-established between certain ethnic or professional clans, a ''sanankuya'' relationship can also be established between any two willing participants who have "broken the ice".  Those in a ''sanankuya'' relationship may treat one another as if cousins or close family members with whom familiar jokes or humorous insults are exchanged. It is considered an essential element of Mande/West African society/and was reputedly ordained as a civic duty in the ''[[Kurukan Fuga]]'', the oral Constitution of the [[Mali Empire]], by [[Sundiata Keita]] in c. 1236.  

The effects of the complex and longstanding custom on West African society may also be seen surviving in [[African-American culture]] in such cultural institutions as "[[the Dozens]]", as well as the custom of non-blood relatives according each other the status of familial relationships ("play" aunts, cousins, etc.).

For an example, the [[Traoré]] and Koné clans each maintain a ''sanankuya'' relationship with the others' members, and one of the biggest running jokes is that each clan will accuse the other of loving to eat beans the most.&lt;ref&gt;McNaughton, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schleberoda''' is a village and a former municipality in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district, in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. Since 1 July 2009, it is part of the town [[Freyburg, Germany|Freyburg]].

It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Schleberoda is located north of the [[Unstrut]]. It was founded as a result of intensive land development by clearance in the [[High Middle Ages]] such as other villages with ″root″ (Roda) in the name (e.g. Albersroda, Baumersorda, Schnellroda, Ebersroda and Schleberoda).    
The closely bordering local nobles in the area separated their territories using stone landmarks, as is still visible at the historic edges of the nearby woods, authentic landmarks which have been unchanged since the High Middle Ages: The clearance work and founding of new villages ran southwards from the original parish of Mücheln and ended at the Neue Göhle forest, which belonged to the territory of the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgraves of Thuringia]] and could therefore not be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linien und Säume, Zonen und Räume an der Ostgrenze des Reiches im frühen und hohen Mittelalter.|trans-title=Lines and frontiers, zones and spaces at the Eastern border of the empire of the Early and High Medieval Ages|pages=39–56|author=Hardt, Matthias|publisher=Wien|date=2000|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The forest Neue Göhle (Old Sorbian name gola = heath forest) has survived as a continuous, large forest complex. It was used for the production of pole wood in the context of [[winegrowing]] at a very early point in time, which is why it had been afforested in the form of coppice-with-standards.  Stone landmarks, ditches, banks and paths are still visible at the historic edges of this woods separated the territories of the closely bordering local nobles in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg.

== Today ==
Schleberoda has retained the structures and authentic form dating from the time of its foundation. It is an examples of the land development in the contact area between [[Germans]] and [[Slavs]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. It has been able to retain its original ground plan as a radial round village dating from the High Middle Ages.  Around the original village [[pond]], serving for fire-fighting, and the bake house, replaced at the end of the [[18th century]], forward-gabled and side-gabled buildings are grouped, some made with packed loam, with high-quality portals dating from the [[16th century|16th]] to [[19th century]]. 
The position of the former gate to the compact village settlement is still identifiable today. Including the outer boundary of the official village area is not only identifiable by a circumferential path and has survived in its original form to the north-west in the shape of an impenetrable hedge. The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower of the village church with coupled abat sons has survived.

==The common thread==
A common thread can indeed be discerned in the state of science in many NICs. Thus although, most of the science establishments in the major NICs can be said to be doing fairly well, none of them have been as successful as the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may102004/1195.pdf|title=1195.pdf - may102004 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], a small technical elite arose in developing countries such as India, [[Pakistan]], [[Brazil]], and [[Iraq]] who had been educated as scientists in the industrialized world. They spearheaded the development of science in these countries, presuming that by pushing for [[Manhattan project]]-type enterprises in [[nuclear power]], [[electronics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], or [[space exploration]] they could leapfrog the dismally low level of development of science establishments in their countries. India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost hundreds of millions of dollars but had limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/third_world_nukes.html|title=Nuclear Power in the Third World: An Analysis|website=Ccnr.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying [[nuclear weapons]] and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, [[Chandrayaan I]] (''[[Sanskrit]]'' चंद्रयान-1), which literally means "Moon Craft," is an unmanned lunar mission by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; [[Chang'e I]], China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their terminal education from some institution or university in US or Europe. In addition there have been hardly any [[Nobel laureate]]s in science who have conducted the path-breaking research in a native science establishment.

==Science in Brazil==
{{main|Science and technology in Brazil}}
Brazilian science effectively began in the 19th century, until then, Brazil was a poor colony, without universities, printing presses, libraries, museums, etc. This was perhaps a deliberate policy of the Portuguese colonial power, because they feared that the appearance of educated Brazilian classes would boost nationalism and aspirations toward political independence.

The first attempts of having a Brazilian science establishment were made around 1783, with the expedition of Portuguese naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues, who was sent by Portugal's prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, to explore and identify Brazilian fauna, flora and geology. His collections, however, were lost to the French, when [[Napoleon]] invaded, and were transported to Paris by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. In 1772, the first learned society, the Sociedade Scientifica, was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]], but lasted only until 1794. Also, in 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in [[Salvador, Bahia]]. In the second and third decades of the twentieth century, the main universities in Brazil were organised from a set of existing medical, engineering and law schools. The University of Brazil dates from 1927, the [[University of São Paulo]] - today the largest in the Country - dates from 1934.

Today, Brazil has a well-developed organization of science and technology. Basic research in science is largely carried out in public universities and research centers and institutes, and some in private institutions, particularly in non-profit non-governmental organizations. More than 90% of funding for basic research comes from governmental sources.

Applied research, technology and engineering is also largely carried out in the university and research centers system, contrary-wise to more developed countries such as the United States, [[South Korea]], [[Germany]], Japan, etc. A significant trend is emerging lately. Companies such as [[Motorola]], [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]] and IBM have established large R&amp;D&amp;I centers in Brazil. One of the incentive factors for this, besides the relatively lower cost and high sophistication and skills of Brazilian technical manpower, has been the so-called Informatics Law, which exempts from certain taxes up to 5% of the gross revenue of high technology manufacturing companies in the fields of telecommunications, computers, digital electronics, etc. The Law has attracted annually more than 1,5 billion dollars of investment in Brazilian R&amp;D&amp;I. Multinational companies have also discovered that some products and technologies designed and developed by Brazilians are significantly competitive and are appreciated by other countries, such as automobiles, aircraft, software, fiber optics, electric appliances, and so on.

The challenges Brazilian science faces today are: to expand the system with quality, supporting the installed competence; transfer knowledge from the research sector to industry; embark on government action in strategic areas; enhance the assessment of existing programmes and commence innovative projects in areas of relevance for the Country. Furthermore, scientific dissemination plays a fundamental role in transforming the perception of the public at large of the importance of science in modern life. The government has undertaken to meet these challenges using institutional base and the operation of existing qualified scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |title=Science in Brazil |author=José Galizia Tundisi |publisher=Government of Brazil |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AScience+in+Brazil&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215061136/http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |archivedate=December 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science in China==
{{Main|Science and technology in the People's Republic of China| Science in China}}

A question that has been intriguing many historians studying China is the fact that China did not develop a scientific revolution and Chinese technology fell behind that of Europe. Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|author=Nathan Sivin
|url=http://hps.arts.unsw.edu.au/hps_content/new/sivin_new_sts.htm
|title=Think Ahead
|publisher=university of New South wales \accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century and that we are still far from understanding the scientific revolutions of the West and China in all their political, economic and social ramifications. Some like [[John K. Fairbank]] are of the opinion that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress.

[[Needham Research Institute|Needham]] argued, and most scholars agreed, that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called "science". It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature. More recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have focused more on economic causes. Mark Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] is one well-known example of this line of thought, as well as Kenneth Pomeranz' argument that resources from the New World made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.

Thus, it was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.  Similar grounds have been found for questioning much of the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived mainly from [[Taoist]] philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Even though there are physically verifiable anatomical or histological bases for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, for instance skin conductance measurements show increases at the predicted points.

Today, science and technology establishment in the People's Republic of China is growing rapidly. Even as many Chinese scientists debate what institutional arrangements will be best for Chinese science, reforms of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] continue. The average age of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has dropped by nearly ten years between 1991 and 2003. However, many of them are educated in the United States and other foreign countries.

Chinese university undergraduate and graduate enrollments more than doubled from 1995 to 2005. The universities now have more cited PRC papers than CAS in the Science Citation Index. Some Chinese scientists say CAS is still ahead on overall quality of scientific work but that lead will only last five to ten years.

Several Chinese immigrants to the United States have also been awarded the Nobel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other overseas ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] that have achieved success in sciences include [[Fields Medal]] recipient [[Shing-Tung Yau]] and [[Terence Tao]], and [[Turing Award]] recipient Andrew Yao. [[Tsien Hsue-shen]] was a prominent scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] contributed to the Manhattan Project (some argue she never received the Nobel Prize unlike her colleagues [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]] due to sexism by the selection committee). Others include [[Charles K. Kao]], a pioneer in fiber optics technology, and [[Dr. David Ho]], one of the first scientists to propose that AIDS was caused by a virus, thus subsequently developing combination antiretroviral therapy to combat it. Dr. Ho was named [[TIME]] magazine's 1996 Man of the Year. In 2015, [[Tu Youyou]], a pharmaceutical chemist, became the first native Chinese scientist, born and educated and carried out research exclusively in the People's Republic of China, to receive the Nobel Prize in natural sciences.

The [[Science and technology in ancient India|earliest applications of science in India]] took place in the context of medicine, metallurgy, construction technology (such as ship building, manufacture of cement and paints) and in textile production and dyeing. But in the process of understanding chemical processes, led to some theories about physical processes and the forces of nature that are today studied as specific topics within the fields of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india_resource.tripod.com/physics.htm History of Indian Science and Technology: History of Physics and Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical concepts today were contributed by Indian mathematicians like [[Aryabhata]].

There was really no place for scientists in the Indian caste system. Thus while there were/are castes for the learned [[brahmins]], the warriors [[kshatriyas]], the traders [[vaishyas]] and the menial workers [[shudras]], maybe even the bureaucrats (the kayasths) there was/is hardly any formal place in the social hierarchy for a people who discover new knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul25/articles30.htm|title=articles30.htm - jul25 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or invent new devices based on the recently discovered knowledge, even though scientific temper has always been in India, in the form of logic, reasoning and method of acquiring knowledge. Its therefore no wonder that some Indians quickly learned to value science, especially those belonging to the privileged Brahmin caste during the British colonial rule that lasted over two centuries. Some Indians did succeed to achieve notable success and fame, examples include [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] and [[C. V. Raman]] even though they belonged to different castes. The science communication had begun with publication of a scientific journal, Asiatick Researches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1784as.html|title=1784 - Calcutta - Asiatic Society of Bengal - History of Scholarly Societies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1788. Thereafter, the science communication in India has evolved in many facets. Following this, there has been a continuing development in the formation of scientific institutions and publication of scientific literature. Subsequently, scientific publications also started appearing in Indian languages by the end of eighteenth century. The publication of ancient scientific literature and textbooks at mass scale started in the beginning of nineteenth century. The scientific and technical terms, however, had been a great difficulty for a long time for popular science writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{italic title}}
The '''''Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia''''' (''SJE'' - {{lang-ru|Краткая еврейская энциклопедия}}, Kratkaya Yevreyskaya Entsiklopedia) was published in 11 volumes in [[Jerusalem]] from 1976 to 2005 in [[Russian language|Russian]] by the [[Society for Research on Jewish Communities]] with the support of [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem. The ''SJE'' is the only comprehensive encyclopedia on Judaism published in Russian, and followed an almost 70-year gap following the publication of the "[[Yevreyskaya Entsiklopedia]]" (''Encyclopedia Judaica'') of [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary|Brokhaus and Efron]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1908.
&lt;ref name=JE_EJE&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://eleven.co.il/article/15092 Jewish encyclopedias] in ''Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Although it was originally planned as an abridged translation of the English-language ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'', it became clear as the work progressed that readers raised in the [[Soviet Union]] would not be familiar with the concepts lying at the foundation of the cultural and historical system known as [[Jewish civilization]]. Therefore, these concepts were elaborated on in greater detail in the ''SJE'', and terms were introduced which lacked equivalents in modern Russian. Most personal and geographic names (in [[Israel]]) from the [[Bible]] are given in the accepted [[Hebrew]] form. The conceptual foundation of the ''SJE'' is characterized by a thematic bipolarity: [[Eretz Israel]], and in particular the [[State of Israel]] on the one hand, and [[Russian Jews|Russian (i.e., Soviet) Jewry]] on the other, which nevertheless does not exclude the broad scope of different aspects of the lives and history of Jews in all the other countries of the [[diaspora]].&lt;ref name=JE_EJE/&gt;

A group of editors worked on the ''SJE'' who prepared articles with the participation of invited specialists and also academic consultants, including the well-known Israeli academics and public figures [[Shraga Abramson]], [[Mordechai Altschuler]], [[Shlomo Pines]], [[Hayim Tadmor]], [[Chone Shmeruk]], [[Hayyim Schirmann]], [[Menachem Stern]], [[Yaakov Tsur]], [[Yaakov Landau]], [[Israel Bartal]], and [[Michael Liebman]]. Chairing the editorial board were [[Shmuel Ettinger]] and [[Haim Beinhart]]. Chief editors were [[Yitzhak Oren]] (Nadel), [[Michael Zand]], [[Naftali Prat]], and [[Ari Avner]]. The senior academic editors were [[Peretz Hein]], [[Yosef Glozman]], [[Amnon Ginzai]], and [[Mark Kipnis]]. The managing editors were [[Ella Slivkina]] (vol. 1-10) and [[Marina Gutgarts]].&lt;ref name=JE_EJE/&gt;

In practical terms, the ''SJE'' was no longer "shorter," and aside from the 11 volumes a "[[Jewish calendar]] juxtaposed with a [[Gregorian calendar]] (1948-2048)" was published as a pamphlet along with three supplements. Volume 10 also contains a "thematic bibliographic index" with 2,114 items. There are more than 5,300 vocabulary entries, and the total number of words exceeds six million. Volume 11, the final one, included an alphabetized index of subjects, including geographic and personal names and events with references to the volume and column where they are located. A system of citations indicating links between concepts serves as the only cross-reference in the entire corpus of the encyclopedia.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In 1996, the Society for Research on Jewish Communities undertook a reprinting of the first seven volumes of the ''SJE'', which were printed by the printing and publishing house [[Krasnyj Proletarij]] in Moscow.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In 2005, the ''Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia'' (EJE), {{lang-ru|Электронная еврейская энциклопедия}} (Elektronnaja Evrejskaja Entsiklopedia) was made available on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://eleven.co.il/ Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia] based on ''The Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia'' (Краткая еврейская энциклопедия) published in Jerusalem in 1976-2005. The Society for Research on Jewish Communities in cooperation with The Hebrew University, Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; presenting an expanded and more precise version of the ''SJE''. Work on the ''EJE'' continues today.

{{For|the art medium|social practice (art)}}

'''Social artistry''' is the attempt to address or recognize a particular social issue using art and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; Social artists are people who use creative skills to work with people or organizations in their community to affect change.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://www.jeanhouston.org/Social-Artistry/social-artistry.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; While a traditional artist uses their creative skills to express their take on the world, a social artist puts their skills to use to help promote and improve communities. Thus, the main aim of a social artist is to improve society as a whole and to help other people find their own means of creative expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialartistryinstitute.org/who_we_are.htm Institute of Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artists may address issues such as youth alienation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/creative-youth-camps/ Creative Youth Camps]&lt;/ref&gt; or the breakdown of communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://education.jhu.edu/research/newhorizons/future/articles/social-artistry/index.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, social artists will address these problems by helping people express themselves and find their voice, or by bringing people together and using art to help them to foster an understanding of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wenger-Trayner [http://wenger-trayner.com/resources/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artistry can incorporate several different art forms including [[theatre]], [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]]. 

Findings from 2013 confirm the shift from individual expression to community engagement, or "from autonomous to socially engaged."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingo and Tepper cite several examples:
#contemporary artists "see themselves as educators, social workers, policy actors, and health providers (Lena &amp; Cornfield, 2008; Simonds, 2013; Throsby &amp; Zednik, 2011)
#Nick Rabkin writes "more arts graduates end up in education than in any other occupation" (2013)
#social practice artists "freely blur the lines among object making, performance, political activism, community organizing, environmentalism and investigative journalism, creating a deeply [[participatory art]] that often flourishes outside the gallery and museum system"&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social osmosis''' is the indirect [[infusion]] of [[social knowledge|social]] or [[cultural knowledge]]. Effectively, social content is [[Diffusion|diffused]], and by happenstance authentic experience is displaced by degrees of mediated separation before a subject acquires knowledge of a [[social phenomenon]].

An example of ''social [[osmosis]]'' would be knowing a show exists and possessing detailed information concerning aspects of the show, such as the characters' stage names and the names of the cast, ''without'' actively acquiring this knowledge by watching the show.

[[Mutualism (biology)|Symbiosis (mutualism)]] appears in fiction, especially [[science fiction]], as a plot device. It is distinguished from [[parasitism in fiction]], a similar theme, by the mutual benefit to the organisms involved, whereas the [[parasite]] inflicts harm on its host.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |title=Parasitism and Symbiosis |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/parasitism_and_symbiosis |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=25 July 2018 |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
{{further|Parasitism in fiction|Human possession in science fiction}}

Relationships between species in early [[science fiction]] were often [[parasitism in fiction|imaginatively parasitic]], with the [[parasite]]s draining the [[Élan vital|vital energy]] of their human hosts and taking over their minds, as in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1895 ''[[The Parasite]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], science fiction moved towards more mutualistic relationships, as in [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]]'s 1970 ''By Furies Possessed''; [[Brian Stableford]] argues that White was consciously opposing the [[xenophobia]] of [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1951 ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'' which involved a parasitic relationship close to [[demonic possession]], with a more positive attitude towards aliens.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Stableford notes, however, that [[Octavia Butler]]'s 1984 ''[[Clay's Ark]]'' and other of her works such as ''[[Fledgling (novel)|Fledgling]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez-Taylor |first1=Joy |title=Fledgling, Symbiosis, and the Nature/Culture Divide |journal=Science Fiction Studies |date=November 2017 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=486-505 |doi=10.5621/sciefictstud.44.3.0486}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dan Simmons]]'s 1989 ''Hyperion'' take an ambivalent position, in which the aliens may confer powers such as ''Hyperion'''s ability to regenerate continually—but at a price, in its case an incremental loss of intelligence at each regeneration.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

[[The Force]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe is described by the fictional seer [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] as "an energy field created by all living things". In ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'', [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, inside all living cells, allow characters with enough of these symbionts in their cells to feel and use the Force.&lt;ref name="BrooksEpisodeI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace |last=Brooks |first=Terry |authorlink=Terry Brooks |date=1999 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Douglas Adams]]'s humorous 1978 ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Babel fish (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Babel fish]] lives in its human host's ear, feeding on the energy of its host's brain waves, in return translating any language to the host's benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: Fit the First'' BBC Radio 4 program, broadcast 8 March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Wannarexia is a [[cultural phenomenon]] and has no [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] criteria,&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt; although some wannarexics may be instead diagnosed with [[eating disorder not otherwise specified]] (EDNOS).&lt;ref name=amny&gt;{{cite news|title = Bad fad: Wannarexia|work = [[Associated Press]]|publisher = [[AM New York]]|date = 2007-08-06|pages = 24|author = Bauman, Valerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wannarexia is more commonly, but not always, found in teenage girls who want to be trendy,&lt;ref name=amny /&gt; and is likely caused by a combination of [[culture|cultural]] and [[Mass media|media]] influences.&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt;

Dr. Richard Kreipe states that the distinction between anorexia and wannarexia is that anorexics aren't satisfied by their [[weight loss]], while wannarexics are more likely to derive pleasure from weight loss.&lt;ref name=Newsday&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--wannabe-eating-di0804aug04,0,532415.story?page=2 |title='Wannarexic' girls aspire to be anorexic, eating disordered |accessdate=2007-08-06 | work=Newsday|date=2007-08-04|author=Bauman, Valerie|quote=Most commonly found among teenage girls, wannarexia is a label describing those who claim to have anorexia, or wish they did.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-04-wannarexic_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='Wannarexic' girls yearn for eating disorders | date=2007-08-03 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who actually suffer from the eating disorder anorexia are angry, offended, or frustrated about wannarexia.&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt;
