The '''2009 Arab League summit''' was held in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] on March 30, 2009. The Arab League defied the [[International Criminal Court]] by giving a "warm welcome" to [[Sudanese President]] [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], whom the Court placed a warrant on for war crimes in the [[Darfur genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/29/AR2009032902507.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Brian | last=Murphy | title=Sudan's Leader Arrives in Qatar | date=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] boycotted the summit amid differences with Qatar stemming from the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is behind Egyptian President Mubarak's absence from Arab Summit?|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/29/content_11096352.htm|author=Hu Dandan and Liao Zhenyun|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Arab countries like Saudi Arabia were also hesitant to come to the summit if Iran or Hamas were in attendance (neither of the parties came while the Saudis did).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Incidents==
After [[Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]] speech, [[Libyan]] leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] called [[King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] a liar, accusing him of "bringing the Americans to occupy Iraq" and of being "made by Britain and protected by the US.", while stating: "I am an international leader, the dean of the Arab rulers, the king of kings of Africa and the imam (leader) of Muslims, and my international status does not allow me to descend to a lower level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muammar Gaddafi accuses Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah of lying at Arab summit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/qatar/5079290/Muammar-Gaddafi-accuses-Saudi-Arabias-King-Abdullah-of-lying-at-Arab-summit.html|author=Adel Darwish|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya's Gadhafi storms out of Arab summit|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/libya-s-gadhafi-storms-out-of-arab-summit-344|publisher=[[NDTV]] ([[Associated Press]])|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then invited the King to visit him to solve the issues between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Libya's Kadhafi hurls apologies to Saudi king'' |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090330-libyas-kadhafi-hurls-insults-saudi-king |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hlQa00n2?url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090330-libyas-kadhafi-hurls-insults-saudi-king |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 21, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2011, several thousand protesters forcibly entered the Israeli embassy in [[Giza]], [[Greater Cairo]], after breaking down a recently constructed wall built to protect the compound.&lt;ref name=numprotest /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The return of calm in front of the embassy of Israel in Giza|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-671532|work=CNN iReport|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alabass|first=Bassem|title=Israeli workers in Egypt fly home in fear for safety|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/21049/Business/Economy/Israeli-workers-in-Egypt-fly-home-in-fear-for-own-.aspx|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters later broke into a police station and stole weapons, resulting in police using [[tear gas]] in an attempt to protect themselves. The demonstrators eventually broke through the security wall and entered the offices of the embassy. Six members of the embassy staff, who had been in a "[[safe room]]", were evacuated from the site by Egyptian [[commando]]s, following the personal intervention of United States President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=rescue&gt;{{cite news|last=Hadid|first=Diaa|title=Egypt commandos save 6 Israelis in embassy attack|url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-commandos-save-6-israelis-embassy-attack-190607978.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Dan|title=Israel lauds Obama's role in Cairo crisis|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL5E7KA0UV20110910|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama asks Egypt to protect Israeli embassy|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/obama-asks-egypt-protect-israeli-embassy|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{main|Egypt–Israel relations}}
[[File:Burning the Israeli flag at embassy in Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|On 15 May 2011, Egyptian protesters waved [[Palestinian flag]]s in front of the Israeli embassy in [[Giza]] as they burned a makeshift [[Israeli flag]].]]
During 2011, relations between Israel and Egypt deteriorated after the resignation of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]], reaching their lowest point since peace was established between the nations by the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|1979 Egypt&amp;ndash;Israel Peace Treaty]]. The Israeli-Egyptian border became a region of conflict and instability due to increased militant activity in Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]], and anti-Israeli sentiment was expressed in protests by masses of Egyptians in the streets of Giza.

On 18 August 2011, a squad of militants crossed the border from the Sinai Peninsula into southern Israel, [[2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks|killing eight Israelis]]. The ensuing Israeli counter-terrorist operations in close proximity to the border resulted in the deaths of "at least three" Egyptian soldiers.&lt;ref name=apology&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt says Israel apology of troop deaths is insufficient|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-08-21/world/israel.egypt.tensions_1_israel-and-egypt-egyptian-border-amos-gilad?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers' deaths by Israeli fire{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} ignited protests at the Israeli Embassy in Giza. During a demonstration on 20 August 2011, an Egyptian protester climbed 20-feet up the building's facade to remove the [[Israeli flag]].

The Egyptian [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] considered recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv. Eventually, Israel publicly apologized for the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ehud Barak, Israel Defense Minister, Regrets Deaths Of Egyptian Troops|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/20/ehud-barak-egyptian-soldiers_n_932097.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel Apologizes For Deaths Of Egyptian Troops In Shootout With Militants|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/20/israel-apologizes-for-deaths-egyptian-troops-in-shootout-with-militants/|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=20 August 2011|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt stated that Israel's apology was "insufficient."&lt;ref name=apology /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt deems Israel's apology for policemen deaths 'insufficient'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/egypt-deems-israel-s-apology-for-policemen-deaths-insufficient-1.379797|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Haaretz Daily Newspaper|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The attack ==
{{see also|Timeline of the 2011 Egyptian revolution under Supreme Council of the Armed Forces#September}}
On 9 September 2011, hundreds of Egyptian protesters began gathering outside of the Israeli embassy. Around 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, they began to assault a concrete security perimeter wall with hammers and a [[battering ram]]. Egyptian authorities had erected the wall following intense protests in August.

=== Building infiltration ===
At 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning, several thousand protesters&lt;ref name="numprotest"/&gt; breached the security wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptians protest against military rule|url=http://aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119993150747146.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. they had entered the lobby and proceeded through the rest of the building. The demonstrators ransacked the embassy, located on the 20th and 21st floors of the building, and threw items including documents, some marked "[[confidential]]", from the windows of the building to the crowded street below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Mostafa|title=The storming of Cairo's Israeli embassy: an eyewitness account (part I)|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/1/20856/Egypt/The-storming-of-Cairos-Israeli-embassy-an-eyewitne.aspx|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents were quickly scanned and publicly commented on.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Israel later revealed that the remaining Israeli security staff had been separated from the rioters only by the steel door of a safe room in which they had taken refuge.

In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and various other senior Israeli officials watched the events unfold from a direct feed from the surveillance cameras installed in the embassy.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor estimated that about 3,000 protesters were involved in destroying the security wall.&lt;ref name=alert /&gt; An Israeli diplomat condemned the attack as a "serious violation" of diplomatic behavior.&lt;ref name=envoy&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel pulls envoy after embassy attack|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/09/201191064219436657.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the protesters had infiltrated the embassy, United States Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] received a call from Israeli [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Minister of Defense]] [[Ehud Barak]] asking for help. The United States assisted in assuring the protection of the Israeli embassy personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravid|first=Barak|title=U.S. told Egypt it must rescue Israeli embassy workers or suffer 'consequences,'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-told-egypt-it-must-rescue-israeli-embassy-workers-or-suffer-consequences-sources-say-1.383675|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Haaretz Daily Newspaper|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Netanyahu later emphasized that he "would like to thank the US President Barack Obama for his help" in securing the lives of the Israeli embassy staff.&lt;ref name=envoy /&gt;

=== Rescue of embassy staff and end of the riots===
Six Israeli security staff who were on the premises hid inside a reinforced safe room. Egyptian commando forces entered the embassy building and rescued the six Israeli guards.&lt;ref name=rescue /&gt; All other embassy staff and their family members were escorted to [[Cairo International Airport]]. At 2:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the Israeli ambassador and approximately 85 other Israeli diplomats and their family members arrived at the airport and were flown out of Egypt. Only the deputy Israeli ambassador remained in Egypt, staying at the United States embassy.&lt;ref name=stance /&gt; A senior Egyptian security official stated that the Egyptian commandos had been sent to the embassy after Israeli Ambassador [[Itzhak Levanon]] spoke on the phone with an anonymous member of [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Egypt's ruling military council]], and asked him to arrange the safe evacuation of the embassy staff.&lt;ref name=rescue /&gt;

The demonstration and ransacking of the embassy building continued into the early morning hours as the protesters burned tires and set several police cars on fire. The Egyptian police eventually suppressed the riots and dispersed the thousands of rioters by using tear gas and firing warning shots into the air.&lt;ref name=alert /&gt;

Prime Minister Netanyahu and former [[Mossad]] director [[Efraim Halevy]] praised the actions of American president Obama in helping with the evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wexler|first=Robert|title=Defending Obama’s pro-Israel credentials|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=238954|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following the attack on the embassy, the Egyptian army heightened the state of alert in the country and reinstated martial law, otherwise known as [[State of Emergency]], on a temporary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt Declares Emergency After Attack on Israeli Embassy|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-10/egypt-declares-state-of-emergency-after-israeli-embassy-struck.html|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of Saturday, 10 September, Egypt's ruling military council rejected resignation requests that had been submitted by Egyptian Prime Minister [[Essam Sharaf]] and several Egyptian ministers. Their request was made because of the failure to handle the disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lina|first=Yang|title=Egypt's ruling military council rejects PM's resignation|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-09/10/c_131132013.htm|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day after the attacks on the embassy, a group of reporters were attacked by a crowd of people still lingering near the scene of the riots. A reporter and producer were knocked to the ground and trampled, but managed to get to a vehicle in which they retreated, with protesters throwing stones at them. They were able to flee the area without sustaining any major injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Ivan|title=Angry crowd turns on journalists reporting embassy attack in Egypt|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/09/10/egypt.journalists.targeted/|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=11 September 2011|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests===
In August 2012, an Egyptian court convicted 76 Egyptians who were linked to the attack on the Israeli embassy. 75 of those convicted received suspended one-year sentences, and one Egyptian, Omar Afifi who had fled abroad,&lt;ref name="Jpost convict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=282646 | title=Egypt orders man to jail over Israel embassy attack | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | work=Reuters; The Jerusalem Post | date=August 26, 2012 | accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was tried in absentia was given a five-year prison term. Eight charges were listed by the court, including “an assault against diplomatic missions” and “sabotage.”&lt;ref name="TToI Convict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-76-convicted-for-attack-on-israel-embassy/ | title=Egypt: 76 convicted for last year’s attack on Israeli Embassy | publisher=The Times of Israel | date=August 26, 2012 | accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agenda 21 for culture''' (now also known as '''Culture 21''') is a program for [[cultural governance]] developed in 2002–2004 and organized by [[United Cities and Local Governments]].
 
Part of the program's premise is to add culture as a fourth conceptual pillar of [[sustainable development]] in [[governance]], the historical three pillars of which are environment, social inclusion, and economics.

== History ==

"[[Agenda 21]]" is an agenda for [[sustainable development]] in the [[21st century]], approved by [[United Nations]] members at the Rio [[Earth Summit]] in 1992. The original Agenda 21 did not discuss culture in great depth. It did include a section (Chapter 28) known as "Local Agenda 21" which called for local governments to adopt action plans and to collaborate with international organizations; a deliberative process which itself would "increase household awareness of sustainable development issues".&lt;ref&gt;[[Agenda 21]], "[http://www.un-documents.net/a21-28.htm Chapter 28: Local Authorities' Initiatives in Support of Agenda 21]".&lt;/ref&gt; While the ecological dimension of Local Agenda 21 was paramount at first, cities in the following years have incorporated cultural development into their outlook on sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Oldřich Hájek, Jiří Novosák, &amp; Pavel Bednář, "[https://uottawa.scholarsportal.info/ojs/index.php/clg-cgl/article/view/187 Local Agenda 21 and Culture: Lessons from the Czech Republic]", ''Culture and Local Governance'' 3(2), 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the [[World Bank]] and [[UNESCO]] jointly endorsed the inclusion of culture in the sustainable development strategy.&lt;ref name=DuxburyCullenPascual&gt;Nancy Duxbury, Catherine Cullen, &amp; Jordi Pascual, "Cities, Culture, and Sustainable Development"; in H.K. Anheier, Y.R. Isar &amp; M. Hoelscher, eds., ''Cultural  Policy and Governance in a New  Metropolitan Age''; London: Sage, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ismail Serageldin &amp; Joan Martin-Brown, eds., ''[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/100961468770395932/pdf/multi-page.pdf Culture in Sustainable Development: Investing in cultural and natural endowments: proceedings of the conference sponsored by the World Bank and UNESCO, held at the World Bank, Washington, DC, September 28 and 29, 1998].'' Washington, DC: The World Bank, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, the first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in [[Porto Alegre]], resolved to create guidelines for local cultural policies. A final document was approved on 8 May 2004 in Barcelona, and on 15 September it was submitted to [[UN-HABITAT]] and [[UNESCO]]. In the same year, the world organization [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) was formed to coordinate this Agenda 21 for culture.

By 2010, over 400 governments and organizations had jointed Agenda 21 for culture in some way.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013&gt;Nancy Duxbury &amp; Sharon Jeannotte, "[http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/livros/1097_Global_Cultural_Governance_Policy_Duxbury-Jeannotte_2013.pdf Global Cultural Governance Policy]"; Chapter 21 in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Planning and Culture''; London: Ashgate, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 membership exceeded 500.&lt;ref name=Vlassis2015 /&gt;

== Contents ==

The Agenda 21 for culture has 67 articles, divided into three sections: principles, undertakings, and recommendations. The "Principles" include core values such as [[cultural diversity]] and [[human rights]], as well as perspectives on which actors will implement the agenda. [[Cities]] are envisioned as primary sites for cultural production and governance, as well as places where cultural policy is necessary for harmonious coexistence. [[Culture]] itself is described as an essential part of constructing [[citizenship]] for people of all ages. Participation in culture takes place through channels including [[internet]], [[public space]]s, and work.&lt;ref name=A21C&gt;''Agenda 21 for culture'', adopted 8 May 2004. [http://www.agenda21culture.net/sites/default/files/files/documents/multi/ag21_en.pdf Culture 21], edited 31 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Undertakings" section encourages policies which support cultural development and expand access to culture without prejudice. It specifically mentions books, internet, museums, and tourism as vectors for culture. It calls for decentralized but funded cultural policies; multilateral cooperation between cultural institutions, NGOs, and governments; and popularization of scientific technical culture. It advocates the right of [[freedom of speech]], the [[moral rights]] of authors and artists, and the development of legal systems for historic preservation. The recommendations section addresses local and national governments, regional blocs, and international organizations, offering advice for how each of them can implement this agenda.&lt;ref name=A21C /&gt;

== Organization and initiatives ==

In the UCLG, the Agenda 21 for culture is managed by the Committee on Culture, which is co-chaired by Buenos Aires and the City of Mexico and vice-chaired by Angers, Barcelona, Belo Horizonte, Bilbao, Bogotá, Jeju, Paris and Porto Alegre since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.agenda21culture.net/sites/default/files/files/plan/report_2016_-_eng_def.pdf Report 2016] (Barcelona, 30 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2012 and 2015, the UCLG Committee on Culture was chaired by the [http://www.lillemetropole.fr Lille-Métropole] and co-chaired by Buenos Aires, México DF and Montreal, and the cities of Angers, Barcelona and Milan were Vice-Presidents and three other cities (one from Africa, one from Middle East/Asia and one from Asia/Pacific) to join the Board as Vice-Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;See the report of the 8th meeting of the Committee (Barcelona, September 2012) in [http://www.agenda21culture.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=65&amp;lang=en Circular 62]&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2012, the Committee on culture was chaired by [http://www.bcn.cat/en/ihome.htm Barcelona city council], and [http://international.stockholm.se Stockholm], [https://web.archive.org/web/20091012193738/http://www.mairie-lille.fr/en Lille], [http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar Buenos Aires] and [http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,40491560&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Montreal] councils are its vice presidents.

Other organizations promoting Agenda 21 for culture include UNESCO and the [[Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation]] (AECID).

In 2009–2010, UCLG, with AECID and the Barcelona City Council, created the Fund for Local Cultural Governance, to advance the implementation of the Agenda 21 for culture in African, Mediterranean and Latin American cities.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.citiesalliance.org/node/2279 The UCLG Fund for Local Cultural Governance to Finance Projects in 11 Cities]", [[Cities Alliance]], 13 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009–2013 UNESCO and the AECID developed "Culture for Development Indicators" (CDIS), an "advocacy and policy" toll for assessing cultural development in 22 areas within 7 categories.&lt;ref name=Vlassis2015&gt;Antonios Vlassis, "Culture in the post-2015 development agenda: the anatomy of an international mobilization"; ''Third World Quarterly'' 36(9), 2015; [[DOI: 10.1080/01436597.2015.1052064]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the UCLG Committee on Culture has worked to ensure that culture is explicitly integrated into the development programmes of the United Nations which aim to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. After some awareness-raising actions during the Millennium Development Goals Summit, the UN General Assembly approved the final document of the Summit that mentions culture as an important dimension of development.

UNESCO and UCLG have advocated for inclusion of culture in the 2015 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and have continued to promote this outlook.&lt;ref name=Vlassis2015 /&gt;

== Reports ==

Since 2006, in the framework of its research tasks, the Agenda 21 for culture has published several reports:&lt;ref&gt;See reports: [http://www.agenda21culture.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=58&amp;lang=en here]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and development ==
[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|thumb|The [[Circles of Sustainability]] visualization incorporates culture as a fourth pillar of [[sustainable development]].]]

The Agenda 21 for culture is a tool to enhance the role of culture in urban policies and also a tool to make cultural issues the fourth pillar of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;This issue has been championed by Australian researcher and activist Jon Hawkes ([http://www.fourthpillar.biz www.fourthpillar.biz]) in his book ''The Fourth Pillar of Sustainability. Culture’s Essential Role in Public Planning''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sustainability" in culture refers not only to the preservation of cultural heritage but also to incorporating the sustainable development mentality into everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/30969983/Kangas_A._Duxbury_N._and_De_Beukelaer_C._2017_Introduction_cultural_policies_for_sustainable_development_International_Journal_of_Cultural_Policy_23_2_ Anita Kangas, Nancy Duxbury, &amp; Christiaan De Beukelaer], "Introduction: cultural policies for sustainable development"; ''International Journal of Cultural Policy'' 23(2). "Cultural sustainability tends to be defined in two ways. On one hand, it refers to the sustainability of cultural and artistic practices and patterns, including, for example, identity formation and expression, cultural heritage conservation, and a sense of cultural continuity. On the other hand, cultural sustainability also refers to the role of cultural traits and actions to inform and compose part of the pathways towards more sustainable societies. Culture lies at the core of practices and beliefs that can support or inspire the necessary societal transition to more sustainable living. These narratives, values, and actions contribute to the emergence of a more culturally sensitive understanding of sustainable development and to clarifying the roles of art, culture, and cultural policy in this endeavor."&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive work and activism undertaken by the Agenda 100 for culture led the UCLG Executive Bureau to head the preparation of the policy statement document "Culture: the Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", approved on 17 November 2010 in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders – 3rd UCLG World Congress, held in Mexico City. This document opens a new perspective and points to the relationship between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies.

== Participation ==
[[Quebec]] has endorsed the Agenda 21 for culture model and released a development plan along these lines.&lt;ref name=DuxburyCullenPascual /&gt; [[Montreal]] has ratified the agenda and undertaken various actions including library restoration and the creation of new cultural institutions, including "Design Montréal". An NGO called "Culture Montréal" has formed to promote development of and access to culture. Montreal has been designated a "UNESCO City of design".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Rober Choquet &amp; Marie-Eve Bonneau, "Montreal's local cultural policies: Montréal, cultural metropolis: from a municipal policy to a collective action plan. An article underlining the 5th anniversary of the Agenda 21 for culture"; in Pascual (2009), pp. 29–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moroccan city [[Essaouira]], according to mayor [[Asma Chaabi]], has been incorporating culture into its implementation of Local Agenda 21 since the 1990s. She writes in the five-year review of Agenda 21 for culture that Essaouira has succeeded in its historic preservation goals through cooperation with the national ministry of culture and with UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asma Chaabi]], "The Agenda 21 for culture and Essaouira"; in Pascual (2009), pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basic Income Performance in Bern, Oct 2013.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|On 4 October 2013, Swiss activists from Generation Grundeinkommen organized a performance in Bern in which roughly 8 million coins, one coin representing one person out of Switzerland's population, were dumped on a public square. This was done in celebration of the successful collection of more than 125,000 signatures, forcing the government to hold a [[Swiss referendums, 2016#Basic income referendum|referendum]] on whether or not to incorporate the concept of basic income in the Federal constitution. The measure did not pass, with 76.9% voting against changing the Federal constitution to support basic income.&lt;ref name="Vorlage Nr. 601"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/20160605/det601.html |title = Vorlage Nr. 601 – Vorläufige amtliche Endergebnisse |author =  |date =  |work = admin.ch |accessdate = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''basic income''', also called '''basic income guarantee''', '''universal basic income''' ('''UBI'''), '''basic living stipend''' ('''BLS'''), or '''universal demogrant''', is a type of program&lt;ref&gt;Basic income is distinct from [[welfare]] in that it may have no [[means test]], and distinct from the definition of [[Social security]] for the same reason; it is more like an insurance program such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States) Social Security] in the United States, which is [https://books.google.com/books?id=a5R44srUbsUC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22social%20security%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22social%20security%22&amp;f=false defined as a "federal insurance" program]; nevertheless, strictly speaking Basic income does not fit the definition of other types of programs, although it is properly categorized under the general term [[Welfare state]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which citizens (or permanent residents) of a country, or any other region, may receive a regular sum of money from a source such as the government. A pure or unconditional basic income has no [[means test]], but unlike [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security in the United States]] it is distributed automatically to all citizens without a requirement to notify changes in the citizen's financial status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ |title = History of Basic Income |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621140909/http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html |archivedate = 21 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3013634 Universal Basic Income: A Review] Social Science Research Network (SSRN).

The [[World Bank]]'s [[World Development Report]] 2019 on the future of work [http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019 describes] the existing schemes around the world.

An unconditional income that is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (at or above the [[poverty line]]), is called full basic income, while if it is less than that amount, it is called partial'''.'''  

Some welfare systems are related to basic income but have certain conditions. As these are not universal, they are more often referred to as [[guaranteed minimum income]] systems. For example, Bolsa Família in Brazil is restricted to poor families and the children are obligated to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattei|first1=Lauro|last2=Sánchez-Ancochea|first2=Diego|title=Bolsa Família, poverty and inequality: Political and economic effects in the short and long run|journal=Global Social Policy|date=2011|page=1|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1468018111421297|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A related welfare system is [[negative income tax]], in which the government stipend is gradually reduced with higher labor income.

== History ==
{{See also|Basic income around the world}}
The idea of a state-run basic income dates back to the early 16th century, when Sir [[Thomas More]] argued in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' that every person should receive a guaranteed income,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce Covert, "What Money Can Buy:  The promise of a universal basic income – and its limitations", ''[[The Nation]]'', vol. 307, no. 6 (September 10 / 17, 2018), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the late 18th century when [[Radicals (UK)|English radical]] [[Thomas Spence]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American revolutionary]] [[Thomas Paine]] both declared their support for a welfare system in which all citizens were guaranteed a certain income. In the 19th century and until the 1960s the debate on basic income was limited, but in the 1960s and 1970s the United States and Canada conducted several experiments with negative income taxation, a related welfare system. From the 1980s and onwards the debate in Europe took off more broadly and since then it has expanded to many countries around the world. A few countries have implemented large-scale welfare systems that are related to basic income, such as [[Bolsa Família]] in Brazil. From 2008 and onwards there have also been several experiments with basic income and related systems. Especially in countries with an existing welfare state a part of the funding assumably comes from replacing the current welfare arrangements, or a part of it, such as different grants for unemployed people. Apart from that there are several ideas and proposals regarding the rest of the financing, as well as different ideas about the level and other aspects.

The idea of an unconditional basic income, given to all citizens in a state (or all adult citizens), was first presented near the middle of the 19th century. But long before that there were ideas of a so-called minimum income, the idea of a one-off grant and the idea of a [[social insurance]] (which still is a key feature of all modern welfare states, with insurances for and against unemployment, sickness, parenthood, accidents, old age and so forth).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The minimum income, the idea to eradicate poverty by targeting the poor, is in contradiction with basic income given "to all", but nevertheless share some underlying ideas about the state's or the city's welfare responsibilities towards its citizens. [[Juan Luis Vives|Johannes Ludovicus Vives]] (1492–1540), for example, proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents, "not on grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity". However, to be entitled to poor relief the person’s poverty must not, he argued, be undeserved, but he or she must "deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ History of Basic Income] Basic Income Earth Network&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to develop the idea of a social insurance was [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794). After playing a prominent role in the French Revolution, he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. While in prison, he wrote the ''Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progrès de l’esprit humain'' (published posthumously by his widow in 1795), whose last chapter described his vision of a social insurance and how it could reduce inequality, insecurity and poverty. Condorcet mentioned, very briefly, the idea of a benefit to all children old enough to start working by themselves and to start up a family of their own. He is not known to have said or written anything else on this proposal, but his close friend and fellow member of the Convention Thomas Paine (1737–1809) developed the idea much further, a couple of years after Condorcet’s death.

The first social movement for basic income developed around 1920 in the United Kingdom. Its proponents included [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Dennis Milner]] (with his wife Mabel) and [[C. H. Douglas|Clifford H. Douglas]].

* Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society.
* Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple in the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled “Scheme for a State Bonus” (1918). There they argued for the "introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom". They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.
* Clifford H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system called "social credit", a combination of monetary reform and basic income.

In 1944 and 1945, the [[Beveridge Committee]], led by the British economist [[William Beveridge]], developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance and selective grants. Committee member Lady [[Rhys-Williams]] argued for basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model.&lt;ref name=sloman-2015&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/251445/Sloman%202015%20Contemporary%20British%20History.pdf |title=Beveridge's rival: Juliet Rhys-Williams and the campaign for basic income, 1942-55 |first=Peter |last=Sloman |publisher=New College, Oxford |year=2015 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Tony|title=Freedom and Security: an introduction to the basic income debate|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-22313-7|page=42|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, some welfare debates in the United States and Canada included discussions of basic income. Six pilot projects were also conducted with negative income tax. Then US president Richard Nixon once even proposed a negative income tax in a bill to the US Congress—but Congress eventually only approved a guaranteed income for the elderly and the disabled, not for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the late 1970s and the 1980s, basic income was more or less forgotten in the United States, but on the other hand it started to gain some traction in Europe. Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network, was founded in 1986 and started to arrange international conferences every two years. From the 1980s, some people outside party politics and universities took interest. In West Germany, groups of unemployed people took a stance for the reform.&lt;ref name="archiv-grundeinkommen.de"&gt;Ronald Blaschke [http://www.archiv-grundeinkommen.de/blaschke/20100127-The-Basic-Income-debate-in-Germany.pdf The basic income debate in Germany and some basic reflections] (läst 13 December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005–2010 and onwards, basic income again became an active topic in many countries. Basic income is currently discussed from a variety of perspectives—including in the context of ongoing automation and robotisation, often with the argument that these trends mean less paid work in the future, which would create a need for a new welfare model. Several countries are planning for local or regional experiments with basic income or related welfare systems. Experiments in [[India]], [[Finland]], and [[Canada]], for example, have received international media attention. Several countries have used polls to investigate public support for basic income. In 2016, 76.9% of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] voters in a national referendum rejected a basic income proposal.

==Perspectives in the basic income debate==
=== Transparency and administrative efficiency ===
Basic income is potentially a much simpler and more transparent [[welfare|welfare system]] than [[welfare state]]s currently use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Standing|first=Guy|title=How Cash Transfers Promote the Case for Basic Income|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bis.2008.3.1/bis.2008.3.1.1106/bis.2008.3.1.1106.xml?form=|journal=Basic Income Studies|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.2202/1932-0183.1106|issn=1932-0183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of separate welfare programs (including unemployment insurance, child support, pensions, disability, housing support) it could be one income, or it could be a basic payment that welfare programs could add to.&lt;ref&gt;[[G Standing]], ''Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen'' (2017) ch 7. E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN], part 4(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This could require less paperwork and bureaucracy to check eligibility. The lack of means test or similar bureaucracy would allow for saving on [[social welfare]], which could be put towards the grant. The [[Basic Income Earth Network]] (BIEN) claims that basic income costs less than current means-tested social welfare benefits, and has proposed an implementation that it claims to be financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/basic-income/faq/ |title = BIEN: frequently asked questions |last =  |first =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/research/ |title = Research |last =  |first =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network |access-date =  |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A real world example of how basic income is being implemented to save money can be seen in the program that is being conducted by the Netherlands in a few cities. The city councillor for the city of Nijmegen, Lisa Westerveld had this to say in an interview -  “In Nijmegen we get £88m to give to people on welfare, but it costs £15m a year for the civil servants running the bureaucracy of the current system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/dutch-city-utrecht-basic-income-uk-greens|title=Dutch city plans to pay citizens a ‘basic income’, and Greens say it could work in the UK|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|date=2015-12-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is also shared by Dutch historian and author Rutger Bregman who believes the Netherlands welfare system is flawed and also economist Loek Groot who believes the country welfare system wastes too much money .The outcomes of this program will be analysed by eminent economist Loek Groot, a professor at the University of Utrecht who hopes to learn if a guaranteed income might be a more effective approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/netherlands-utrecht-universal-basic-income-experiment/487883/|title=The Netherlands' Upcoming Experiment With Universal Basic Income|last=Hamilton|first=Tracy Brown|date=2016-06-21|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other proponents argue for adding basic income to existing welfare grants, rather than replacing them.

=== Poverty reduction ===

Advocates of basic income often argue that it has a potential to reduce or even [[poverty reduction|eradicate poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/06/utopian-thinking-poverty-universal-basic-income|title=Utopian thinking: the easy way to eradicate poverty – Rutger Bregman|first=Rutger|last=Bregman|date=6 March 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a randomized controlled study done by the [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] on the Give Directly program that took place in the Rarieda District of Kenya , the impact of the UBI program saw for every $1,000 disbursed a $270 increase in earnings, a $430 increase in assets, $330 increase in nutrition spending with 0% effect on alcohol or tobacco spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly|title=Research at GiveDirectly|website=GiveDirectly|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom ===

[[File:Philippe Van Parijs (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Philippe Van Parijs]]

[[Philippe van Parijs|Philippe Van Parijs]] has argued that basic income at the highest sustainable level is needed to support [[real freedom]], or the freedom to do whatever one "might want to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bostonreview.net/archives/BR25.5/vanparijs.html|title=A Basic Income for All|website=bostonreview.net|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this, Van Parijs means that all people should be free to use the resources of the Earth and the "external assets" people make out of them to do whatever they want. Money is like an access ticket to use those resources, and so to make people equally free to do what they want with world assets, the government should give each individual as many such access tickets as possible—that is, the highest sustainable basic income.

Karl Widerquist and others have proposed a theory of freedom in which basic income is needed to protect the power to refuse work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781137274724|title=Independence, Propertylessness, and Basic Income - A Theory of Freedom as the Power to Say No - K. Widerquist - Palgrave Macmillan|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory goes like this:

If some other group of people controls resources necessary to an individual's survival, that individual has no reasonable choice other than to do whatever the resource-controlling group demands. Before the establishment of governments and landlords, individuals had direct access to the resources they needed to survive. But today, resources necessary to the production of food, shelter, and clothing have been privatized in such a way that some have gotten a share and others have not. Therefore, this argument goes, the owners of those resources owe compensation back to non-owners, sufficient at least for them to purchase the resources or goods necessary to sustain their basic needs. This redistribution must be unconditional because people can consider themselves free only if they are not forced to spend all their time doing the bidding of others simply to provide basic necessities to themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012" /&gt; Under this argument, personal, political, and religious freedom are worth little without the power to say no. In this view, basic income provides an economic freedom, which—combined with political freedom, freedom of belief, and personal freedom—establish each individual's status as a free person.

=== Gender equality ===
The Scottish economist [[Ailsa McKay]] has argued that basic income is a way to promote [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="mckay1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKay |first=Ailsa |year=2005 |title= The Future of Social Security Policy: Women, Work and a Citizens Basic Income |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |page= |isbn= 9781134287185 |author-link=Ailsa McKay }}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted in 2001 that "social policy reform should take account of all gender inequalities and not just those relating to the traditional labor market" and that "the citizens' basic income model can be a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights."&lt;ref name="mckay1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKay |first1=Ailsa |author-link1=Ailsa McKay |year=2001 |title= Rethinking Work and Income Maintenance Policy: Promoting Gender Equality Through a Citizens' Basic Income |url= |journal=[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= 97–118 |doi=10.1080/13545700010022721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments from different ideologies ===

* Georgist views: [[Geolibertarian]]s seek to synthesize propertarian libertarianism and a geoist (or [[Georgist]]) philosophy of [[land (economics)|land]] as unowned commons or equally owned by all people, citing the [[classical economics|classical economic]] distinction between unimproved land and private property. The rental value of land is produced by the labors of the community and, as such, rightly belongs to the community at large and not solely to the landholder. A [[land value tax]] (LVT) is levied as an annual fee for exclusive access to a section of earth, which is collected and redistributed to the community either through [[public good]]s, such as public security or a court system, or in the form of a basic guaranteed income called a [[citizen's dividend]]. Geolibertarians view the LVT as a [[single tax]] to replace all other methods of taxation, which are deemed unjust violations of the [[non-aggression principle]].
* Right-wing views: Support for basic income has been expressed by several people associated with [[right-wing]] political views. While adherents of such views generally favor minimization or abolition of the public provision of [[welfare]] services, some have cited basic income as a viable strategy to reduce the amount of bureaucratic administration that is prevalent in many contemporary welfare systems. Others have contended that it could also act as a form of compensation for [[fiat currency]] inflation.&lt;ref name="perspectives"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2014/01/27/a-universal-basic-income-conservative-progressive-and-libertarian-perspectives-part-3-of-a-series/ |title = A Universal Basic Income: Conservative, Progressive, and Libertarian Perspectives |publisher = [[EconoMonitor]] |date = 27 January 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Dolan, Ed }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-2013-5 |title = There's A Way To Give Everyone In America An Income That Conservatives And Liberals Can Both Love |work = [[Business Insider]] |date = 13 May 2013 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Weisenthal, Joe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conservative"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/ |title = The Conservative Case for a Guaranteed Basic Income |work = [[The Atlantic]] |date = 6 August 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Gordon, Noah }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Feminist views: [[Feminist]] views on the basic income are loosely divided into two opposing views. One view supports basic income as a means of guaranteeing minimum financial independence for women, and of recognizing women's [[unpaid work]] in the home. The opposing Feminist view opposes basic income as something that might discourage women from participation in the workforce—reinforcing traditional gender roles of women belonging in the private area and men in the public area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.basicincome.org/bien/pdf/munich2012/katada.pdf | title=Basic Income and Feminism: in terms of "the gender division of labor" | author=Kaori Katada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gcu.ac.uk/wise/media/gcalwebv2/theuniversity/centresprojects/wise/90324WiSE_BriefingSheet.pdf | title=Beyond Care: Expanding the Feminist Debate on Universal Basic Income | publisher=WiSE | date=September 2015 | author=Caitlin McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===

One argument against basic income is that if people have free and unconditional money, they will "get lazy" and not work as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:198164 |title = urn:nbn:se:su:diva-7385: Just Distribution : Rawlsian Liberalism and the Politics of Basic Income |publisher = Diva-portal.org |accessdate = 16 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cangov94"&gt;{{cite web |author = Gilles Séguin |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm#Disposable |title = ''Improving Social Security in Canada – Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper'', Government of Canada, 1994 |publisher = Canadiansocialresearch.net |accessdate = 16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plcdib/imprints/vanparijsinterview.html The Need for Basic Income]: An Interview with [[Philippe Van Parijs]], ''Imprints'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (March 1997). The interview was conducted by Christopher Bertram.&lt;/ref&gt; Less work means less tax revenue, argue critics, and hence less money for the state and cities to fund public projects. The degree of any disincentive to employment because of basic income would likely depend on how generous the basic income was.

Some studies have looked at employment levels during the experiments with basic income and negative income tax, and similar systems. In the negative income tax-experiments in United States in the 1970s, for example, there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for the main earner. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher. Participants in these experiments, however, knew that the experiment was limited in time.&lt;ref name="cangov94" /&gt; 

In the [[Mincome]] experiment in rural Dauphin, Manitoba, also in the 1970s, there were also slight reductions in hours worked during the experiment. However, the only two groups who worked significantly less were new mothers and teenagers working to support their families. New mothers spent this time with their infant children, and working teenagers put significant additional time into their schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Belik |first = Vivian |url = http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/4100 |title = A Town Without Poverty? Canada's only experiment in guaranteed income finally gets reckoning |publisher = Dominionpaper.ca |date = 5 September 2011 |accessdate = 16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mincome, "The reduction of work effort was modest: about one per cent for men, three per cent for wives, and five per cent for unmarried women."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.irpp.org/po/archive/jan01/hum.pdf A guaranteed annual income: From Mincome to the millennium (PDF)] Derek Hum and Wayne Simpson&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to a recent study done on the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend which is the most large scale universal basic income program in the United States that has been running since 1976 has showed that this belief is not true. The researchers from University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy professor Damon Jones and University of Pennsylvania School of Public Policy and Practice professor Ioana Marinescu have established that even though there is only a very small decrease in work done by recipients due to various reasons like the ones we saw in the Manitoba experiment,however there has been a 17 percent increase in part time jobs.The authors theorized employment remained steady because the extra income that allowed people to buy more also increased demand for service jobs, a finding consistent with the economic data of the time. There was no effect seen when it came to jobs, such as those in manufacturing, that produce exports. Essentially, the authors argue, macro-economic effects of higher spending supported overall employment.To use an illustrative but hypothetical example, someone who uses her dividend to help with car payments can cut back on her hours working as a cashier at a local grocery store. But because more people are spending more, the store will look to replace that worker who started working less. Meanwhile, the distribution of the dividend won't affect the international demand for oil and the jobs connected to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/|title=A universal basic income experiment in Alaska shows employment didn't drop — Quartz|website=qz.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alaska-universal-basic-income-employment-2018-10|title=Critics of universal basic income argue giving people money for nothing discourages working — but a study of Alaska's 36-year-old program suggests that's not the case|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Jones and Marinescu found instead that the larger scale of the program is what allows it to work, and not dissuade people out of the work force.

Another study that contradicted such decline in work incentive was a pilot project implemented in 2008 and 2009 in the Namibian village of [[Omitara]]; the assessment of the project after its conclusion found that economic activity actually increased, particularly through the launch of small businesses, and reinforcement of the local market by increasing households' buying power.&lt;ref name="bignam"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bignam.org/BIG_pilot.html |title = Basic Income Grant Coalition: Pilot Project |publisher = BIG Coalition Namibia |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the residents of Omitara were described as suffering "dehumanising levels of poverty" before the introduction of the pilot, and as such the project's relevance to potential implementations in developed economies is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Otjivero residents to get bridging allowance as BIG pilot ends |url = http://www.namibian.com.na/news-articles/national/full-story/archive/2009/december/article/otjivero-residents-to-get-bridging-allowance-as-big-pilot-ends/ |accessdate = 28 July 2016 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303041632/http://www.namibian.com.na/news-articles/national/full-story/archive/2009/december/article/otjivero-residents-to-get-bridging-allowance-as-big-pilot-ends/ |archivedate = 3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Meade]] states that a return to [[full employment]] can only be achieved if, among other things, workers offer their services at a low enough price that the required wage for unskilled labor would be too low to generate a socially desirable distribution of income. He therefore concludes that a "citizen's income" is necessary to achieve full employment without suffering stagnant or negative growth in wages.&lt;ref&gt;Meade, James Edward. ''Full Employment Regained?'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-521-55697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is a disincentive to employment because of basic income, the magnitude of such a disincentive may depend on how generous the basic income was. Some campaigners in Switzerland have suggested a level that would be only just liveable, arguing that people would want to supplement it.&lt;ref name="harford"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://timharford.com/2013/11/a-universal-income-is-not-such-a-silly-idea/ |title = Tim Harford — Article —  A universal income is not such a silly idea |author = Wolf Chiappella |work = Tim Harford |accessdate = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Worstall]], a writer, blogger and Senior Fellow of the [[Adam Smith Institute]],&lt;ref name="ASI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/about-us/key-people/fellows/page/2/ |title=Fellows |publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]] |accessdate=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that traditional welfare schemes create a disincentive to work because such schemes typically cause people to lose benefits at around the same rate that their income rises (a form of [[welfare trap]] where the [[marginal tax rate]] is 100 percent). He has asserted that this particular disincentive is not a property shared by basic income since the rate of increase is positive at all incomes.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/07/12/an-unconditional-basic-income-is-the-solution-but-the-important-word-here-is-basic/ |publisher = Forbes |first = Tim |last = Worstall |title = Forbes article |date = 12 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bad behavior ===

There are concerns that some people will spend their basic income on alcohol and other drugs.&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koga, Kenya. "Pennies From Heaven." Economist 409.8859 (2013): 67–68. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies of the impact of direct cash transfer programs provide evidence to the contrary. A 2014 [[World Bank]] review of 30 scientific studies concludes that "concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco consumption are unfounded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

===Reduction of medical costs ===

The [[Canadian Medical Association]] passed a motion in 2015 in clear support of basic income and for basic income trials in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/08/26/basic-income-just-what-the-doctor-ordered.html|title=Opinion - Basic income: just what the doctor ordered|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], a British journalist, has stated that universal basic income would probably reduce the high medical costs associated with diseases of poverty. The stress, diseases like high blood pressure, type II diabetes etc. would according to Mason probably become less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQyr9l22fLE |title = Paul Mason: 'PostCapitalism'&amp;nbsp;– Talks at Google |first =  |last = Talks at Google |date = 3 March 2016 |publisher =  |accessdate = 28 July 2016 |via = YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage slavery and alienation ===

[[Frances Fox Piven]] argues that an income guarantee would benefit all workers by liberating them from the anxiety that results from the "tyranny of [[wage slavery]]" and provide opportunities for people to pursue different occupations and develop untapped potentials for creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Goldin, Debby Smith, Michael Smith (2014). ''Imagine: Living in a Socialist USA.'' [[Harper Perennial]]. {{ISBN|0-06-230557-3}} p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[André Gorz]] saw basic income as a necessary adaptation to the increasing automation of work, yet basic income also enables workers to overcome the [[Social alienation|alienation]] in work and life and to increase the amount of [[leisure time]].&lt;ref&gt;André Gorz, [http://societal.org/docs/55.htm Pour un revenu inconditionnel suffisant], published in Transversales/Science-Culture (n° 3, 3e trimestre 2002) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic growth ===

Some proponents have argued that basic income can increase [[economic growth]] because it would sustain people while they invest in education to get interesting and well-paid jobs.&lt;ref name="Tanner, Michael 2015"&gt;Tanner, Michael. "The Pros and Cons of a Guaranteed National Income." Policy Analysis. CATO institute, 12 May 2015, Web. 2, 7 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012"&gt;Sheahen, Allan. Basic Income Guarantee: Your Right to Economic Security. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. Book. 29 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also a discussion of basic income within the [[degrowth]] movement, which argues against economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2016/08/basic-income-sustainable-consumption-degrowth-movement/|title=Basic Income, sustainable consumption and the 'DeGrowth' movement   {{!}} BIEN|date=2016-08-13|newspaper=BIEN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Automation ===

The debates about basic income and automation are closely linked. For example, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] argues that the increase in automation creates a greater need for basic income. Concerns about automation have prompted many in the high-technology industry to argue for basic income as an implication of their business models.

Many technologists believe that automation (among other things) is creating [[technological unemployment]]. Journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] first highlighted the turn of the "tech elite" to these ideas with an article in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine, which cited [[Marc Andreessen]], [[Sam Altman]], [[Peter Diamandis]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1|title=Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|date=6 January 2015|publisher=Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obamawhitehouse.archives.gov"&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf whitehouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Schneider |first = Nathan |title = Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income |date = 6 January 2015 |url = https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1 |publisher = Vice }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies about automation and jobs validate these concerns. The US White House, in a report to the US Congress, estimated that a worker earning less than $20 an hour in 2010 will eventually lose their job to a machine with 83% probability. Even workers earning as much as $40 an hour faced a probability of 31%.&lt;ref name="obamawhitehouse.archives.gov"/&gt; With a rising [[unemployment]] rate, poor communities will become more impoverished worldwide. Proponents of universal basic income argue that it could solve many world problems like high work stress and could create more opportunities and efficient and effective work. This claim is supported by some studies. In a study in Dauphin, Manitoba, only 13% of labor decreased from a much higher expected number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forget |first=Evelyn L. |title=The Town With No Poverty: The Health Effects of a Canadian Guaranteed Annual Income Field Experiment |journal=Canadian Public Policy |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=283–305 |doi=10.3138/cpp.37.3.283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in several Indian villages, basic income in the region raised the education rate of young people by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Abhishek |last=Roy |work=Sevenpillarsinstitute.org |accessdate=16 July 2017 |title=Part 2 of SPI’s Universal Basic Income Series |url=http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/universal-basic-income-empirical-studies/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Yang , an upcoming presidential candidate talks about how automation is negatively affecting real people when it takes over their jobs in his book The War On Normal People, he says that even though automation might make the economy and market more efficient it is not being used positively to help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029200003|title=The war on normal people : the truth about America's disappearing jobs and why universal basic income is our future.|last=(Entrepreneur),|first=Yang, Andrew|isbn=9780316414227|edition=First edition|location=New York|oclc=1029200003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not creating enough new jobs than the number of old jobs it is replacing. An example of this is - In 2004, BlockBuster was making $6 billion with 84,000 employees. Netflix has so far made $9 billion dollars with only 4,500 employees. Other places where automation is rapidly replacing people is self driving cars, nearly 3 million jobs in the US will be replaced in the next 10 years it is not a question of if they will be replaced but how quickly they will be displaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Ella_alderson/these-jobs-are-most-at-stake-to-be-replaced-by-robots-ce4096c2ceb9|title=These Jobs are Most at Stake to be Replaced by Robots|last=Alderson|first=Ella|date=2018-05-13|website=Medium|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one problem most critics of automation don't realise and argue that automation will create new jobs, but automation is so different this time compared to the Industrial Revolution because peoples livelihood is being displaced in an unprecedented scale and when these people lose the option to pursue these kinds of jobs they will have to be retrained and even then they might not be hired and leave the workforce entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029200003|title=The war on normal people : the truth about America's disappearing jobs and why universal basic income is our future.|last=(Entrepreneur),|first=Yang, Andrew|isbn=9780316414227|edition=First edition|location=New York|oclc=1029200003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides technological unemployment, some tech-industry experts worry that automation will destabilize the labor market or increase economic inequality. One example is Chris Hughes, co-founder of both [[Facebook]] and Economic Security Project. Automation has been happening for hundreds of years; it has not permanently reduced the employment rate but has constantly caused employment instability. It displaces workers who spend their lives learning skills that become outmoded and forces them into unskilled labor. [[Paul Vallée]], a Canadian tech-entrepreneur and CEO of [[Pythian Group|Pythian]], argues that automation is at least as likely to increase poverty and reduce social mobility than it is to create ever-increasing unemployment rate. At the 2016 North American Basic Income Guarantee Congress in Winnipeg, Vallée examined slavery as a historical example of a period in which capital (African slaves) could do the same things that human labor (poor whites) could do. He found that slavery did not cause massive unemployment among poor whites, but instead increased economic inequality and lowered social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZbXto44n1sKTVgrfl8u_p9vrgoS7WXX0O_le39GyyM/edit#slide=id.p4|title=Paul Vallee, Basic Income, for publication|work=Google Docs|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic critique ===

[[Daron Acemoglu]], Professor in economics at MIT, has expressed doubts about basic income with the following statement: "Current US status quo is horrible. A more efficient and generous social safety net is needed. But UBI is expensive and not generous enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/437296/economists-against-ubi |title = Majority of Economists Surveyed Are against the Universal Basic Income |access-date = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Maskin]] has stated that "a minimum income makes sense, but not at the cost of eliminating Social Security and Medicare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_bPBNf8WXrT4jmtf|title=Poll Results {{!}} IGM Forum|website=www.igmchicago.org|access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[Simeon Djankov]], professor at the [[London School of Economics]], argues the costs of a generous system are prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Yang , the presidential candidate wants to provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen between 18 and 64 years old. He wants to achieve this by introducing a Value Added Tax  he says even conservatives have known that a [[Value-added tax|VAT]] was going to be necessary at some point in the future, and this is a great opportunity for us to rebalance our economy. We’re the only major economy that doesn’t have a VAT right now; it’s going to be increasingly necessary given the progressive automation we’re already experiencing.

===Basic income as a part of a post-capitalistic economic system===

[[File:ErikOlinWright.2013.jpg|thumb|right|Erik Olin Wright, 2013.]]
   
Harry Shutt proposed basic income and other measures to make all or most enterprises collective rather than private. These measures would create a post-capitalist economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Shutt |first = Harry |title = Beyond the Profits System: Possibilities for the Post-Capitalist Era |publisher = Zed Books |date = 15 March 2010 |isbn = 978-1-84813-417-1 |page = 124 |quote = a flat rate payment as of right to all resident citizens over the school leaving age, irrespective of means of employment status...it would in principle replace all existing social-security entitlements with the exception of child benefits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
[[Erik Olin Wright]] characterizes basic income as a project for reforming capitalism into an economic system by empowering labor in relation to capital, granting labor greater bargaining power with employers in labor markets, which can gradually de-commodify labor by decoupling work from income. This would allow for an expansion in scope of the "social economy", by granting citizens greater means to pursue activities (such as the pursuit of art) that do not yield strong financial returns.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Erik Olin. [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/Basic%20Income%20as%20a%20Socialist%20Project.pdf "Basic Income as a Socialist Project,"] paper presented at the annual US-BIG Congress, 4 – 6 March 2005 (University of Wisconsin, March 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
James Meade advocated for a social dividend scheme to be funded by publicly owned [[Means of production|productive assets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mediahell.org/capitalsocial.htm |title = Basic Income |publisher = Media Hell |accessdate = 9 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell argued for a basic income alongside public ownership as a means of shortening the average working day and achieving full employment.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''Roads to Freedom. Socialism, Anarchism and Syndicalism'', London: Unwin Books (1918), pp. 80–81 and 127&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Economists and sociologists have advocated for a form of basic income as a way to distribute economic profits of publicly owned enterprises to benefit the entire population (also referred to as a ''[[social dividend]]''), where the basic income payment represents the return to each citizen on the capital owned by society. These systems would be directly financed from returns on publicly owned assets and are featured as major components of many models of [[market socialism]].&lt;ref name="Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor = 40470892  |title = Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism |last = Marangos |first = John |journal = International Journal of Political Economy |volume = 34 |issue = 3 |year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guy Standing]] has proposed financing a [[social dividend]] from a democratically-accountable [[sovereign wealth fund]] built up primarily from the proceeds of a levy on rentier income derived from ownership or control of assets - physical, financial and intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Standing, Guy. "Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen, London: Penguin (2017){{cite web | url = https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/304706/basic-income/ |accessdate = 1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standing, Guy.

[[Herman Daly]], considered as one of the founders of [[ecologism]], argued primarily for a [[Steady-state economy|zero growth economy]] within the ecological limits of the planet. But to have such a green and [[sustainable economy]], including basic economic welfare and security to all people, he wrote a lot about the need for structural reforms of the capitalistic system, including basic income, monetary reform, [[land value tax]], trade reforms and higher [[eco-taxes]] (taxes on pollution and CO2). For him, basic income was thus part of a larger structural change of the economic system, towards a more green and sustainable system.

==National debates (a few examples) ==

{{Main|Basic income around the world}}

===Germany===

A commission of the [[Bundestag|German parliament]] discussed basic income in 2013 and concluded that it is "unrealizable" because:
* it would cause a significant decrease in the motivation to work among citizens, with unpredictable consequences for the national economy
* it would require a complete restructuring of the taxation, social insurance and pension systems, which will cost a significant amount of money
* the current system of social help in Germany is regarded as more effective because it is more personalized: the amount of help provided depends on the financial situation of the recipient; for some socially vulnerable groups, the basic income could be insufficient
* it would cause a vast increase in immigration
* it would cause a rise in the [[shadow economy]]
* the corresponding rise of taxes would cause more inequality: higher taxes would cause higher prices of everyday products, harming the finances of poor people
* no viable way to finance basic income in Germany was found&lt;ref name="bundestag.de"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2010/31904334_kw45_pa_petitionen/203030 |title = Deutscher Bundestag – Problematische Auswirkungen auf Arbeitsanreize |language = de |publisher = Bundestag.de |date =  |accessdate = 5 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/petitionen/_2008/_12/_10/Petition_1422.abschlussbegruendungpdf.pdf|title=Petitionen: Verwendung von Cookies nicht aktiviert&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

India has been considering [[Basic income in India|basic income in India.]] On January 31, 2017, the Economic Survey of India included a 40-page chapter on UBI that outlined the 3 components of the proposed program: 1) universality, 2) unconditionality, 3) agency. The UBI proposal in India is framed with the intent of providing every citizen "a basic income to cover their needs," which is encompassed by the "universality" component. "Unconditionality" points to the accessibility of all to the basic income, without any means tests. The third component, "agency," refers to the lens through which the Indian government views the poor. According to the Survey, by treating the poor as agents rather than subjects, UBI "liberates citizens from paternalistic and clientelistic relationships with the state."

=== The Alaska Permanent Fund ===
The [[Alaska Permanent Fund|Permanent Fund of Alaska]] in the United States provides a kind of basic income, based on the oil and gas revenues of the state, to (nearly) all state residents. During her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]], along with [[Bill Clinton|her husband]], considered including a policy similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund called "Alaska for America" as part of their platform after reading [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] book on the subject ''With Liberty and Dividends for All''. Ultimately, the Clintons decided not to, with Hillary stating in her [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]] memoir ''[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]'', "Unfortunately, we couldn't make the numbers work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|title=Hillary Clinton almost ran for president on a universal basic income|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/12/16296532/hillary-clinton-universal-basic-income-alaska-for-america-peter-barnes|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in retrospect Clinton also said, "I wonder now whether we should have thrown caution to the wind and embraced 'Alaska for America' as a long-term goal and figured out the details later", considering that former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretaries]] [[James Baker]] and [[Henry Paulson]] have also proposed a similar nationwide policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clinton|first=Hillary|author-link=Hillary Clinton|title=[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|place=New York|date=September 12, 2017|isbn=978-1-50117-556-5|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker et al. 2017"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Baker III|first1=James A.|author-link1=James Baker|last2=Feldstein|first2=Martin S.|author-link2=Martin Feldstein|last3=Halstead|first3=Ted|author-link3=Ted Halstead|last4=Mankiw|first4=N.

=== Experiments ===
There are also several smaller experiments, which have been labeled as "basic income pilots". The best known are:

* Experiments with [[negative income tax]] in United States and Canada in the 1960s and 1970s.
* The province of [[Manitoba, Canada]], experimented with [[Mincome]], a basic guaranteed income in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouversun.com/business/local-business/innovation-series-feature-on-the-gig-economy|title=Innovation series: Does the gig economy mean 'endless possibilities' or the death of jobs?|date=8 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quasi - UBI Programs ===
[[Bolsa Família]] is a big social welfare program in Brazil that provides money to many poor families in the country. The system is related to basic income, but also has some differences in that there are some conditions like asking the recipients to keep their children in school till graduation. Brazilian Senator [[Eduardo Suplicy]] championed a law, ultimately passed in 2004, that declared Bolsa Família to be a first step towards a national basic income. However, the program has not yet been expanded in that direction.

[[Rythu Bandhu scheme]], is a welfare scheme started on 10 May 2018 aimed towards helping farmers that is being implemented by the State of [[Telangana]] in India where each farmland owner gets a fixed amount of money ₹4000 per acre twice a year for [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] and [[Kharif crop|Kharif]] harvests. A budget allocation of ₹12,000 crores($138 billion at the time of conversion) was made in 2018-19 state budget, the scheme offers a financial help of ₹8,000 per year to each farmer (two crops), and there is no cap on money disbursed to number of acres of land owned and it does not discriminate between rich or poor land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/telangana-proposes-rs-5l-insurance-cover-rs-12000-crore-support-scheme-for-farmers/articleshow/63319240.cms|title=Telangana proposes Rs 5L insurance cover, Rs 12,000 crore support scheme for farmers|date=2018-03-15|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] has been monitoring the program and is doing a study which is yet to be published, but preliminary results have already shown promising results in getting farmers the welfare needed to make investments for farming and procuring fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and other inputs, serving the purpose of the scheme. The first phase of the survey concluded that 85 % of farmers received check's for amounts ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹20,000 for farm land comprising less than an acre to about five acres and about 10% of farmers received check's for amounts above ₹20,000 to ₹50,000 and only 1% of farmers got amounts more than ₹50,000. The spending pattern revealed that a large chunk, 28.5 % of farmers opted to buy seed, about 18% spent the money on fertilizer, 15.4% on new agricultural assets, including farm equipment , 8.6% on pesticides and some used it to engage farm labor and only 4.4 % of beneficiaries said they utilized it for household consumption and a minuscule percentage for repayment of loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ryots-spent-rythu-bandhu-amount-judiciously-survey/article24235239.ece|title=Ryots spent Rythu Bandhu amount judiciously: survey|last=Maitreyi|first=M. l Melly|date=2018-06-23|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scheme received a high satisfaction rate of 92% from farmers since other forms of capital investment like welfare or loans had many strings attached to it and would not reach the farmers before the cropping season starts, many other states and countries are following the development of the program to see if they can implement it for their farmers. Since farmers worldwide are facing many difficulties and in a lot of countries it has become unprofitable, governments are either proving subsidies, welfare or loans but this a new type of program that is considered as an embryonic UBI or QUBI (Quasi) to replace traditional systems of agricultural support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/quasi-ubi-rythu-bandhu-can-be-the-social-agri-policy-template/1239581/|title=Quasi-UBI: Rythu Bandhu can be the social &amp; agri policy&amp;nbsp;template|date=2018-07-11|work=The Financial Express|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioregionalism''' is a [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[Ecology|ecological]] system or set of views based on naturally defined areas called [[bioregion]]s, similar to [[ecoregion]]s. Bioregions are defined through physical and environmental features, including [[Drainage basin|watershed]] boundaries and [[soil]] and [[terrain]] characteristics. Bioregionalism stresses that the determination of a bioregion is also a [[culture|cultural]] phenomenon, and emphasizes local populations, knowledge, and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/260/385 Bioregionalism: The Need For a Firmer Theoretical Foundation]{{dead link|date=October 2017}}", Don Alexander, Trumpeter v13.3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregionalism asserts "that a bioregion’s environmental components (geography, climate, plant life, animal life, etc.) directly influence ways for human communities to act and interact with each other which are, in turn, optimal for those communities to thrive in their environment. As such, those ways to thrive in their totality—be they economic, cultural, spiritual, or political—will be distinctive in some capacity as being a product of their bioregional environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://towardscascadia.com/2015/11/15/bioregionalism-place-shapes-identity/|title=Bioregionalism: Place Shapes Identity|last=M|first=Ryan|date=2015-11-15|website=Towards Cascadia|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregionalism is a concept that goes beyond [[national boundaries]]—an example is the concept of [[Cascadia (independence movement)|Cascadia]], a region that is sometimes considered to consist of most of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the [[Alaska Panhandle]], the far north of [[California]] and the [[West Coast of Canada]], sometimes also including some or all of [[Idaho]] and [[western Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cascadiaprospectus.org/2010/02/cascadia_the_new_frontier.php |title=Cascadia: The New Frontier |publisher=Cascadia Prospectus |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312125000/http://www.cascadiaprospectus.org/2010/02/cascadia_the_new_frontier.php |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a bioregion, which does not cross national boundaries, but does overlap state lines, is [[the Ozarks]], a bioregion also referred to as the Ozarks Plateau, which consists of southern [[Missouri]], northwest [[Arkansas]], the northeast corner of [[Oklahoma]], southeast corner of [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/|work=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogregions are not synonymous with ecoregions as defined by bodies such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] or the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]]; the later are scientifically based and focused on wildlife and vegetation. Bioregions, by contrast are human regions, informed by nature but with a social and political element. In this way bioregionalism is simply [[political localism]] with an ecological foundation.

The term was coined by Allen Van Newkirk, founder of the Institute for Bioregional Research, in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Michael Vincent|title=Bioregionalism|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=041515444-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; given currency by [[Peter Berg (bioregionalist)|Peter Berg]] and [[Raymond Dasmann]] in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Peter and Raymond Dasmann, "Reinhabiting California," ''The Ecologist'' 7, no. 10 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been advocated by writers such as [https://books.google.ca/books?id=n42Rf_ibaMcC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=david+haenke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1AM-OxjlTj&amp;sig=1LBacDKoY42fT8ZcHu5eDmfQ46A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiox6e2qevKAhVFsoMKHQU6DCIQ6AEIRTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20haenke&amp;f=false David Haenke] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Walter Truett. [https://archive.is/20120529125505/http://motherjones.com/print/16589 There's no going back to nature], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' (September/October 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bioregionalist perspective opposes a homogeneous economy and consumer culture with its lack of stewardship towards the environment. This perspective seeks to:
*Ensure that political boundaries match ecological boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, S. (2007) "The Troubled Marriage of Deep Ecology and Bioregionalism," ''Environmental Values'', vol. 16(3): 313-332&lt;/ref&gt;
*Highlight the unique [[ecology]] of the bioregion.
*Encourage consumption of [[local food]]s where possible.
*Encourage the use of local [[natural resource|materials]] where possible.
*Encourage the cultivation of [[indigenous (ecology)|native plants]] of the region.
*Encourage [[sustainability]] in harmony with the bioregion.&lt;ref&gt;Bastedo, Jamie. ''Shield Country: The Life and Times of the Oldest Piece of the Planet'', Red Deer Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-88995-191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioregional mapping''' is a powerful tool to increase understanding, change the story and influence policy.  A good bioregional map shows layers of geology, flora, fauna, and inhabitation over time. All the interdisciplinary content that is integrated in this kind of map makes it a great communication tool to illustrate an ecological approach. One of the best examples of a richly communicative bioregional map is David McClosky's [http://cascadia-institute.org/ new map of Cascadia].

==Relationship to environmentalism==

Bioregionalism, while akin to [[environmentalism]] in certain aspects, such as a desire to live in harmony with [[nature]], differs in certain ways from classical, 20th century environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peter Berg, bioregionalism is [[proactive]], and is based on forming a harmony between human culture and the natural environment, rather than being [[protest]]-based like the original environmental movement. Also, while classical environmentalists saw human industry as the [[enemy]] of nature and nature as a victim needing to be saved; bioregionalists see humanity and its culture as a part of nature, focusing on building a positive, sustainable relationship with the environment, rather than a focus on preserving and segregating the [[wilderness]] from the world of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
North American Bioregional Assemblies have been bi-annual gatherings of bioregionalists throughout North America since 1984 and have given rise to national level [[Green Parties]]. In addition, bioregionalism spawned the sustainability movement{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The tenets of bioregionalism are often used by green movements, which oppose political organizations whose boundaries conform to existing electoral districts.  This problem is perceived to result in elected representatives voting in accordance with their constituents, some of whom may live outside a defined bioregion, and may run counter to the well-being of the bioregion.

At the local level, several bioregions have congresses that meet regularly. For instance, the Ozark Plateau bioregion hosts a yearly Ozark Area Community Congress, better known as OACC, which has been meeting every year since 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/|work=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; most often on the first weekend in October. The Kansas Area Watershed, "KAW" was founded in 1982 and has been meeting regularly since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas Area Watershed Council History|url=http://kawcouncil.wordpress.com/about/history/|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; KAW holds a yearly meeting, usually in the spring.

The government of the Canadian province of Alberta has recently made major amendments to its land-use policies including a separate "land-use framework" document for each major [[river basin]] within the province.  This is supported by local initiatives such as the [[Beaver Hills (Alberta)|Beaver Hills]] Initiative, which seeks to create a large [[biosphere reserve]] encompassing [[Elk Island National Park]] and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beaverhills.ca/|title=Home {{!}} Beaver Hills Initiative|website=www.beaverhills.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black Sash.jpg|thumb|Black Sash demonstration between 1955 and 1960]]
The '''Black Sash''' was a non-violent liberal white women's resistance organisation that was founded on 19 May 1955 in [[South Africa]] by Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza, and Helen Newton-Thompson.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/our-legacy/our-history |title=The Beginning of the Sash 1955-1956 |access-date=2015-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426012713/http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/our-legacy/our-history |archive-date=2015-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Black Sash was founded on 19 May 1955 by six middle-class women, Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza and Helen Newton-Thompson.&lt;ref name=Black/&gt; The organisation was founded as the ''Women’s Defence of the Constitution League'' but was eventually shortened by the press as the Black Sash due to the women's habit of wearing black sashes at their protest meetings.&lt;ref name="Villa"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Spirit of Freedom: South African Leaders on Religion and Politics | publisher=University of California Press | author=Villa-Vicencio, Charles | year=1996 | isbn=978-0520200456}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} These black sashes symbolised the mourning for the South Africa Constitution.&lt;ref name=Villa/&gt;{{rp|79}} The founding members gathered for tea in Johannesburg before they decided to organise a movement against the Senate Act. They succeeded to hold a vigil of 2 000 women who marched from [[Joubert Park]] to the [[Johannesburg City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natalia.org.za/Files/Publications/Black%20Sash%20book.pdf|title=STANDING ON STREET CORNERS|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|format=PDF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Sash initially campaigned against the removal of [[Coloured]] or mixed race voters from the voters' roll in the [[Cape Province]] by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government. As the [[apartheid]] system began to reach into every aspect of South African life, Black Sash members demonstrated against the [[Pass Laws]] and the introduction of other apartheid legislation. It would later open Advice Offices to provide information concerning their legal rights to non-white South African's affected by that legislation.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ynOFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=black+sash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinoLnY0cveAhXLR30KHSXoCDo4FBDoAQg4MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20sash&amp;f=false|title=Women, Ethnicity and Nationalism: The Politics of Transition|last=Miller|first=Robert E.|last2=Wilford|first2=Rick|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9781134695492|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Its members "''used the relative safety of their privileged racial classification to speak out against the erosion of human rights in the country. Their striking black sashes were worn as a mark of mourning and to protest against the succession of unjust laws. But they were not only on the streets. Volunteers spent many hours in the national network of advice offices and in the monitoring of courts and pass offices.''" (Speech by Marcella Naidoo, National Director of the Black Sash, June 2005)

Between 1955 and 1994, the Black Sash provided widespread and visible proof of white resistance towards the apartheid system. Its members worked as volunteer advocates to families affected by apartheid laws; held regular street demonstrations; spoke at political meetings; brought cases of injustice to the attention of their Members of Parliament, and kept vigils outside Parliament and government offices. Many members were vilified within their local white communities, and it was not unusual for women wearing the black sash to be physically attacked by supporters of apartheid.

In the 1980s it was part of the National Land Committee assisting the non-white communities that were subject to forced land removals.&lt;ref name=Mill/&gt;{{rp|61}} It would also be involved on the Rural Women's Movement, supporting rural non-white women rights in regards to inheritance and land ownership.&lt;ref name=Mill/&gt;{{rp|61}} In 1983, the organisation called for the abolition of military conscription.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOHHNsobjPIC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=the+black+sash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHrM7ZtqzYAhXJuxQKHadjDUkQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20black%20sash&amp;f=false|title=Women in South African History: They Remove Boulders and Cross Rivers|last=Gasa|first=Nomboniso|date=2007|publisher=HSRC Press|year=|isbn=9780796921741|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Apartheid==
The Black Sash's resistance movement came to an end in the early 1990s with the end of apartheid, the unbanning of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and the release of [[Nelson Mandela]] from imprisonment. Its role was recognised by Nelson Mandela on his release and by subsequent political leaders. The organisation was reformed in 1995 as a non-racial humanitarian organisation, working to 'make human rights real for all living in South Africa'.

In May 2015, the organisation celebrated its 60th anniversary as it shifted its focus towards education, training, advocacy and community monitoring. The celebration of the Black Sash history was also marked by the launching of two books, namely ''Standing on Street Corners: a History of the Natal Midlands Region of the Black Sash'' and ''a'' biography by Annemarie Hendrikz''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-05-14-the-conscience-of-white-south-africa-celebrating-the-black-sash-60-years-later/#.WkS97t8oRhE|title=‘The conscience of white South Africa’: Celebrating the Black Sash, 60 years later {{!}} Daily Maverick|website=www.dailymaverick.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|According to Tilly, the [[French Revolution]] unfolded from protests against the high taxes the French rulers imposed to balance for the expensive [[American Revolutionary War|American War]].]]
Tilly asks a double question in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', namely: "What accounts for the great variation over time and space in the kinds of states that have prevailed in Europe since AD 990, and why did European states eventually converge on different variants of the national state?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to Tilly's theory, military innovation in pre-modern Europe, especially the use of gunpowder and mass armies, made war considerably more expensive. In order to continue to fund warfare, conquest, and security, only states with sufficient capital and a large population could afford paying for their security and ultimately surviving in a hostile environment. Those in power were forced to develop a means of extraction by, for example, introducing taxation and conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|title = Comparative Perspectives on the State|last = Barkey|first = Karen|date = August 1991|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|first2 = Sunita|last2 = Parikh|issue = 17|pages = 523–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these means of extraction resulted in the creation of state bureaucracies and a centralized state.

The type of state that develops is dependent on the structure of the area. In areas where merchants and capital were the predominant class, city states arose, such as Venice. In areas where independent landlords were the predominant class, centralized absolutism arose, such as Russia. If an area would have both classes more or less equal, a combination of state forms would develop, for example as happened in France and England, according to Tilly. Eventually, all states will develop into the type of state form that Tilly calls the [[nation state]].

With this theory, Tilly questions previous formulations of state development in Europe, arguing that they are unsuccessful in explaining the great variety in kinds of states that have prevailed at different stages of European history since AD 990. He say that they fail "because they locate explanations of state-to-state variation in individual characteristics of states rather than relations among them, and because they assume implicitly a deliberate effect to construct the sorts of substantial, centralized states that come to dominate European life during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Unlike other theories, like the idea of the [[social contract]], Tilly stated that "[w]ar wove the European network of national states, and preparation for war created the internal structures of states within it."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isnblog.ethz.ch/international-relations/charles-tilly-ad-990-1992-twenty-years-on|title=Charles Tilly, AD 990-1992: Twenty Years On|last=Lindberg|first=Marten|date=November 2011|website=The International Relations and Security Work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction between the rulers on the hand and the manipulators of capital on the other, resulted in three state formations, Tilly argues. These state formations are tribute-taking empires, systems of fragmented sovereignty, and national states.

=== From Militarization to Civilianization ===
Tilly notes a "central paradox" in his theory of European state building: "the pursuit of war and military capacity, after having created national states as a sort of by-product, led to a civilianization of government and domestic politics".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Tilly, this transfer of power from armed forces to civilian entities was not so much a tug-of-war but rather happened incrementally. The ''nature'' of power—coercion—did not change, but the individuals that wielded it did. Tilly provides five main reasons for this incremental transition (p.&amp;nbsp;206):
# The building up and maintenance of military forces required massive extractive structures that were run by civilians, eventually forming a counterweight to the same military forces;
# War making forced states to legitimize civilian input since it had to bargain for necessary resources with civilian entities;
# War making dramatically expanded the state and did not downsize its capacities at the end of conflicts;
# Individuals involved in war making were promised dues at the end of the war, and thus legitimately claimed their dues at demobilization;
# Borrowing during conflicts led to bureaucracies being created to service the skyrocketing state debts, which in turn encouraged states to intervene in the local economy.

=== State Building in the Developing World ===
[[Jeffrey Herbst]] is an example of a scholar that builds on Tilly's theory. Herbst explains the relative failure of state building in Africa by the lack of external threats that forced European leaders to concentrate capital and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = War and the State in Africa|jstor = 2538753|journal = International Security|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 117–139|volume = 14|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2538753|first = Jeffrey|last = Herbst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tilly concludes his book, however, emphasizing caution in applying his model to contemporary [[state-building]]. the Tilly argues that the militarization of politics in many developing countries should not be understood as a step towards the development of a stable nation state. He asserts that current conditions of state formation today (at the time of writing, in 1990) are vastly different from what they were in Europe over his study period. First, Tilly notes that the military apparatus in developing countries today is not generally concerned with conquering or defending territory, as opposed to European armies (p.&amp;nbsp;207). Thus, they turn their full capacity to internal control, so that the objective is not to control territory but populations. Second, Tilly writes that the Cold War has led to a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to arm, fund and control developing countries, especially their militaries. Thus, military groups thrived as other organizations withered. Progressively, the military was better able to control the state, whereas civilian organizations could not rival its strength. In other words, Tilly argues that the military groups that run contemporary developing states have little in common with their European counterparts.

He further proposes three hypothesis to start to theorize the lack of civilianization in developing countries (p.&amp;nbsp;220):
# Failure of civilian institutions that lead to military intervention;
# Disproportionate external support for the military;
# No institutional tool to bargain and contain the military since it is artificially funded externally.
Tilly's main claim is thus that the European nation-state as it was constructed is certainly not a ''de facto'' endgame, or ideal polity model. In fact, Tilly argues that it is improbable that current Third World states follow exactly the same processus of state building- and we should not expect them to do so.

=== Academic discussion ===

==== Tarrow, 2008 ====
American sociologist [[Sidney Tarrow]] discussed the book during a 2008 conference organized by the [[Social Science Research Council]] in honor of Charles Tilly. During his talk, he addressed what he saw as four gaps in the book:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''The scope conditions of Tilly's theory'''. War is seen by Tilly as the "prime mover of early modern European state-making, because its requisites led to processes of extraction, protection, production, and distribution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Tarrow wonders how that can explain non-European states and states that formed more recently, such as post-colonial states. There is a lot of literature on "correcting Tilly" on state-building in the [[North–South divide|global South]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x/abstract|title = Tilly Tally: War-Making and State-Making in the Contemporary Third World|last = Taylor|first = Brian D.|date = March 2008|journal = International Studies Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|last2 = Botea|first2 = Roxana|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The theory's internal validity'''. In the 1975 book ''The Formation of National States in Western Europe'', Tilly critiques [[Joseph Strayer]]'s model of state formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State|last = Strayer|first = Joesph R.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1970|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', "the successful cases looked remarkably like Strayer's model."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''There is no attention for the role of religion and capitalism in European state development''', while Tarrow argues "[w]e know how deeply Catholic/Protestant conflicts divided Europe in the [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Year's War]], and how the settlement of that conflict produced the European state system after the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]]." Concerning capitalism, Tarrow said that "not all European states were equally in need of domestic capital to finance their wars", referring to Sweden under King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]. 
# '''The role of rights in state development in the United States''', characterized by the so-called "[[War on Terrorism – Timeline|War on Terror]]". According to Tarrow, Tilly "saw his country at risk of abandoning its devotion to its regime of rights."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Leander, 2012 ====
French/Swedish sociologist [[Anna Leander]] examined Tilly's relevance twenty years later in her article ''Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World''. Leander argues that the "war makes states"  no longer holds for four reasons:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/338105247.pdf|title = Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World|last = Leander|first = Anna|date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[State-building]]'''. While rulers' competition for controlling coercion is a crucial element of Tilly's hypothesis, today's rulers "take increasingly minor roles in the organization of coercion".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; State-building is not a product of interstate conflict anymore but rather of diplomacy and high-politics.
# '''Privatization of coercion'''. Another crucial element - the rulers' monopoly on legitimate violence - is disappearing. Europe and North America have seen a growth of 10 per cent per years in private security companies taking over the state prerogatives since the 1970s, a ''[[Peace Research Institute Frankfurt]]'' report shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence|url = http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?id=113632|website = www.isn.ethz.ch|access-date = 2016-01-25|first = ISN|last = Editors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Privatization of capital'''. Just like coercion, controlling capital is a crucial element in Tilly's hypothesis, as wars are expensive. However, national economics is a function of international economics and subject to international norms, rules, and regulations in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# '''Different interest groups'''. Tilly concludes that the civilianization of government evolved through the bargaining between rulers and their citizens. However, "the privatization of coercion and capital and the decentralization of political power has left rulers as brokers between different [...] interest groups rather than ''ruling them'' from a national center".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== 1992 Edition ==
A revised edition of the book was published in 1992 with the title ''Coercion, Capital, and European States AD 990-1992''. For that edition, Tilly made minor revisions throughout the book and added an extra section discussing the rapid changes in Central and Eastern Europe after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979''' was the fifth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. 39 countries attended the meeting. It was held in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], between 1 August 1979 and 7 August 1979, and was hosted by that country's [[President of Zambia|President]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]].

Issues discussed at the conference included the situation in Rhodesia, the armed conflicts in Indo-China, the global growth of the refugee problem, the situation in Cyprus and Southern Africa. Mr Shridath Ramphal was re-appointed as Commonwealth Secretary-General during the meeting. The [[Lusaka Declaration]] of the Commonwealth on Racism and Racial Prejudice was issued at the end of the CHOGM, including a special declaration condemning apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Derek|title=Lusaka 1979: A Significant Commonwealth Meeting|journal=The Round Table|date=October 1979|issue=276|pages=275–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Commonwealth Secretariat|title=Commonwealth Heads of Government.

'''Cosmopolitanism''' is the [[ideology]] that all [[human being]]s belong to a single [[community]], based on a shared morality. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a '''cosmopolitan''' or '''cosmopolite'''.

A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive [[morality]], a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. In a cosmopolitan community individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships of mutual respect. As an example, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing [[Belief|beliefs]] (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Anthony Appiah |first1 = Kwame
 |year = 1997
 |title = Cosmopolitan Patriots
 |url = |journal = Critical Inquiry
 |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |pages = 617–39
 |doi=10.1086/448846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various cities and locales, past or present, have been or are identified as "cosmopolitan"; that does not necessarily mean that all or most of their inhabitants consciously embrace the above philosophy.  Rather, locales may be called "cosmopolitan" simply because people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious background live in proximity and interact with each other.

In origin, cosmopolitanism suggests the establishment of a cosmo [[polis]] or ‘[[world state]]’ that would embrace all humanity.  Cosmopolitanism has come to stand for peace and harmony among nations, founded upon understanding, tolerance and interdependence.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the {{lang-grc|κοσμοπολίτης}}, or ''kosmopolitês'', formed from "{{lang|grc|κόσμος}}", ''[[cosmos|kosmos]]'', i.e. "world", "universe", or "cosmos", and {{lang|grc|πολίτης}}, "''politês''", i.e. "citizen" or "[one] of a city". Contemporary usage defines the term as "citizen of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kosmopoli/ths|κοσμοπολίτης|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cosmopolitan|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cosmopolitan&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}} {{cite web|title=cosmopolite|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cosmopolite&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Definitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the Greek etymology of "citizen of the world". However, as Appiah points out, "world" in the original sense meant "cosmos" or "universe", not earth or globe as current use assumes.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'', W.W. Norton, New York, 2006, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; One definition that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality. &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite Article = Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global | url= https://www.academia.edu/7547819/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._4_Political_Philosophies_of_the_Global_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Philosophical==
{{further|Global justice|Moral universalism}}

===Philosophical roots===
[[File:Waterhouse-Diogenes.jpg|thumb|Diogenes]]
Cosmopolitanism can be traced back to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] movement in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|The Lives of Eminent Philosophers]]'', Book VI, passage 63; online text [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=D.+L.+6.2.63&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0257 in Greek] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D2 in English] at the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, the broadest basis of social identity in at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The Stoics, who later took Diogenes' idea and developed it, typically stressed that each human being "dwells [...] in two communities&amp;nbsp;– the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. (1997). Kant and Stoic Cosmopolitanism, in The ''Journal of Political Philosophy'' Volume 5, Nr 1, pp. 1–25&lt;/ref&gt;
A common way to understand [[Stoicism|Stoic]] cosmopolitanism is through [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]]' circle model of identity that states that we should regard ourselves as concentric circles, the first one around the self, next immediate family, extended family, local group, citizens, countrymen, humanity. Within these circles human beings feel a sense of "affinity" or "endearment" towards others, which the Stoics termed [[Oikeiôsis]]. The task of world citizens becomes then to "draw the circles somehow towards the centre, making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers, and so forth".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Modern cosmopolitan thinkers===
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Immanuel Kant]], who argued for a ''ius cosmopoliticum'']]
In his 1795 essay ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] stages a ''ius cosmopoliticum'' (cosmopolitan law/right) as a guiding principle to protect people from war, and morally grounds this cosmopolitan right by the principle of universal hospitality. Kant there claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" (see [[common heritage of humanity]]) would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. 'Toward Perpetual Peace' in Practical Philosophy – Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Gregor MJ (trans.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1999. p329 (8:358).&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical concepts of [[Emmanuel Levinas]], on ethics, and [[Jacques Derrida]], on hospitality, provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes. For Levinas, the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the Other. In Being for the Other, he writes that there is no "universal moral law," only the sense of responsibility (goodness, mercy, charity) that the Other, in a state of vulnerability, calls forth.  The proximity of the Other is an important part of Levinas's concept: the face of the Other is what compels the response.

For Derrida, the foundation of ethics is hospitality, the readiness and the inclination to welcome the Other into one's home. Ethics, he claims, is hospitality. Pure, unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others. Levinas's and Derrida's theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the Other as different but of equal standing. Isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world, therefore, it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions, and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others: what conditions of hospitality to impose, and whether or not we have responded to the call of the Other. Further, both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the Other and others, and what is at stake.

Derrida in an interview with Bennington (1997) summarized "cosmopolitanism",&lt;ref name=Bennington1997&gt;

{{Quote
| text  = There is a tradition of cosmopolitanism, and if we had time we could study this tradition, which comes to us from, on the one hand, Greek thought with the Stoics, who have a concept of the 'citizen of the world'. You also have St. Paul in the Christian tradition, also a certain call for a citizen of the world as, precisely, a brother. St. Paul says that we are all brothers, that is sons of God, so we are not foreigners, we belong to the world as citizens of the world; and it is this tradition that we could follow up until Kant for instance, in whose concept of cosmopolitanism we find the conditions for hospitality. But in the concept of the cosmopolitical in Kant there are a number of conditions: first of all you should, of course, welcome the stranger, the foreigner, to the extent that he is a citizen of another country, that you grant him the right to visit and not to stay, and there are a number of other conditions that I can't summarise here quickly, but this concept of the cosmopolitical which is very novel, very worthy of respect (and I think cosmopolitanism is a very good thing), is a very limited concept. (Derrida cited in Bennington 1997).

}}

A further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the [[Second World War]].  As a reaction to the [[Holocaust]] and the other massacres, the concept of [[crimes against humanity]] became a generally accepted category in international law. This clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Ulrich (2006). The Cosmopolitan Vision, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical cosmopolitans are [[Moral universalism|moral universalists]]: they believe that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, come under the same moral standards. The boundaries between nations, states, cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant. A widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Appiah, Kwame Anthony (2006), Cosmopolitanism. Ethics in a World of Strangers, London: Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today's unique historical moment, an emerging [[planetary phase of civilization]], creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as [[global citizen]]s and possible formation of a [[global citizens movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 GTI Paper Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182551/http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 |date=2008-02-11 }} see ''[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/PDFFINALS/15Movements.pdf Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement]'', paper #15, and ''[[Global politics|Global Politics]] and Institutions'', paper #3&lt;/ref&gt; These emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications; [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space; the emergence of [[global warming]] and other ecological threats to our collective existence; new global institutions such as the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], or [[International Criminal Court]]; the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic [[globalization]]; the emergence of global [[NGO]]s and [[Transnationalism|transnational]] social movements, such as the [[World Social Forum]]; and so on. [[Globalization]], a more common term, typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural, social, political, environmental, demographic, values and knowledge transitions taking place.

===Contemporary cosmopolitan thinkers===
{{Cleanup section|Numbers with no known meaning appear in several places|date=February 2012}}
A number of contemporary theorists propose, directly and indirectly, various ways of becoming or being a cosmopolitan individual.

[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] discusses what he calls "Interbeing" as a way of living one's life in relation to others; "Interbeing" might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism. Nhat Hanh's philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of [[Buddhist]] teachings, which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people, animals, plants, and minerals.&lt;ref name=NhatHanh1996/&gt;{{rp|88}} He further describes what he calls "Mindfulness Training of the Order of Interbeing" as being aware of sufferings created by, but not limited to, the following causes: fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others; indoctrination of narrow-minded beliefs; imposition of views; anger; and miscommunication.&lt;ref name=NhatHanh1996&gt;{{cite book |first=Thich |last=Nhất Hạnh |author-link=Thich Nhat Hanh |editor-last=Kotler |editor-first=Arnold |others=Illustrations by Mayumi Oda |title=Being Peace |orig-year=1987 |location=Berkeley |publisher=Parallax |date=1996 |oclc=36745774 |isbn=978-0-938077-97-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–95}} Understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others' suffering and the root causes of suffering. Therefore, to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering, which then leads to compassion. It is through this process that others can be recognized as people.

Other theorists, philosophers, and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence. In ''[[Scared Sacred]]'', [[Velcrow Ripper]] takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Ripper, Velcrow (director) |title=Scared Sacred |medium=Film |publisher=National Filmboard of Canada |date=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Planet", [[Paul Gilroy]] explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what [[Judith Butler]] calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise.

In ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'', [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] notices something important about how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, "at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion" for valuing others?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |location=New York |publisher=Verso |date=2004 |oclc=803802111 |isbn=978-1-84467-005-5 |page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that "methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment."&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;{{rp|67}} This estrangement entails a "process of exposure to otherness" in order to foster "the irreducible value of diversity within sameness."&lt;ref name="Gilroy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilroy |first=Paul |chapter=The Planet |title=After Empire: Multiculture or Postcolonial Melancholia |location=London |publisher=Routledge |date=2004 |oclc=56454095 |isbn=978-0-415-34307-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Estrangement, therefore, could lead to de-emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness.

For Gilroy, being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social, ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise. In "The Planet", Gilroy describes the cases of [[Tom Hurndall]] and [[Rachel Corrie]];&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} each seems to exemplify what might be considered Gilroy's figure of the cosmopolitan. Both Hurndall and Corrie removed themselves (geographically) from their home cultures, presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories. Hurndall and Corrie were both killed in 2003 (in separate incidents) and their stories might serve as affirmations of familiarity, rather than models of estrangement. Gilroy’s model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples; this might be construed as a failure of Gilroy’s theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar.&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;

[[The Venus Project]], an international, multidisciplinary educational organization created by [[Jacque Fresco]], works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding our interdependence with nature and each other.

Some forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Frantz Fanon]], in ''The Wretched of the Earth'', observes that when nations achieved independence from European colonizers, frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future, and they became "manager[s] for Western enterprise...in practise set[ting] up its country as the brothel of Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fanon |first=Frantz |author-link=Frantz Fanon |date=1963 |chapter=The Pitfalls of National Consciousness |title=The Wretched of the Earth |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |translator-first=Constance |translator-last=Farrington |pages=148–205 |oclc=817260777 |isbn=978-0-8021-5083-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}} When "third world" nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital, ostensibly to improve their national quality of life, often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well-placed individuals and not the nation itself.

Further, Mahmood Mamdani in ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim'' suggests that the imposition of Western cultural norms, democracy and [[Christianity]] to name only two, has historically resulted in nationalist violence;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mamdani |first=Mahmood |title=Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |date=2004 |oclc=53315228 |isbn=978-0-375-42285-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Appiah has implied that democracy is a pre-requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appiah |first=Kwame Anthony |author-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |chapter=Kindness to Strangers |title=Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=W.

Much of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken [[nationalism]] and the framework of the sovereign [[nation-state]] for granted. Now, with the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication, some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation-state has become obsolete and that it  is time to design a better and more efficient alternative. [[Jesús Mosterín]] analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mosterín |first=Jesús |author-link=Jesús Mosterín |date=2008 |title=La cultura de la libertad |location=Madrid |publisher=Espasa-Calpe |isbn=978-84-670-2697-9 |oclc=693823808 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church, or the party. From this point of view, the [[Internet]] provides a much more attractive model than the nation-state. Neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people, ideas, or goods.  Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without sovereign nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mosterín |first=Jesús |author-link=Jesús Mosterín |date=2005 |title=A World without Nation States |journal=Acta Institutionis Philosophiae et Aestheticae |volume=23 |pages=55–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasizes the difference between international institutions, led by representatives of the national governments, and world or universal institutions, with clearly defined aims served by directors selected by their personal qualifications, independently of any national bias or proportion.

Criticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism, [[Charles Blattberg]] has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be "rooted," by which he means based upon a "global patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blattberg |first=Charles |date=5 April 2012 |editor1-last=Kymlicka |editor1-first=Will |editor2-last=Walker |editor2-first=Kathryn |ssrn=2034932 |chapter=We Are All Compatriots |title=Rooted Cosmopolitanism |location=Vancouver |publisher=UBC Press |via=Social Science Research Network |isbn=978-0-7748-2262-6 |oclc=886376838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available. Carol Nicholson compares the [[John Searle]]'s opposition to multiculturalism with [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s celebration of it. She uses [[Richard Rorty]] as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism, but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against Searle and in favor of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nicholson |first=Carol |date=1998 |title=Three Views of Philosophy and Multiculturalism: Searle, Rorty, and Taylor |conference=Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy |url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Educ/EducNich.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a conference on "Philosophy in a Multicultural Context", Rasmus Winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism.  He develops [[Bruno Latour]]'s conception of the philosopher as public diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Winther |first=Rasmus Grønfeldt |date=2012 |title=Free to Universalize or Bound by Culture?

==Political and sociological==

[[Emile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) observed the development of what he called the 'cult of the individual', which is a new religion that replaced the Christianity that was dying out, and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity. This new religion would provide the new foundations of Western society, and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation's constitutions. A society's sacred object would be the individual's human dignity, and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country's way of interpreting human dignity and human rights. Thus, rather than finding solidarity through national culture, or a particular traditional religious doctrine, society would be unified by its adherence to political values, i.e. individual rights and a defence of human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile. "Individualism and Individuals": Originally published as "L'individualisme et les intellectuels," Revue bleue, 4e serie, 10 (1898): 7-13. Translated by Mark Traugott. Article accessed: https://www.scribd.com/document/85771137/Durkheim-Individualism-and-the-Intellectuals&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's cult of the individual has many similarities to [[John Rawls]]' [[political liberalism]], which Rawls developed almost a century after Durkheim.&lt;ref&gt;See Cladis, Mark. 'A Communitarian Defense of Liberalism: Emile Durkheim and Contemporary Social Theory' (Stanford University Press: Stanford, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ulrich Beck]] (May 15, 1944 – January 1, 2015) was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional [[nation-state]] politics.  Nation-state theory sees power relations only among different state actors, and excludes a global economy, or subjugates it to the [[nation-state]] model.  Cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta-power game in which global capital, states and civil society are its players.

It is important to mark a distinction between Beck's cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state. For Beck, imposing a single world order was considered [[hegemony|hegemonic]] at best and [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] at worst.  Rather, political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations:
* "Acknowledging the otherness of those who are culturally different"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of the future"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of nature"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of the object"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of other rationalities"

A number of philosophers, including [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have introduced the concept of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]". For Levinas, the Other is given context in ethics and responsibility; we should think of the Other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves. According to Levinas, our initial interactions with the Other occur before we form a will—the ability to make choices. The Other addresses us and we respond: even the absence of response is a response. We are thus conditioned by the Other's address and begin to form culture and identity. After the formation of the will, we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and, as a result, continue the process of forming identity.&lt;ref name="Levinas"&gt;Emmanuel Levinas. Totality and Infinity. An Essay on Exteriority. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;

During this process, it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with Others. Even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction, we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves. Our dependence on the Other for the continuous formation of language, culture, and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us. Also once we've formed a will, it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence. When we have gained the capacity for recognition, the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the Other in [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Levinas"/&gt;

Cosmopolitanism shares some aspects of [[Moral universalism|universalism]] – namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law. However, the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stojadinović|first1=Mladen|title=UNIVERSALISM REVIVED: NEEDS-BASED COSMOPOLITANISM AS A FOUNDATION OF GLOBAL DEMOCRACY|journal=Facta Universitatis, Series: Philosophy, Sociology, Psychology and History|date=2014|volume=13|pages=78–80|url=http://casopisi.junis.ni.ac.rs/index.php/FUPhilSocPsyHist/article/view/331/333|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development. Human dignity, however, is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable. Under cosmopolitanism, all humans have rights; however, history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

As an example, [[Judith Butler]] discusses a Western discourse of "human" in ''Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence''. Butler works through the idea of "human" and notes that "human" has been "naturalized in its 'Western' mold by the contemporary workings of humanism" (32). Thus, there is the idea that not all "human" lives will be supported in the same way, indeed, that some human lives are worth more protection than others. Others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan, present the world-over with varying identities in different places.&lt;ref name="Barua Circulating"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barua, Maan |year=2013 |title=Circulating Elephants: Unpacking the Geographies of a Cosmopolitan Animal |journal= Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers |volume=0 |issue= |url=https://www.academia.edu/5089770|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is reiterated in [[Sunera Thobani]]'s "Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada," where she discusses a discourse in which [[Muslim people]] fall into a good/bad dichotomy: a "good Muslim" is one who has been Westernized and a "bad Muslim" is one who visibly rejects Western cultural influences. Thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized. Individuals who embrace Western ideals are considered fully "human" and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non-Westernized [[Cultural identity|cultural identities]].

According to those who follow Beck's reasoning, a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states, which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents. States would also utilize the power of [[civil society]] actors such as Non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Other authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today's conception of nation-states. These scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity of [[Global Citizen]] will take hold, diminishing the importance of national identities. The formation of a [[global citizens movement]] would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions, creating the space for global political discourse and decisions, would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level. Nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility (i.e., the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level, such as [[global warming]]) and [[subsidiarity]] (i.e., the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible) would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 GTI Paper Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182551/http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 |date=2008-02-11 }} see ''[[Global politics|Global Politics]] and Institutions'', paper #3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniele Archibugi]] proposes a renewed model for [[Global Citizen|global citizenship]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html   The Global Commonwealth of Citizens: Toward a Cosmopolitan Democracy], Princeton University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; institutional cosmopolitanism. It advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life. A number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible. Cosmopolitan democracy, for example, suggests strengthening the United Nations and other international organizations by creating a World Parliamentary Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], Debating Cosmopolitics, London: Verso, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cosmopolitanism" became a rhetorical weapon used by nationalists against "alien" ideas that went counter to orthodoxy.

The '''Tribunal de Cuentas''' ('''Court of Auditors''') is the supreme [[governmental accounting]] body of [[Spain]] responsible of the comptrolling of the public accounts and the auditing of the accountancy of the political parties, in accordance with the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]] and its [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Law]].

The Court of Auditors is composed by the President and 12 counsellors. The Counsellors are appointed by the [[Cortes Generales]], six of them by the [[Congress of Deputies|Congress]] and the other six by the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]]. To be appointed Counsellor of the Court it is needed to be a person with knowledge in audit, judge, prosecutor, university teacher or a public servant in an office that requieres superior studies, lawyer, economist or trade profesor, all of them with recognized experience and with fifteen years of professional activity. The Court Account Counselors are independent and irremovable. Their term is 9 years.&lt;ref name =LO82&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1982-11584|title=Organic Law 2/1982, of May 12, of the Court of Auditors.|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The very first origins of the Court they go back to the Reign of [[John II of Castile]]. [[Álvaro de Luna]], [[Constable of Castile]], advise the King to approve a royal order to make easy the tax collection due to the difficulties in the collection of taxes and in the ordering of the accounts. This royal order is approved in July 2, 1437 which regulated the Senior Accountants, a group of civil servants in charge of resolve economic conflicts and to reclame the money that was not paid in time.

During the reign of [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]], new ordinances were granted on January 9, 1478, to put an end to the backlog of outstanding accounts since 1454, in the [[Crown of Castile]]. The Accountancy has the exclusive and absolute authority to claim, censor and fail all the accounts of the public officials that handle flows and effects. The Senior Accountants are given the responsibility of reviewing them, those taken and completed, as well as determining and judging the scope of accounts. They are also authorized to proceed against any person or Council, and allow them to act on behalf of the Kings.

In the last years of the reign of [[King Charles I of Spain|King Charles I]], on July 10, 1554, new royal orders were granted in Valladolid for the Senior Accountants. They increase the number of accountants and the amount of the Room's right (it was a duty of the citizents of give a room to the King's servants during their stay in town). It is also the first time that it is included in a judicial process of accounts, when accounts considered extraordinary, or with some amendment, the obligation to take an oath to the people who have had them in charge, about the veracity of the confused data.

In the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], the Senior Accountants are helped by lawyers that advise them and the Treasury Council is created. In 1593, a new reform in the accounting system provokes that the King's Council lose its powers in accounting and these are given to the Council of the Treasury and incompatibilities are created for the Senior Accountants, that cannot have another job at the same time.

In 1605 were created the Court of Auditors of the Indies in [[Mexico]], [[Bogotá]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] to control the accounts of the spanish territories in Americas.

The [[Constitution of 1812]], passed by the Cortes of Cadiz, provided for the creation of an Accounting Office"to examine all accounts of public funds". In 1828, the ordinance establishing the Highest Court of Auditors was approved, which was in force until 1851.  In 1828, the ordinance establishing the Highest Court of Auditors was approved, which was in force until 1851.

During the regime established in the Constitution of 1845, a series of major reforms were carried out in the financial administration of the State and the Organic Act of the Court of Auditors, 1851 was approved, which is the seed of the current institution, with responsibility for the financial control of Public Administration.

In 1870, a new Law on Organization of the Court of Auditors of the Kingdom was approved and was in force until the Supreme Court of the Treasury was established in 1924, which integrated both external and internal control functions of the public sector.

The Court of Auditors of the Republic was established in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Constitution of 1931]] as the supreme audit body of the economic and management in the public sector and its Organic Act was approved in 1934.

Rules for adapting the institution to the political regime in force became established later. A Law on Organization, Functions and Procedures of the Court of Auditors of the Kingdom was approved in 1953, amended in 1961, in which the Court of Auditors was defined as the supreme external audit body of the State, with the function of reporting to the Head of State and the courts of the result of its audit activity and the recognition of a genuine judicial function.

The current Court of Auditors is configured at present by the [[Spanish constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]] as the supreme audit body of the economic and management in the public sector, which is independent from the executive power and is directly linked to the Spanish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.tcu.es/export/sites/default/.content/pdf/LA-INSTITUCION-Y-SUS-ANTECEDENTES.pdf|title=The Institution and its background|last=|first=|publisher=Tribunal de Cuentas|year=|isbn=|location=Spain|pages=2-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Court of Auditors is formed by the President, the Plenary, the Management Board, the Audit Section, the Prosecution Section, the Audit Counsellors, the Court of Auditors Prosecutor's Office and the General Secretariat.&lt;ref name =LO82/&gt;

{{Governance}}
{{POV|date=October 2015}}
{{Politics sidebar |expanded=none}}
'''Electronic governance''' or '''e-governance''' is the application of [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) for delivering [[government services]], exchange of information, communication transactions, integration of various stand-alone systems and services between government-to-citizen (G2C), government-to-business (G2B), government-to-government (G2G), government-to-employees (G2E) as well as [[back office|back-office]] processes and interactions within the entire government framework.&lt;ref name="Saugat, Masud"&gt;Saugata, B., and Masud, R.R. (2007). ''Implementing E-Governance Using OECD Model(Modified) and Gartner Model (Modified) Upon Agriculture of Bangladesh''. IEEE. 1-4244-1551-9/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Through e-governance, government services are made available to citizens in a convenient, efficient, and transparent manner. The three main target groups that can be distinguished in governance concepts are government, citizens, and
businesses/interest groups. In e-governance, there are no distinct boundaries.&lt;ref name=Garson&gt;Garson, D.G. (2006). ''Public Information Technology and E-Governance''. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction from e-government ==
{{Main|E-government}}

Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, there is a difference between e-governance and e-government. E-government refers to the use of the ICTs in public administration which, when combined with organizational change and new skills, are intended to improve [[public services]] and democratic processes and to strengthen support to the public. However, e-government has no provision for governance of ICTs. The governance of ICTs typically requires a substantial increase in regulation and [[Policy making|policy-making]]  capabilities, as well as additional expertise and opinion-shaping processes among various social stakeholders. The perspective of e-governance is "the use of the technologies that both help to govern and have to be governed".&lt;ref&gt;Rossel, Pierre, and Matthias Finger. "Conceptualizing e-Governance." Management (2007) : 399–407.&lt;/ref&gt; The central goal of e-governance is to reach the [[beneficiary]] and to ensure that their service needs are met. Ideally, the government will automatically recognize the importance of achieving this goal in order to maximize its efficiency.

Furthermore, e-government uses one-way [[communication protocol]] whereas e-governance uses two-way communication protocol. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Establishing the identity of the end [[beneficiary]] is a challenge in all citizen-centric services. Statistical information published by governments and global bodies do not always reveal the facts. The best form of e-governance cuts down on the unwanted interference of too many layers while delivering governmental services. It depends on good infrastructural setup with the support of local processes and parameters for governments to reach their citizens or end beneficiaries. A [[budget]] for planning, development, and growth can be derived from well laid out e-governance systems.

The relevance of BI Analytics has brought forth a paradigm shift in assimilating and visualizing huge chunks of data in near real-time manner. The pivot of all good decision-making systems is correct, up-to-date and compliant data. Governments not only want the transformation of their own country and countrymen but also expect improved relations and healthy trade across the world. Development should be transformative and continuously evolving. Internal as well as external IT systems should work in tandem with government policies and procedures. Data Analytics has the ability to change the color and complexion of the world. E-governance should induce up-to-date information, initiate effective interaction, and engage with transparent transactions in compliance with rule of law, thus enabling a sustainable transformation model.

The [[public–private partnership]] (PPP)-based e-governance projects are hugely successful in [[India]]. Many countries implement e-government policy in an attempt to build a [[Corruption (political)|corruption]]-free government.

== Government to citizen ==
The goal of government-to-citizen (G2C) e-governance is to offer a variety of ICT services to citizens in an efficient and economical manner and to strengthen the relationship between government and citizens using technology.

There are several methods of government-to-customer e-governance. [[Two-way communication]] allows citizens to instant message directly with public administrators, and cast remote electronic votes ([[electronic voting]]) and instant opinion voting. Transactions such as payment of services, such as city utilities, can be completed online or over the phone. Mundane services such as name or address changes, applying for services or grants, or transferring existing services are more convenient and no longer have to be completed face to face.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, W &amp; Walling, J, (2013). "Government in the twenty-first century: New Avenues of Study". Taking Sides. New York, NY: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By country===
G2C e-governance is unbalanced across the globe as not everyone has Internet access and computing skills, but the [[United States]], [[European Union]], and [[Asia]] are ranked the top three in development.

The [[Federal Government of the United States]] has a broad framework of G2C technology to enhance citizen access to Government information and services. [[Benefits.Gov|benefits.gov]] is an official US government website that informs citizens of benefits they are eligible for and provides information on how to apply for assistance. US State Governments also engage in G2C interaction through the [[Department of Transportation]], [[Department of Public Safety]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[United States Department of Education]], and others.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, (2004). "Communications of the ACM". Association for Computing Machinery.&lt;/ref&gt; As with e-governance on the global level, G2C services vary from state to state. The Digital States Survey ranks states on social measures, [[digital democracy]], [[e-commerce]], taxation, and revenue. The 2012 report shows [[Michigan]] and [[Utah]] in the lead and [[Florida]] and [[Idaho]] with the lowest scores.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Municipal governments in the United States also use government-to-customer technology to complete transactions and inform the public. Much like states, cities are awarded for innovative technology. Government Technology's "Best of the Web 2012" named Louisville, KY, Arvada, CO, Raleigh, NC, Riverside, CA, and Austin, TX the top five G2C city portals.&lt;ref name=Best&gt;Best of the Web, (2012). Government Technologies. http://www.govtech.com/e-government/2012-Best-of-the-Web-Award-Winners-Announced.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

European countries were ranked second among all geographic regions. The Single Point of Access for Citizens of Europe supports travel within Europe and Europe is a 1999 initiative supporting an online government. Main focuses are to provide public information, allow customers to have access to basic [[public service]]s, simplify online procedures, and promote [[electronic signature]]s.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;  [[Estonia]] is the first and the only country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171019-could-estonia-be-the-first-digital-country|title=Could Estonia be the first ‘digital’ country?|last=Lufkin|first=Bryan|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the world with e-residency&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=e-Residency of Estonia|date=2018-10-29|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-Residency_of_Estonia&amp;oldid=866269903|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enables anyone in the world outside Estonia to  access Estonian online services. 

Asia is ranked third in comparison, and there are diverse G2C programs between countries. [[Singapore]]'s eCitizen Portal is an organized single access point to government information and services. [[South Korea]]'s Home Tax Service (HTS) provides citizens with 24/7 online services such as tax declaration. [[Taiwan]] has top ranking G2C technology including an online motor vehicle services system, which provides 21 applications and payment services to citizens.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

Government-to-Citizen is the communication link between a government and private individuals or residents. Such G2C communication most often refers to that which takes place through [[Information and Communication Technologies]] (ICTs), but can also include [[direct mail]] and media campaigns. G2C can take place at the federal, state, and local levels. 
G2C stands in contrast to G2B, or [[Government-to-business|Government-to-Business]] networks.

One such Federal G2C network is [[USA.gov]], the United States' official web portal, though there are many other examples from governments around the world.&lt;ref&gt;White, Jay D. (2007) Managing Information in the Public Sector. M.E. Sharpe. New York&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns ===
A full switch to government-to-citizen e-governance will cost a large amount of money in development and implementation.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In addition, government agencies do not always engage citizens in the development of their e-gov services or accept feedback. Customers identified the following barriers to government-to-customer e-governance: not everyone has Internet access, especially in rural or low-income areas, G2C technology can be problematic for citizens who lack computing skills. Some G2C sites have technology requirements (such as browser requirements and plug-ins) that won't allow access to certain services, language barriers, the necessity for an e-mail address to access certain services, and a lack of privacy.&lt;ref name=Bertot&gt;Bertot, Jaegar, and McClure, (2008). "Citizen Centered E-Government Services: Benefits, Costs, and Research Needs". Montreal, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government to employees==
{{redirect|G2E|gaming trade show|Global Gaming Expo}}
E-governance to Employee partnership (G2E) Is one of four main primary interactions in the delivery model of E-governance. It is the relationship between online tools, sources, and articles that help employees maintain communication with the government and their own companies. E-governance relationship with Employees allows new learning technology in one simple place as the computer. Documents can now be stored and shared with other colleagues online.&lt;ref name=Fang&gt;Fang, Zhiyuan. "E-government in Digital Era: Concept, Development, and Practice." International Journal of the Computer 10.2 (2002): 1-22. Web. 2 Apr. 2014.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.133.9080&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
E-governance makes it possible for employees to become paperless and makes it easy for employees to send important documents back and forth to colleagues all over the world instead of having to print out these records or fax&lt;ref name=carter&gt;Carter, Lemuria, and France Belanger. "Citizen Adoption of Electronic Government Initiatives". IEEE Xplore. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Government-to-employees|G2E]] services also include software for maintaining personal information and records of employees. Some of the benefits of G2E expansion include:

* E-payroll – maintaining the online sources to view paychecks, pay stubs, pay bills, and keep records for tax information.
* E-benefits – be able to look up what benefits an employee is receiving and what benefits they have a right to.
* [[E-learning|E-training]] – allows for new and current employees to regularly maintain the training they have through the development of new technology and to allow new employees to train and learn over new materials in one convenient location. E-learning is another way to keep employees informed on the important materials they need to know through the use of visuals, animation, videos, etc. It is usually a computer-based learning tool, although not always. It is also a way for employees to learn at their own pace ([[distance learning]]), although it can be instructor-led.
* Maintaining records of personal information – Allows the system to keep all records in one easy location to update with every single bit of information that is relevant to a personal file. Examples being social security numbers, tax information, current address, and other information&lt;ref name=Dawes&gt;Dawes, Sharon S. "The Evolution and Continuing Challenges of E-Governance." - Dawes. Wiley Online Library, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government-to-employees (abbreviated G2E) is the online interactions through instantaneous communication tools between [[Government-owned corporation|government units]] and their employees. G2E is one out of the four primary delivery models of [[e-Government]].&lt;ref name="G2E"&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx = 10.1.1.127.9483|title=E-Government for Developing Countries:Opportunities and Challenges|publisher=The Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries (EJISDC)|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite news|first=B.S.|last=Raghavan|title=E-the-people|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2001/08/10/stories/041039of.htm|location=India| agency=[[The Hindu Group]] |newspaper=[[Business Line]]|date=10 August 2001|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=On demand government|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2001/08/10/stories/041039of.htm|location=London|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 November 2003|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G2E is an effective way to provide [[e-learning]] to the employees, bring them together and to promote knowledge sharing among them.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/_sec/e_government_plan/p41-43_appendixe.htm|title=U.S. Department of Labor E-Government Strategic Plan|publisher=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also gives employees the possibility of accessing information in regard to compensation and benefits policies, training and learning opportunities and civil rights laws.&lt;ref name="G2E"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Govern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erego.com/solutions/G2E.htm|title=Government to Employee|publisher=Eon Technologies|accessdate=2010-01-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411075339/http://www.erego.com/solutions/G2E.htm|archivedate=2010-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; G2E services also include software for maintaining personal information and records of employees.&lt;ref name="Govern"/&gt;

== Government to government ==

===E-government===
From the start of 1990s e-commerce and e-product, there has rampant integration of e-forms of government process. Governments have now tried to use the efficiencies of their techniques to cut down on waste. E-government is a fairly broad subject matter, but all relate to how the services and representation are now delivered and how they are now being implemented.

Many governments around the world have gradually turned to Information technologies (IT) in an effort to keep up with today's demands. Historically, many governments in this sphere have only been reactive, but recently there has been a more proactive approach in developing comparable services such things as [[e-commerce]] and [[e-business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1936-4490.2003.tb00306.x|title=E-Government and E-Governance: The Future Isn't What It Used to Be|journal=Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences / Revue Canadienne des Sciences de l'Administration|volume=20|pages=74|year=2009|last1=Marche|first1=Sunny|last2=McNiven|first2=James D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before, the structure emulated private-like business techniques. Recently that has all changed as e-government begins to make its own plan. Not only does e-government introduce a new form of record keeping, but it also continues to become more interactive to better the process of delivering services and promoting constituency participation.

The framework of such an organization is now expected to increase more than ever by becoming efficient and reducing the time it takes to complete an objective. Some examples include paying utilities, tickets, and applying for permits. So far, the biggest concern is accessibility to Internet technologies for the average citizen. In an effort to help, administrations are now trying to aid those who do not have the skills to fully participate in this new medium of governance, especially now as e-government progressing to more e-governance terms.

An overhaul of the structure is now required as every pre-existing sub-entity must now merge under one concept of e-government. As a result, Public Policy has also seen changes due to the emerging of constituent participation and the Internet. Many governments such as Canada's have begun to invest in developing new mediums of communication of issues and information through virtual communication and participation. In practice, this has led to several responses and adaptations by interest groups, activist, and lobbying groups. This new medium has changed the way the polis interacts with government.

===Editorial===
The purpose to include e-governance to government is to means more efficient in various aspects. Whether it means to reduce cost by reducing paper clutter, staffing cost, or communicating with private citizens or public government. E-government brings many advantages to play such as facilitating information delivery, application process/renewal between both business and private citizen, and participation with the constituency. There are both internal and external advantages to the emergence of IT in government, though not all municipalities are alike in size and participation.
 
In theory, there are currently 4 major levels of E-government in municipal governments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/0033-3352.00196|title=The Evolution of E-Government among Municipalities: Rhetoric or Reality?|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=62|issue=4|pages=424|year=2002|last1=Moon|first1=M. Jae}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The establishment of a secure and cooperative interaction among governmental agencies

* Two-way communication (request and response)
*Service and financial transactions
*Integration (horizontal and vertical integration)
*Political participation

The adoption of e-government in municipalities evokes greater innovation in e-governance by being specialized and localized. The level success and feedback depends greatly on the city size and government type. A [[council-manager government]] municipality typically works the best with this method, as opposed to [[mayor-council government]] positions, which tend to be more political. Therefore, they have greater barriers towards its application. Council-Manager governments are also more inclined to be effective here by bringing innovation and reinvention of governance to e-governance.

The International City/County Management Association and Public Technology Inc. have done surveys over the effectiveness of this method. The results are indicating that most governments are still in either the primary stages (1 or stage 2), which revolves around public service requests. Though application of integration is now accelerating, there has been little to no instigating research to see its progression as e-governance to the government. We can only theorize it's still within the primitive stages of e-governance.

===Overview===
Government-to-Government (abbreviated G2G) is the online non-commercial interaction between Government organizations, departments, and authorities and other Government organizations, departments, and authorities. Its use is common in the [[UK]], along with [[G2C]], the online non-commercial interaction of local and central Government and private individuals, and [[Government-to-business|G2B]] the online non-commercial interaction of local and central Government and the commercial business sector.

G2G systems generally come in one of two types: Internal-facing - joining up a single Governments departments, agencies, organizations, and authorities - examples include the integration aspect of the [http://www.gateway.gov.uk Government Gateway], and the UK [[NHS Connecting for Health]] [[National Programme for IT#The Spine .28including PDS .26 PSIS.29|Data SPINE]]. External facing - joining up multiple Governments IS systems - an example would include the integration aspect of the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS), developed to meet the requirements of the [[Schengen Agreement]].

===Objective===
The strategic objective of e-governance, or in this case G2G is to support and simplify governance for government, citizens, and businesses. The use of ICT can connect all parties and support processes and activities. Other objectives are to make government administration more transparent, speedy and accountable while addressing the society's needs and expectations through efficient public services and effective interaction between the people, businesses, and government.&lt;ref name="Oman Government"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oman|first1=ITA|title=eOman Portal|url=http://www.ita.gov.om/ITAPortal/Info/FAQ_eGovernmen.aspx#What_are_the_objectives_of_e-Governance|website=ita.gov.om |publisher=Governance of Oman|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of networking, the Government Secure Intranet (GSi) puts in place a secure link between central government departments. It is an IP-based [[virtual private network]] based on broadband technology introduced in April 1998 and further upgraded in February 2004. Among other things, it offers a variety of advanced services including file transfer and search facilities, directory services, email exchange facilities (both between network members and over the Internet) as well as voice and video services. An additional network is currently also under development: the Public Sector Network (PSN) will be the network to interconnect public authorities (including departments and agencies in England; devolved administrations and local governments) and facilitate in particular sharing of information and services among each other.&lt;ref&gt;HM Government (December 2009). "Putting the Frontline First: smarter government". Accessed 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government to business ==
{{redirect|G2B|the scientific journal|Genes, Brain and Behavior}}

Government-to-Business (G2B) is the [[online]] non-commercial interaction between local and central government and the commercial business sector with the purpose of providing businesses information and advice on [[e-business]] [[best practices]]. G2B: Refers to the conduction through the Internet between government agencies and trading companies. B2G: Professional transactions between the company and the district, city, or federal regulatory agencies. B2G usually include recommendations to complete the measurement and evaluation of books and contracts.

===Objective===
The objective of G2B is to reduce difficulties for business, provide immediate information and enable digital communication by e-business (XML). In addition, the government should re-use the data in the report proper, and take advantage of commercial electronic transaction protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/government-to-business-g2b/12391 IGI-GLOBAL What is Government-to-Business (G2B) Retrieved 27 OCT.2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Government services are concentrated on the following groups: human services; community services; judicial services; transport services; land resources; business services; financial 
services and other.&lt;ref&gt;Bakry, S. H. "Development of e-government: a STOPE view." International Journal of 
Network Management. 2004, 14(5), 339-350.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the components listed above for each cluster of related services to the enterprise.

===Benefits for business===

E-government reduces costs and lowers the barrier of allowing companies to interact with the government. The interaction between the government and businesses reduces the time required for businesses to conduct a transaction. For instance, there is no need to commute to a government agency's office, and transactions may be conducted online instantly with the click of a mouse. This significantly reduces transaction time for the government and businesses alike.

E-Government provides a greater amount of information that the business needed, also it makes that information more clear. A key factor in business success is the ability to planand forecast through data-driven future. The government collected a lot of economic, demographic and other trends in the data. This makes the data more accessible to companies which may increase the chance of economic prosperity.

In addition, E-Government can help businesses navigate through government regulations by providing an intuitive site organization with a wealth of useful applications. The electronic filings of applications for environmental permits give an example of it. Companies often do not know how, when, and what they must apply. Therefore, failure to comply with environmental regulations up to 70%, a staggering figure&lt;ref&gt;According to an Environmental Results Program (ERP) study conducted in 1997 covering 2,000 (of 16,000 total) businesses.&lt;/ref&gt; most likely due to confusion about the requirements, rather than the product of willful disregard of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-planning-and-collab/strat-planning/prev-plans/e-gov-strat-plan/section-2-the-benefits-of-e-government.html The Benefits of E-Government Retrieved 27 OCT.2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===

The government should concern that not all people are able to access the internet to gain online government services. The network reliability, as well as information on government bodies,  can influence public opinion and prejudice hidden agenda. There are many considerations and implementation, designing e-government, including the potential impact of government and citizens of disintermediation, the impact on economic, social and political factors, vulnerable to cyber attacks, and disturbances to the status quo in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Atkinson | first1 = Robert D. | last2 = Castro | first2 = Daniel | title = Digital Quality of Life | publisher = The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation | pages = 137–145 | year = 2008 | url=http://www.itif.org/files/DQOL-14.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G2B rises the connection between government and businesses. Once the e-government began to develop, become more sophisticated, people will be forced to interact with e-government in the larger area. This may result in a lack of privacy for businesses as their government gets their more and more information. In the worst case, there is so much information in the electron transfer between the government and business, a system which is like [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] could be developed. As the government can access more information, the loss of privacy could be a cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/48629.html?wlc=1235202183 |title=AT&amp;T Sued for Role in Aiding US Government Surveillance |publisher=TechNewsWorld |author=Lyman, Jay |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/08/analysis-new-la.html |title=Analysis: New Law Gives Government Six Months to Turn Internet and Phone Systems into Permanent Spying Architecture |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=Singel, Ryan |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
The main goal of government to business is to increase productivity by giving business more access to information in a more organize manner while lowering the cost of doing business as well as the ability to cut "red tape", save time, reduce operational cost and to create a more transparent business environment when dealing with government.

*Lowering cost of doing business – electronic transaction save time compared to conducting business in person.
*Cutting red tape – rules and regulation placed upon business normally take time and are most likely to cause a delay- in (G2B) will allow a much faster process with fewer delays and decreasing the number of rules and regulations
*Transparency – More information will be available, making G2B easier to communicate.

'''Government to business key points:'''

#Reduce the burden on business by adopting a process that enables collecting data once for multiple uses and streamlining redundant data.
#Key lines of business: regulations, economic development, trade, permits/licenses, grants/loans, and asset management.

'''Difference between G2B and B2G'''

*''Government to business (G2B)'' – Refers to the conducting of transactions between government bodies and business via the internet.
*''Business to the government (B2G)'' – Professional affairs conducted between companies and regional, municipal, or federal governing bodies. B2G typically encompasses the determination and evaluation of proposal and completion of the contract.

'''Conclusion:'''

The overall benefit of e-governance when dealing with business is that it enables the business to perform more efficiently.

==Challenges – international position==

E-governance is facing numerous challenges world over. These challenges are arising from administrative, legal, institutional and technological factors. The challenge includes security drawbacks such as spoofing, tampering, repudiation, disclosure, elevation of privilege, denial of service and other cyber crimes. Other sets of problems include implementation parts such as funding, management of change, privacy, authentication, delivery of services, standardization, technology issues and use of local languages.

'''Elite capture''' is a form of [[corruption]] whereby public resources are biased for the benefit of a few individuals of superior social status in detriment to the welfare of the larger population.  Elites are groups of individuals who, because of self-ratifying factors such as social class, asset ownership, religious affiliations, political power, historic discrimination among social groups, political party affiliation,  or economic position, have decision-making power in processes of public concern. This specific form of corruption occurs when elites use public funds, originally intended to be invested in services that benefit the larger population, to fund projects that would only benefit them. This differentiates elite capture from embezzlement, misappropriation or other diversion of funds by a public official. Elite capture is related to information asymmetry, inefficient regulation or inefficient allocation of resources because it causes a biased distribution of a public good or a service, resulting a situation wherein certain segments of the population experience reduced access to these public goods.  In this context, as long as there is elite capture, the welfare impact will not be Pareto Optimal nor equitable.

==Elite Capture in Decentralization==
For long it was thought that creating decentralized governments would avoid the limitations of a single planner in society. A centralized government often lacks knowledge and might be subject of intense lobbying, leaving certain territories unattended. On the other hand, theory predicts that when people are involved in governing and have representation in decision making, public spending is supposed to be more efficient, more equitable and more sustainable. However, despite the theoretical predictions, the outcomes of many development projects in decentralized governments have not met these expectations.
By yielding power to smaller units, money should be more efficiently distributed, but local governments are more vulnerable to pressure groups. Failure can occur when particular subgroups of the community are able to mobilize resources to further their own self-interest at the expense of the broader community. Local governments are even more vulnerable to capture by local elites than national governments.
Attempts to reduce elite capture in decentralized governments range from going back to a heavily centralized planner to providing citizens with funds to initiate projects. This last option has been criticized because the citizens’ ability and skills to actually implement programs may be weaker than that of local leaders.  
According to the World Bank, development assistance is vulnerable to manipulation or hijack by elites, independently of the form that the assistance may take, because such aid it requires governmental or private agency to ensure transfer to households. It is in this intermediary stage where instances of elite capture are most common. Be it centralized or decentralized government, there is a risk of ineffective public resource delivery involved, where part of the local population will receive more than the rest of the local population. This situation has welfare consequences. 

==Alternative solutions==
First, elite capture of public resources by local elites can be relatively lessened by the presence of media to balance the asymmetry of information. Empirical studies have shown that government responsiveness and accountability to ensure equal distribution of public goods and avoid elite capture is related to the availability of information and general levels of awareness among the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |work=Working Paper No. 2010/82 |title=Elite Capture or Capture Elites? Lessons from the ‘Counter-elite’ and ‘Co-opt-elite’ Approaches in Bangladesh and Ghana |first=Sam |last=Wong |date=July 2010 |url=https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/wp2010-82.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the ‘counter-elite’ approach to deal with elite capture advocates challenging elites by completely excluding them in the implementation of projects. It assumes that all elites are inherently bad. By raising public awareness of power inequalities and building local capacity, this approach suggests that community empowerment and political citizenship would be effective in resisting elite domination. This approach is not necessarily effective in challenging elite domination, due to structural dependence of poor people on elites and the weakening of established institutions. Third, the ‘co-opt-elite’ approach suggests that cooperation with elites, rather than confrontation, is the solution to alleviating poverty. It asserts that not all elites are bad, and some of them can play a constructive role in community development. It also assumes a pragmatic use of elites’ networks and resources can benefit poor communities.  The ‘counter-elite’ approach is not necessarily effective in eroding elite power, and also risks legitimizing the authority of the elites and worsening inequality.

'''Similar Concepts'''
Elite capture and discrimination are very similar concepts because both imply unequal power status and denial of public resources. Social discrimination can promote elite capture, but is not an interchangable concept. Elite capture is based on a state of an unequal power relations, whereas discrimination may or may not be the cause of an unequal distribution of power. Elite capture is a changing and dynamic process, and power structures change with it when a new elite arises. Discrimination is rather static in this sense. Elite capture is a manifested form of corruption, and social discrimination is a manifestation of a set of beliefs in a society. 
Elite capture and state capture are also similar because they are both related to deviation of public resources for private benefits, but differ in how power is exercised. Elite capture is carried out by an elite that is legitimately entitled some level of de jure power. State capture is carried out by elites that exercise de facto power (e.g. powerful unions or big multinational companies) that aim to have influence on the decision making process of the institutions. However, both phenomena are both symptommatic of and a main reason for bad governance because they promote a vicious cycle, with long-term effects on institutional and bureaucratic performance.

==Examples==
 
An example of elite capture in the United States is to be found in the literature on the subject of iron triangles, wherein special interests are able to achieve disproportionately favorable outcomes from  congressional committees and federal regulators. Oftentimes, personnel between each side of the iron triangle is interchangeable, a revolving door dynamic which is favorable to the development of capture of regulators by the entities they are supposed to oversee. 
Also, examples are found in most developing countries, where an increasing proportion of government and foreign aid is distributed through community driven development but fail to properly reach the target population. 
Additional examples are male-dominated cultures where women may be disproportionately influenced by elite capture, since they tend to be excluded from the social elect and public services.
It is a phenomenon that may even take place even where there is no clear indicators of ‘capture’ of power or corruption like access to education in rural areas of developing countries. While there are primary schools in the villages, they are somewhat dysfunctional due to lack of maintenance. As a result, children have to go to neighboring villages to study. Usually girls are not sent far away from their villages, limiting their study years. Therefore, girls are systematically denied access to a public resource (education) as opposed to boys in the same village. 
The absence of an enabling social, political and economic environment can also encourage unintended elite capture. But at the same time, corruption and inefficiency appear to be a concomitant part of the elite capture problem.
Academic Approaches
As many other activities related to corruption, there has been very few systematic attempts to measure and identify causes and consequences of this phenomenon in economy. The concept itself is still in constant evolution because majority of evidence comes from non-experimental case studies or empirical data sets and there is very little consensus on the outcomes. 
A formal representation of the level of elite capture can be done by considering a single public service and how much does the elite capture changes the per-capita enjoyment of if it was equitably distributed. The idea is to consider how different the average consumption level of a certain public program would be if the average formal elites were eliminated. Empirical studies often analyze total welfare and utility function of a society. The idea is to identifying utility function of all households in three scenarios: current unequal distribution situation, with probability of equitable distributions and unavailability the public service or good to finally compare the data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8602">'''Formative contexts''' are the institutional and imaginative arrangements that shape a society's conflicts and resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek, David M. 1990. "Programmatic Thought and the Critique of the Social Disciplines." In Critique and Construction, ed. M Perry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the [[Social structure|structures]] that limit both the practice and the imaginative possibilities in a socio-political order, and in doing so shape the routines of conflict over social, political and economic resources that govern access to labor, loyalty, and social station, e.g. government power, economic capital, technological expertise, etc. In a formative context, the institutions structure conflict over government power and capital allocation, whereas the imaginative framework shapes the preconceptions about possible forms of human interaction. Through this, a formative context further creates and sustains a set of roles and ranks, which mold conflict over the mastery of resources and the shaping of the ideas of social possibilities, identities and interests. The formative context of the [[liberal democracy|Western democracies]], for example, include the organization of production through managers and laborers, a set of laws administering capital, a state in relation to the citizen, and a social division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York|pages=58–59, 69–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Also referred to as order, framework, or structure of social life, the concept of formative context was developed by philosopher and social theorist [[Roberto Unger]]. Whereas other social and political philosophers have taken the historical context as a given, and seen one existing set of institutional arrangements as necessarily giving birth to another set, Unger rejects this naturalization of the world and moves to explain how such contexts are made and reproduced. The most forceful articulation and development of the concept is in Unger's book ''False Necessity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The thesis of formative context is central to Unger's theory of [[false necessity]], which rejects the idea of a closed number of institutional arrangements of human societies, e.g. feudalism and capitalism, and that these arrangements are the product of historical necessity, as theories of [[liberalism]] or [[Marxism]] claim. Rather, Unger argues that there are myriad institutional arrangements that can coalesce, and that they do so through a contingent process of struggle, reconciliation, and innovation among individuals and groups. For Unger, the concept of formative context serves to explain the basis of a certain set of institutional arrangements and their reliance upon each other. It offers an explanation of the cycles of reform and retrenchment of a socio-economic political system and how it remains undisturbed by rivalries and animosities. The theory of false necessity goes on to explain the connections of a formative context, their making and remaking, and how they maintain stability despite the contingent formation.&lt;ref&gt;For good overviews of Unger's thought see Collins, Hugh. “Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement,” Journal of Law and Society 14 (1987), Trubek, David M. "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 95, no. 2 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
While a formative context of a society exerts a major influence on the course of [[social actions]] and behaviors, it is itself hard to challenge, revise, or even identify in the midst of everyday conflicts and routines. Thus there are two criteria for determining if an institution or structure belongs in a formative context, one subjective and one objective. The '''subjective criteria''' considers the perspective of the social actors themselves and the arrangements that are assumed in their speech and actions. For example, the attempts of big business and labor to protect themselves through deals with each other, and the political efforts of unorganized labor and petty bourgeoisie to undermine and circumvent these deals by pressuring the government, operate on the same institutional assumption of the distinction between economy and polity, and that victory in one can be offset by the other. The '''objective criteria''' is simply that if a substitution of the proposed structure affects the hierarchies or cyclical conflicts—if it alters the social divisions—then it can be included in the formative context. For example, a change in any one of the following conditions would completely change the formative context of a Western democratic state: if the state stopped being democratic or was democratic enough to allow collective militancy and subject private centers of power to public accountability; if business could have its way and override all regulatory controls of govt; or if no workers could unionize or all of them could and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = Social Theory, Its Situation and Its Task | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1987 | page=63| isbn = 978-0-521-32974-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=61–66| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western democracies==
The formative context of the North Atlantic democracies can be organized into four clusters of institutional arrangements: work, law, government, and occupational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=69–82| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''work-organization complex''' makes a distinction in work between task definers and task executers, with the material rewards concentrated in the task defining jobs.
*The '''private-rights complex''' understands the rights of the individual vis-a-vis other individuals and the state. This structure is central to the allocation and control of capital, ensuring all forms of capital distribution and entitlement.
*The '''government-organization complex''' is the institutional arrangement to protect the individual from the state, and to prevent those in power from changing the formative context. It establishes a link between safeguards of freedom and the dispersion of powers, e.g. partisan rivalries fail to extend to debates over the fundamental institutions that affect social interactions.
*The '''occupational-structure complex''' is a social division of labor characterized by a lack of caste or religious division. It is based on material reward and task defining jobs receiving the highest pay.

==Influences in other fields==
The thesis of formative contexts has been heavily drawn on and used within the [[Social Study of Information Systems]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In the field of [[Information systems]] [[Claudio Ciborra]] and Giovan Lanzara define the term "formative context" as the "set of institutional arrangements and cognitive imageries that inform actors' practical and reasoning routines in organisations". They posit that the common inability to inquire into, challenge or shape formative context can inhibit individuals and organizations from acting competently and learning what they need to know in order to make the most of situations and technological transitions as the enchaining effect of Formative Context can lead to cognitive and social inertia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The '''Four-Stage Theory of the [[Republic of China]]''' or the '''Theory of the Four Stages of the Republic of China''' is a viewpoint proposed by [[Chen Shui-bian]], the [[President of the Republic of China|President of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]] from 2000 to 2008, in 2005. It is a viewpoint regarding the [[Political status of Taiwan|political status of the Republic of China]], whose government retreated to [[Taiwan]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. The main idea of the theory is that the time line for the development of the Republic of China can be classified into four stages, which are:

# The Republic of China '''''on''''' [[mainland China|the mainland]]. (Chinese: 中華民國在大陸, [[Republic of China (1912–49)]]) (1912–1949)
# The Republic of China '''''arrival to''''' Taiwan. (Chinese: 中華民國來臺灣) (before [[Lee Teng-hui]]'s presidency) (1949–1988)
# The [[Republic of China on Taiwan|Republic of China '''''on''''' Taiwan]]. (Chinese: 中華民國在臺灣) (during [[Lee Teng-hui]]'s presidency) (1988–2000)
# The Republic of China '''''is''''' Taiwan. (Chinese: 中華民國是臺灣) (during [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s presidency) (2000–2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mac.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=67794&amp;ctNode=6607&amp;mp=3 Mainland Policy and Work - August 2, 2005], [[Mainland Affairs Council]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taipei Times 1"&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2005/08/03/2003266196 Chen says name variance is simply an expedient], ''[[Taipei Times]]'', 2005/8/3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taipei Times 2"&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2005/08/14/2003267652 Chen urges unity to deal with China], ''[[Taipei Times]]'', 2005/8/3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illumination ==

By this [[theory]], Chen pointed out that the Republic of China was at the 4th stage after [[Taiwan presidential election, 2000|the first ruling party rotation of the central government in 2000]]. That is, Taiwan, with the official name called the "[[Republic of China]]", is already an independent sovereign state separate from [[People's Republic of China]]. This theory is welcomed by the mainstream of the [[Pan-Green coalition]] (led by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]) in Taiwan, which supports eventual ''de jure'' [[Taiwan independence]]; but is not welcomed by most members of the [[Pan-Blue coalition]] ([[Kuomintang]]), which supports the eventual [[Chinese reunification|reunification of Taiwan with mainland China]] as part of a single "[[Chinese nation]]". Some members of the more strongly pro-independence [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] also oppose this view since they deem the ROC to be an illegitimate foreign and colonial regime that should be replaced by the proposed "[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]". The Pan-Blue Coalition agrees with the first three stages, but disagrees with the fourth stage, and prefers to maintain the distinction between the "Republic of China" (the polity) and "Taiwan" (part of the territory the polity governs). The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] has also voiced opposition against the fourth stage on the grounds that such an interpretation is a step closer to ''de jure'' Taiwan independence. (Officially, the PRC claims the existence of the ROC only until 1949.)&lt;ref name="Taipei Times 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taipei Times 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBP"&gt;International Business Publications, USA, [https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=XghBi4moFK4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=zh-TW#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Position of the Republic of China (ROC)], ''Taiwan Country Study Guide: Strategic Information and Developments'', 2012/3/3, p45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Both the ''[[Free China Journal]]'' and the ''[[Taiwan Journal|Free China Weekly]]'' often referred to the polity as the "'''Republic of China on Taiwan'''" prior to [[Lee Teng-hui]] taking office as the first Taiwan-born President of the Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democracy's coming of age|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=4974|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 December 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Helping hands for reconstruction|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=5164|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 September 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Double Tenth of confidence|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=5532|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 November 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Month in Free China|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&amp;post=13829|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 June 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Documents|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=6159|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 August 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Lee's administration, the term remained in use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reaping Ideas And Criticism|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=4664|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Please call me Mr. Ching-kuo'|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=20,29,35,45&amp;post=25750|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perceptions And Realities|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=5460|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Redefining Social Order|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=12,29,33,45&amp;post=22524|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taiwan Review|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,8,29,31,32,45&amp;post=4580|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the term in his speech at [[Cornell University]], [[Ithaca]], [[New York State|New York]], United States in June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=13324&amp;ctNode=103 Text of Lee's Cornell address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030001106/http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=13324&amp;ctNode=103 |date=2016-10-30 }}, TAIWAN INFO, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1995-6-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.tvbs.com.tw/other/389500 國家定位　李前總統︰ROC在台灣], [[TVBS]], 2003/12/21&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to identify the [[Republic of China]] with its remaining major component &amp;ndash; the [[island of Taiwan]], as opposed to its decades-long claim to all China since losing the [[Chinese civil war|civil war]] in 1949. Prior to this speech, the government officials used "Republic of China" when the name of the state was used. Lee's usage is considered as a departure from the convention, as this usage can be interpreted in the sense that the Republic of China's sovereignty does not extend to [[mainland China]], which the People's Republic of China controls.&lt;ref name="IBP"/&gt;

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]]'s 1999 [[Resolution on Taiwan's Future]], which is accorded equivalent status as the Party charter, serves as the baseline of debates toward the "[[status quo]]". According to the 1999 Resolution: "Taiwan is a sovereign and independent state and that its national title is the ROC." In other words, "Taiwan is the ROC".&lt;ref name="Jamestown Foundation"&gt;[https://jamestown.org/program/dpps-cross-strait-policy-consistent-with-status-quo/ DPP’s Cross-Strait Policy Consistent with “Status Quo”], [[Jamestown Foundation]], 2011/12/20&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) administration under [[Chen Shui-bian]], he directed that all government publications and websites to use the form "'''Republic of China (Taiwan)'''." These two variations have been used under their respective administrations for the [[China and the United Nations|ROC/Taiwan petition to join the United Nations]]. Unlike the Cold War era when the KMT-controlled ROC competed with the PRC as the legitimate representative of [[China]] (including Taiwan), during Chen Shui-bian's presidency, the ROC did not seek to be the representative of China (i.e. it does not seek the PRC's seat on the Security Council or its ouster) and stresses in its petitions that it was only seeking to represent the people of the land under its effective control (i.e. UN's principle of universality).&lt;ref name="IBP"/&gt;

In October 8, 2011, the eve of the centennial celebration of the founding of the Republic of China on [[October 10]], the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) Chairperson [[Tsai Ing-wen]] and the presidential candidate for [[Taiwan presidential election, 2012|the 2012 Taiwan presidential election]] explained her stance on the existence of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]] as "...the Republic of China has lost the land on which it was originally established. It only exists in Taiwan. It has merged into the land and [[people of Taiwan]]. Today, the majority of the people in Taiwan can agree that '''Taiwan is the Republic of China, and the Republic of China is Taiwan.'''", "Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country", and "...after we [[Taiwan presidential election, 1996|began directly electing our president]], the current Republic of China government is no longer a foreign government. It is now the [[government of Taiwan]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/Read.aspx?sno=01EECCB4FEE085BC96BCD62A0FC3F053 Tsai presents “ROC is Taiwan” stance on eve of centenary], [[FTV News|Formosa News]], 2011/10/09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taipei Times"&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/10/10/2003515353 Tsai affirms recognition of the ROC], [[Taipei Times]], 2011/10/10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamestown Foundation"/&gt;

Chen Yi-shen (陳儀深), an associate researcher at the [[:zh:中央研究院近代史研究所|Institute of Modern History]] at [[Academia Sinica]], said "many are aware that the ROC and Taiwan are two faces of the same coin" and Tsai's ROC was an extension of the ROC from former presidents [[Lee Teng-hui]] and [[Chen Shui-bian]]. While some understood "elections have their own languages", many Taiwanese, including former [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] Chairman and former President of the [[Examination Yuan]] [[Yao Chia-wen]], are absolutely against the ROC and insist "we need to promote the rectification our nation's name to the [[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]".&lt;ref name="Taipei Times"/&gt;

Tsai won [[Taiwan presidential election, 2016|the 2016 Taiwan presidential election]] and sworn in as first female [[President of Taiwan]] on May 20.

The '''Free State Project''' ('''FSP''') is a proposed [[political migration]] founded in 2001 to recruit at least 20,000 [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] to move to a single low-population state ([[New Hampshire]], selected in 2003) in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html?pagewanted=all|first=Pam|last=Belluck|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2003|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project seeks to overcome the historical ineffectiveness of [[limited government]] activism which they believe was caused by the small number and diffuse population of libertarian activists across the 50 United States and around the world.

Participants sign a statement of intent declaring that they intend to move to New Hampshire within five years of the drive reaching 20,000 participants. This statement of intent is intended to function as a form of [[assurance contract]]. {{As of|2016|2|3|df=US}}, 20,000 people have signed this statement of intent&lt;ref name=membership&gt;{{cite web|title=Free State Project Triggers the Move|url=https://www.fsp.org/free-state-project-triggers-the-move-libertarians-new-hampshire/|publisher=Free State Project|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—completing the original goal—and 1,909 people are listed as "early movers" to New Hampshire on the FSP website, saying they had made their move prior to the 20,000-participant trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2296999/|title=Free State Project: What happens if 20,000 libertarians move to New Hampshire?|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately a dozen Free Staters were elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in the 2012 election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jake|last=Berry|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/994856-469/movement-starts-slowly-but-future-encouraging.html|title=Free State project says future is encouraging|work=Nashua Telegraph|date=February 24, 2013|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 18 in the 2014 election.

The FSP is a social movement generally based upon [[decentralized decision making]]. The group hosts various events, but most of FSP's activities depend upon volunteers, and no formal plan dictates to participants or movers what their actions should be in New Hampshire.

==Intent==
The FSP mission statement, adopted in 2005, states: {{Cquote|The Free State Project is an agreement among 20,000 pro-liberty activists to move to New Hampshire, where they will exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of government is the protection of life, liberty, and property. The success of the Project would likely entail reductions in taxation and regulation, reforms at all levels of government to expand individual rights and free markets, and a restoration of constitutional federalism, demonstrating the benefits of liberty to the rest of the nation and the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freestateproject.org/about/mission.php Mission Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118215151/http://freestateproject.org/about/mission.php |date=January 18, 2013 }} from the Free State Project website&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

===Origins===
The Free State Project was founded in 2001 by [[Jason Sorens]], then a Ph.D. student at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Clow |url=http://www.wirenh.com/Features/Cover_Story/the_Free_State_turns_two_20051005785.html |title=The Free State turns two |publisher=The Wire |date=October 5, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017050136/http://www.wirenh.com/Features/Cover_Story/the_Free_State_turns_two_20051005785.html |archivedate=October 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorens published an article in ''[[The Libertarian Enterprise]]'' highlighting the failure of libertarians to elect any candidate to federal office and outlining his ideas for a [[secession]]ist movement, calling people to respond to him with interest.&lt;ref name="tlesoren"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sorens | first= Jason | url= http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe131-20010723-03.html | title=Announcement: The Free State Project | journal=The Libertarian Enterprise | volume=131 | date=July 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorens soon published a follow-up article &lt;ref name="sorensfollowup"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sorens | first= Jason | url= http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe133-20010806-02.html | title=Update: Free State Project | journal=The Libertarian Enterprise | volume=132| date=August 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; backing away from secession, "and it never played a role in the FSP’s philosophy from then on.&lt;ref name="fsphistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Early Years of the Free State Project|url=https://www.fsp.org/history/|publisher=Free State Project|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Sorens has stated that the movement continues an American tradition of [[political migration]], which includes groups such as [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Utah]], [[Amish]] religious communities&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web| author=Joanna Walters | url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/01/usa.joannawalters | title=Free staters pick New Hampshire to liberate for sex, guns and drugs | work= [[The Guardian]] | date=October 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Jamestown Seventy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=yrlsa |first1=James F. |last1=Blumstein |first2=James |last2=Phelan |title=Jamestown Seventy |date=1971 |journal=[[Yale Review of Law and Social Action]] |volume=1 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier effort to influence the politics of a particular state through deliberate migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Libertarian Enterprise |volume=132 |date=August 6, 2001 |title=Update: Free State Project |last=Sorens |first=Jason |url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe133-20010806-02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FSP Gadsden Flag.gif|thumb|left|The flag of the Free State Project, a modified [[Gadsden flag]]]]
The organization began without a specific state in mind. A systematic review started by narrowing potential states to those with a population of less than 1.5 million and those where the combined spending in 2000 by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties was less than $5.2 million, the total national spending by the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] in that year. [[Hawaii]] and [[Rhode Island]] were eliminated from this list because of their propensity for centralized government.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Spear, [http://www.libarts.ucok.edu/opsa/OPSR/Journal%20Vol5-Number1/4-Student%20Contri%20butions.pdf "An Experiment in Civic Engagement: The Free State Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325044314/http://www.libarts.ucok.edu/opsa/OPSR/Journal%20Vol5-Number1/4-Student%20Contri%20butions.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}, ''Oklahoma Policy Studies Review'', Vol. 5, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===State selection===
In September 2003, the state vote was held and participants voted using the [[Condorcet method]] to choose the state.&lt;ref name="upandcoming"&gt;Pete Camp, [http://old.freestateproject.org/archives/state_vote/FSP-ECL-CertifyWhitePaper.htm "Free State Project Picks New Hampshire"], ''Up &amp; Coming Magazine'', October 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; New Hampshire was the winner, with Wyoming coming in second by a 57% to 43% margin.&lt;ref name="upandcoming" /&gt; Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont were also on the list.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

New Hampshire was chosen because the perceived individualist culture of the state was thought to resonate well with libertarian ideals.&lt;ref name="boston"/&gt; However, the Free State Project has drawn criticism from some New Hampshire residents concerned about population pressure and opposition to increased taxation. On the other hand, some Republicans have responded more favorably to the project because they also favor a small government.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Goldstein, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/10/09/free_state_project_pushes_limits_of_liberty_in_nh/ "Free State Project pushes limits of liberty in N.H."], ''Boston Globe'', October 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===
In December 2012, state representative [[Cynthia Chase]] (D-Keene) said "Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today. There is, legally, nothing we can do to prevent them from moving here to take over the state, which is their openly stated goal. In this country you can move anywhere you choose and they have that same right. What we can do is to make the environment here so unwelcoming that some will choose not to come, and some may actually leave. One way is to pass measures that will restrict the “freedoms” that they think they will find here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/27/new-hampshire-democrat-free-staters-are|title=New Hampshire Democrat: 'Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today'|work=Reason.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Concord Police Department applied for $258,000 in federal government funding to buy a [[Lenco BearCat]] armored vehicle for protection against terrorist attacks, riots, or shooting incidents. The application said: "Groups such as the Sovereign Citizens, Free Staters and Occupy New Hampshire are active and present daily challenges". The grant from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was successful and the Concord City Council unanimously approved of the grant after having revised the application to remove references to those political movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickham|first=Shawne K.|title=Civil Liberties Union questions increasing use of costly military-style equipment by NH law enforcement|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20130728/NEWS07/130729284|newspaper=Union Leader|date=July 27, 2013|location=Manchester, New Hampshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Republican Party Senate nominee [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]], a former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], said his election campaign needed "Freestaters" to support him in his one-minute closing statement at the Granite State Debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMtg48fQocE|title=Granite State Debate, U.S. Senate: Candidates deliver closing statements|date=September 4, 2014 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move triggered===
On February 3, 2016, the Free State Project announced via social media that 20,000 people had signed the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free State Project|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=February 2, 2016|url=https://twitter.com/FreeStateNH/status/694763068010713088?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference later that day, then FSP president [[Carla Gericke]] officially announced that the move had been triggered and that signers were expected to follow up on their pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freestateproject.org/blogs/free-state-project-officially-announces-20000-signers-100-reached|website=Freestateproject.org|date=2016|title=Official press conference announcing success in reaching 20,000 members}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project organization will change focus from recruiting signers to encouraging them to move to New Hampshire, stating "we want 20,000 movers".

==Political positions==
The Free State Project aligns itself with no political party, takes no official political positions, supports no candidates in elections and neither supports nor opposes any particular legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/intro Introduction to the Free State Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601025020/http://freestateproject.org/intro |date=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free State Project receives its funding from individual donors interested in moving as part of the FSP or attending one of the annual events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf Total income donations, FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816065430/http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2008Actuals.pdf |date=August 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2009-090331.pdf Total income donations FSPFY2009Actuals.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816065452/http://freestateproject.org/files/FSPFY2009-090331.pdf |date=August 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations are tax deductible as the FSP is a tax-exempt nonprofit educational organization, falling under category 501(c)(3). This affects all donations since July 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://madmimi.com/s/bc2215 FSP Newsletter], July 2014, From the President's Desk&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early movers have been elected to the New Hampshire legislature. In 2006, one of its participants, [[Joel Winters]], was elected to the [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]], running as a [[New Hampshire Democratic Party|Democrat]].&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web| subscription=yes|author= Sarah Schweitzer | title=Free State Project cheers on one of its own in Winters | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/11/26/free_state_project_cheers_one_of_its_own_in_winters/ | publisher=The Boston Globe | date=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in 2008, but defeated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.nh.gov/electwinwin.html List of Nov. 2010 winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205082004/http://www.sos.nh.gov/electwinwin.html |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 12 Republican Free Staters were elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="nationaljournal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/for-some-ron-paul-backers-a-new-motto-go-east-young-man-and-woman--20110510 | title=For Some Ron Paul Backers, a New Motto: Go East, Young Man (and Woman) | publisher=NationalJournal.com | date=May 10, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ArZQc604?url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/for-some-ron-paul-backers-a-new-motto-go-east-young-man-and-woman--20110510 | archivedate=September 22, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2012, Free Stater and self-described anarchist [[Tim O'Flaherty]] was elected to the state House of Representatives under the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] ticket, representing Manchester Ward 5.&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20121115/LOCALVOICES08/121119494 |date=November 14, 2012 |title=Anarchy in Ward 5? Well, not exactly |first=Mark |last=Hayward |publisher=Manchester Union Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was defeated for re-election in 2014.

In 2012, elected participants wrote and passed House Bill 418 which requires state agencies to consider [[Open-source software|open source]] software and data formats when making acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=2654797&amp;cid=38931563|title=New Hampshire Passes 'Open Source Bill' - Slashdot|work=slashdot.org|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it died in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB418/2011 New Hampshire House Bill 418]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual events==
The Free State Project is the official organizer of two annual events in New Hampshire:
* The [[New Hampshire Liberty Forum]] is a convention-style event with a wide variety of speakers, dinners and events.
* The Porcupine Freedom Festival (PorcFest)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://porcfest.com|title=PorcFest|work=PorcFest|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsp.org/tag/porcupine-freedom-festival/|title=Porcupine Freedom Festival Blog Entries|work=fsp.org|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a weeklong summer festival that takes place at a campground and it is "like [[Woodstock]] for rational people", says [[Roderick Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaeblog.com/2011/06/22/way-long-gone-part-2/|title=Way Long Gone, Part 2|work=aaeblog.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaeblog.com/2011/07/09/way-long-gone-part-3/|title=Way Long Gone, Part 3|work=aaeblog.com|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Robert P.|title=PorcFest 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5430/PorcFest-2011|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Hampshire House of Representatives==

==Responses==
On February 17, 2006, economist [[Walter Block]] publicly expressed his support for the FSP and is quoted as saying:
{{Cquote|You people are doing the Lord's work. The FSP is one of the freshest practical ideas for promoting liberty that has come out of the libertarian movement in the past few decades. May you succeed beyond your wildest dreams, and thus demonstrate in yet another empirical way the benefits and blessings of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestateproject.org/about/endorsements#block Walter Block's endorsement of the Free State Project]. ''FreeStateProject.org.'' 17 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jeffrey Tucker]] reflected about his experiences at the [[New Hampshire Liberty Forum]] in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], saying in part: "If you are willing to look past mainstream media coverage of American politics, you can actually find exciting and interesting activities taking place that rise above lobbying, voting, graft and corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Migration in Our Time |url=http://freestateproject.org/content/political-migration-our-time |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310194902/http://freestateproject.org/content/political-migration-our-time |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has been endorsed by [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ron Paul Supports the Free State Project |url=http://freestateproject.org/intro/ron_paul |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519122424/http://freestateproject.org/intro/ron_paul |archivedate=May 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Johnson Endorses the FSP|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLw12pbIU4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Lew Rockwell]] from the [[Mises Institute]] endorsed the project and referred to the city of [[Keene, New Hampshire]] as "The northern capital of libertarianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lew Rockwell Applauds the Free State Project|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md6zzipKNVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Führerprinzip''''' {{IPA-de|ˈfyːʀɐpʀɪnˌtsiːp||De-Führerprinzip.ogg}} ([[German language|German]] for "leader principle") prescribed the fundamental basis of political authority in the governmental structures of the [[Third Reich]]. This principle can be most succinctly understood to mean that "the ''Führer''{{'}}s word is above all written law" and that governmental policies, decisions, and offices ought to work toward the realization of this end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/resource/document/DOCNAC3.htm "Nazi Conspiracy &amp; Aggression Volume I Chapter VII: Means Used by the Nazi Conspiractors in Gaining Control of the German State"] ''A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust''&lt;/ref&gt; In actual political usage, it refers mainly to the practice of dictatorship within the ranks of a political party itself, and as such, it has become an earmark of political [[fascism]].

==Ideology==
The ''Führerprinzip'' was not invented by the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]]. [[Hermann von Keyserling]], an ethnically German philosopher from Estonia, was the first to use the term. One of Keyserling's central claims was that certain "gifted individuals" were "born to rule" on the basis of [[Social Darwinism]].

The [[ideology]] of the ''Führerprinzip'' sees each organization as a hierarchy of leaders, where every leader (''Führer'', in German) has absolute [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] in his own area, demands absolute obedience from those below him and answers only to his superiors.&lt;ref name="obedience"&gt;[http://www.shoaheducation.judahsglory.com/befehl.html "Befehlsnotstand &amp; the Führerprinzip"] ''Shoah Education''&lt;/ref&gt; This required obedience and loyalty even over concerns of right and wrong.&lt;ref name= "obedience"/&gt; The [[Führer|supreme leader]], [[Adolf Hitler]], answered to God and the German people. Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] has argued {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} that Hitler saw himself as an incarnation of ''[[auctoritas]]'', and as the living law or [[Organic law|highest law]] itself, effectively combining in his persona [[executive power]], [[judicial power]] and [[legislative power]]. After the campaign against the alleged [[Night of the Long Knives|Röhm Putsch]], Hitler declared: "in this hour, I was responsible for the fate of the German nation and was therefore the supreme judge of the German people!"&lt;ref name="sager37"&gt;{{cite book | last1= Sager |first1=Alexander |last2=Winkler |first2=Heinrich August |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Germany: The Long Road West. 1933-1990|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn= 0-19-926598-4}}|page=37&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Führerprinzip'' paralleled the functionality of military organizations, which continue to use a similar authority structure today, although in democratic countries members are supposed to be restrained by codes of conduct. The ''[[Freikorps]]'' &amp;ndash; German paramilitary organizations made up of men who had fought in [[World War I]] and been mustered out after Germany's defeat, but who found it impossible to return to civilian life &amp;ndash; were run on the Fuehrer Principle. Many of the same men had, earlier in life, been part of various German youth groups in the period from 1904-1913.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Savage|Savage, Jon]] (2007) ''Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture'' New York: Viking. pp.101-12. {{isbn|978-0-670-03837-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups had also accepted the idea of blind obedience to a leader.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham (1996), p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The justification  for the civil use of the ''Führerprinzip'' was that unquestioning obedience to superiors supposedly produced order and prosperity in which those deemed 'worthy' would share.

In the case of the Nazis, the ''Führerprinzip'' became integral to the Nazi Party in July 1921, when [[Adolf Hitler]] forced a showdown with the original leaders of the party after he learned that they were attempting to merge it with the somewhat larger [[German Socialist Party]]. Learning of this, and knowing that any merger would dilute his influence over the group, Hitler quit the Nazis. Realizing that the party would be completely ineffective without Hitler as their front man, the founder of the party, [[Anton Drexler]], opened negotiations with Hitler, who delivered an ultimatum: he must be recognized as the sole leader (''Führer'') of the party, with dictatorial powers. The executive committee gave in to his demands, and Hitler rejoined the party a few days later to become its permanent ruler, with Drexler kicked upstairs to be honorary chairman for life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham (1996), pp.78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, as the party expanded, it fragmented somewhat, with the northern faction led by the Strasser brothers, [[Otto Strasser|Otto]] and [[Gregor Strasser|Gregor]], and including [[Joseph Goebbels]], holding more socialist views then the southern faction controlled by Hitler in [[Munich]]. They differed in other ways as well, including on the party's acceptance of the Fuehrer Principle. In another confrontation engineered by Hitler, a party conference was called on February 14, 1926 in [[Bamberg, Germany|Bamberg]].  At this conference, Hitler won over the leaders of the northern faction with his oratorical skills, and the question of whether the NSDAP would follow the ''Führerprinzip'' was put to rest for good.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham (1996), pp.120-121&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Hitler finally came to absolute power, after being appointed Chancellor and assuming the powers of the President when [[Paul von Hindenburg]] died, he changed his title to "Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor", and the ''Führerprinzip'' became an integral part of German society. Appointed mayors replaced elected local governments. Schools lost elected parents' councils and faculty advisory boards, with all authority being put in the headmaster's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas (2006), p.74&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis suppressed associations and unions with elected leaders, putting in their place mandatory associations with appointed leaders. The authorities allowed private [[corporation]]s to keep their internal organization, but with a simple renaming from [[hierarchy]] to ''Führerprinzip''. Conflicting associations, e.g. sports associations responsible for the same sport, were ''coordinated'' into a single one under the leadership of a single ''Führer'', who appointed the ''Führer'' of a regional association, who appointed the sports club Führer, often appointing the person whom the club had previously elected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger|Kurger, Arns]] (1985) "'Heute gehört uns Deutschland und morgen …?' Das Ringen um den Sinn der Gleichschaltung im Sport in der ersten Jahreshälfte 1933." in Buss, Wolfgang and Krüger, Arnd (eds.) (1985) ''Sportgeschichte: Traditionspflege und Wertewandel. Festschrift zum 75. Geburtstag von Prof. Dr. Wilhelm Henze'' Duderstad: Mecke. pp.175–196.&lt;/ref&gt; Shop stewards had their authority carefully circumscribed to prevent their infringing on that of the plant leader.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Grunberger|Grunberger, Richard]] (1971) ''The 12-Year Reich'' New York: Henry Holt. p 193, {{ISBN|0-03-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, virtually no activity or organization in Germany could exist that was completely independent of party and/or state leadership.

[[Hermann Göring]] told [[Nevile Henderson]] that "When a decision has to be taken, none of us counts more than the stones on which we are standing. It is the Führer alone who decides".&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n41/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |location=New York| author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther| year=1940 | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the selection of unsuitable candidates often led to [[micromanagement]] and commonly to an inability to formulate coherent policy. [[Albert Speer]] noted that many Nazi officials dreaded making decisions in Hitler's absence. Rules tended to become oral rather than written; leaders with initiative who flouted regulations and carved out their own spheres of influence might receive praise and promotion rather than censure.

==Propaganda==
Many propaganda films developed the importance of the ''Führerprinzip''. ''[[Flüchtlinge]]'' depicted [[Volga German]] refugees saved from Communist persecution by a leader demanding unquestioning obedience.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser (1975), pp.29-30&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Der Herrscher]]'' altered its source material to depict its hero, Clausen, as the unwavering leader of his munitions firm, who, faced with his children's machinations, disowns them and bestows the firm on the state, confident that a worker will arise capable of continuing his work and, as a true leader, needing no instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser (1975), p.49&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Carl Peters (film)|Carl Peters]]'' shows the title character in firm, decisive action to hold and win African colonies, but brought down by a parliament that does not realize the necessity of ''Führerprinzip''.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser (1975), pp.104-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the schools, adolescent boys were presented with Nordic sagas as the illustration of ''Führerprinzip'', which was developed with such heroes as [[Frederick the Great]] and [[Otto von Bismarck]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas (2006), p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

This combined with the glorification of the one, central ''Führer''. During the [[Night of Long Knives]], it was claimed that his decisive action saved Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Koonz (2003), p.96&lt;/ref&gt; though it meant (in Goebbels's description) suffering "tragic loneliness" from being a [[Siegfried]] forced to shed blood to preserve Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Anthony (1976) ''Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II'' New York: Chelsea House. p.16 {{isbn|0877540292}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one speech [[Robert Ley]] explicitly proclaimed "The Führer is always right."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ley|Ley, Robert]] ((3 November 1937) [http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/ley2.htm "Fate - I Believe!"] ''German Propaganda Archive'' Calvin College website&lt;/ref&gt; Booklets given out for the [[Winter Relief]] donations included ''The Führer Makes History'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/booklet2.htm "Winterhilfswerk Booklet for 1933"] ''German Propaganda Archive'' Calvin College website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/booklet3.htm "Winterhilfswerk Booklet for 1938"] ''German Propaganda Archive'' Calvin College website&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of Hitler photographs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/booklet1.htm "Hitler in the Mountains"] ''German Propaganda Archive'' Calvin College website&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Führer’s Battle in the East''&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/booklet4.htm "Hitler in the East"] ''German Propaganda Archive'' Calvin College website&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[Der Marsch zum Führer]]'' and ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' glorified him.

[[Carl Schmitt]] &amp;ndash; drawn to the Nazi party by his admiration for a decisive leader&lt;ref&gt;Koonz (2003), p.56&lt;/ref&gt; praised him in his pamphlet ''State, Volk and Movement'' because only the ruthless will of such a leader could save Germany and its people from the "asphalt culture" of modernity, to bring about unity and authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Koonz (2003), p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Eichmann at Trial1961.jpg|thumb|187px|Adolf Eichmann on trial in 1961]]

==Application==
During the post-[[World War II|war]] [[Nuremberg Trials]], Nazi war criminals—and, later, [[Adolf Eichmann]] during the trial in [[Israel]]—used the ''Führerprinzip'' concept to argue that they were not guilty of war crimes by claiming that they were [[Nuremberg Defense|only following orders]]. Eichmann may have declared his conscience was inconvenienced by war events in order to "do his job" as best he could. 

In ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] concluded that, aside from a desire for improving his career, Eichmann showed no trace of [[anti-Semitism]] or psychological abnormalities whatsoever. She called him the embodiment of the "[[banality of evil]]", as he appeared at his trial to have an ordinary and common personality, displaying neither guilt nor hatred, denying any form of responsibility. Eichmann argued he was simply "doing his job" and maintained he had always tried to act in accordance with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]]. Arendt suggested that these statements most strikingly discredit the idea that Nazi criminals were manifestly psychopathic and different from common people, that even the most ordinary of people can commit horrendous crimes if placed in the catalyzing situation, and given the correct incentives. However, Arendt disagreed with this interpretation, as Eichmann justified himself with the ''Führerprinzip''. Arendt argued that children [[Obedience (human behavior)|obey]], whereas adults adhere to an ideology.

A '''hung parliament''' is a term used in legislatures under the [[Westminster system]] to describe a situation in which no particular [[political party]] or pre-existing [[coalition]] (also known as an alliance or bloc) has an [[absolute majority]] of [[legislator]]s (commonly known as members or seats) in a [[parliament]] or other [[legislature]]. This situation is also known, albeit less commonly, as a '''balanced parliament''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/minority-government-electoral-reform-editorial | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Balanced parliament: No need to rush | date=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/scotland/8630998.stm | work=BBC News | title=SNP puts case for hung parliament | date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a legislature under '''no overall control''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-48305720100507 | work=Reuters | title=Q+A - What happens if no party gets a majority in UK election? | date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/04/hung-parliament-minority-coalition-government | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Hung up on 'no overall control' | first=Akash | last=Paun | date=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/05/labour-brown-campaign-cameron |title=Welcome to the era of no overall control |publisher=Newstatesman.com |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can result in a [[minority government]]. The term is not relevant in [[multi-party system]]s where it is rare for a single party to hold a majority.

In the Westminster System, in the circumstance of a hung parliament, no party or coalition has an automatic [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] to assume control of the [[executive branch|executive]] – a status usually known in parliamentary systems as "forming (a) government". However, an absolute majority may still be gained through the formation of a new [[coalition government]], or the addition of previously unaffiliated members to a pre-existing coalition. However, a [[minority government]] may instead result: that is, the party that has the most members is allowed to form government without an absolute majority, provided that it has the express, ongoing support of unaffiliated members, such as [[minor parties]] and/or [[independent (politician)|independent]] legislators.

==Overview==
A normal objective of [[parliamentary system]]s – especially those requiring [[responsible government]], such as the [[Westminster system]] – is the formation of a stable government (i.e. ideally one that lasts a full parliamentary term, until the next election would normally be due). This requires a government to be able to muster sufficient votes in parliament to pass  motions of [[confidence and supply]], especially [[Motion of no confidence|motions of no-confidence]] and [[budget bill]]s). If such motions fail, they normally result in the [[dissolution of parliament]] and a fresh election. In some parliamentary systems, however, a new government may be formed without recourse to an election – if, for example, a minor party holds the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]], it may publicly express for the opposition, thereby creating a new majority.

The term hung parliament is most often used of parliaments dominated by [[two-party system|two major parties or coalitions]]. [[General election]]s in such systems usually result in one party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government. In most parliamentary systems, a hung parliament is considered exceptional and is often seen by all parties and observers as undesirable. In other contexts, a hung parliament may be seen as ideal – for example, if opinions among the voting public are polarised regarding one or more issues, a hung parliament may lead to the emergence of a compromise or consensus.

If a legislature is [[bicameralism|bicameral]], the term "hung parliament" is usually used only with respect to the [[lower house]].

In a [[multi-party system]] with legislators elected by [[proportional representation]] or a similar systems, it is usually exceptionally rare and difficult for any party to have an absolute majority. Under such situations, hung parliaments are often taken for granted and coalition governments are normal. However, the term may be used to describe an election in which no established coalition wins an outright majority (such as the [[German federal election, 2005|German federal election of 2005]] or the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 Italian general election]]).

==History==
===Ireland===
Because Ireland uses PR-STV, it is rare for any one party to have a majority on its own.  
The last such occasion was 1977.  However, one or other coalitions are known to be possible before and during the election.  Therefore, a "hung Dáil" (Dáil Éireann being the lower and most dominant chamber of the Oireachtas/Parliament) in Ireland refers more to the inability of a coalition of parties who traditionally enter government together or would be expected to govern together, from doing so.

The President has no direct role in the formation of governments in the case of a hung parliament.  However he retains the power to convene a meeting of either or both the Dáil and Senate which could become important if there was a government trying to use parliamentary recess to prevent confidence votes and hold onto power.  The President may also refuse to dissolve Dáil Eireann and call an election if the Taoiseach loses a vote of confidence, instead giving the other parties a chance to see if they can put together a government without proceeding to another election.

In 2016, Fine Gael and Labour, who had been in government the previous five years, were unable, due to Labours collapse, to enter government again.  Fianna Fáil had enough seats to put together a rainbow government with the other centre-left, hard left parties and independents but negotiations broke down.  Fianna Fáil had also promised not to enter coalition with Sinn Féin due to the current leaderships Provisional IRA connections.

The press began to speculate about a Germany style "Grand Coalition" similar to the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats there.  Many members of FF considered FG too right wing to enter coalition with and threatened to leave the party this came to pass.  As talks continued on without a new government (the old government, constitutionally, which had just been voted out, remaining in power including ministers who had lost their seats) FF agreed to allow a government to form by abstention.  The parliamentary arithmetic fell in such a way that if FF TD's abstained on confidence and supply matters, a FG minority govt could, with the support of a group of independents, form a new government.  This was agreed in exchange for a number of policy concessions.  
Once the deal with FF was signed, Taoiseach Enda Kenny conducted talks with the independents and entered government for a second term.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:UK House of Commons 2017.svg||thumb|right|230px|The House of Commons following the 2017 general election. No party has a majority.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], before World War I, a largely stable two-party system existed for generations; traditionally, only the [[Tories]] and [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], or from the mid-19th century the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties, managed to deliver Members of Parliament in significant numbers. Hung parliaments were thus rare, especially during the 19th century. The possibility of change arose when, in the aftermath of the [[Act of Union, 1800]], a number of Irish MPs took seats in the House, though initially [[History of Ireland 1801–1923#Home Rule movement (1870–1914)|these]] followed the traditional alignments. However, two Reform Acts ([[Reform Act 1867|in 1867]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1884|in 1884]]) significantly extended the franchise and redrew the constituencies, and coincided with [[Catholic Emancipation|a change in Irish politics]]. After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]], neither party had an overall majority.  The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power and made [[Irish Home Rule]] a condition of their support. However, the Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule, leading to [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|another general election in 1886]], in which the Conservatives won the most seats and governed with the support of the fragment of Liberalism opposed to Home Rule, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]].

Both the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|election of January 1910]], and that of [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] produced a hung parliament with an almost identical number of seats won by the governing Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This was due both to the constitutional crisis and to the rise of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|elections of 1929]] resulted in the last hung parliament for many years; in the meantime, Labour had replaced the Liberals as one of the two dominating parties.

Since the elections of 1929, there have been three general elections that resulted in hung parliaments in the UK.  The first was the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|election in February 1974]], and the ensuing parliament lasted only until [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October]]. The second was the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 election]], the result of which was a hung parliament with the Conservative party as the largest single party. The results for the 3 main parties were: Conservatives 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament "General election 2010 results of a hung parliament"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510024408/http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament/ |date=10 May 2010 }}, PoliticsRAW. May 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The third one resulted from the [[snap election]] held in [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|June 2017]] that had been called for by [[Theresa May]] in order to strengthen her majority heading into [[Brexit negotiations]] later in 2017. However, this election backfired on May and her [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], resulting in a hung parliament after the snap election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/election-2017-40171454|title=Election results 2017: UK wakes up to hung Parliament|date=2017-06-09|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the coalition resulting from the 2010 election led to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], which instituted fixed five-year Parliaments and transferred the power to call [[snap election|early election]]s from the Prime Minister to Parliament itself. This was the idea of the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]], then the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who said that this would stop the Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, [[David Cameron]], from calling a snap election to end the hung parliament, as many other Conservatives had requested.

Hung parliaments can also arise when slim government majorities are eroded by [[by-election]] defeats and [[crossing the floor|defection]] of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] to opposition parties, as well as resignations of MPs from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. This happened in December 1996 to the Conservative government of [[John Major]] (1990–97) and in mid-1978 to the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]] (1976–79); this latter period covers the era known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]. The minority government of Jim Callaghan came when Labour ended their 15-month [[Lib-Lab pact]] with the Liberals having lost their majority in early 1977.

According to researchers Andrew Blick and Stuart Wilks-Heeg, the phrase "hung parliament" did not enter into common usage in the UK until the mid-1970s. It was first used in the press by journalist [[Simon Hoggart]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |title=Governing without majorities: Coming to terms with balanced Parliaments in UK politics |first=Andrew |last=Blick |author2=Stuart Wilks-Heeg |date=April 2010 |publisher=Democratic Audit |location=Liverpool |page=2 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713091025/http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic treatments of hung parliaments include [[David Butler (academic)|David Butler]]'s ''Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliaments in Britain'' (Sheridan House, 1986) and [[Vernon Bogdanor]]'s 'Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).

===Canada===
{{Further|Federal minority governments in Canada}}

Three recent Canadian Parliaments ([[38th Canadian Parliament|the 38th]], [[39th Canadian Parliament|the 39th]], and [[40th Canadian Parliament|the 40th]] Parliaments) were hung parliaments, although that term is not used in Canada.  Rather, the term "minority government" is used to describe the situation in which the party with the greatest number of seats in the House of Commons (but less than a majority) forms the Government.  The aftermath of all three of these elections was that the largest party ruled as a "[[minority government]]". Although minority governments have tended to be short-lived, the two successive minorities under Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] managed to hold on to power from February 2006 until a [[no confidence vote]] in March 2011 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament and elections held on [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2 May 2011]]. The subsequent election saw a majority parliament elected with Harper's [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] obtaining a 24-seat majority. The make-up of the 40th Canadian Parliament hung parliament resulted in the [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute]]. The Conservative Party had a plurality of seats, however, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] together held enough seats to have a larger plurality and reached an accord to form a minority [[coalition government]]. The [[Bloc Québécois]] agreed to provide support on confidence votes. On 4 December 2008, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] granted [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] a [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogation]] on the condition that parliament reconvene early in the new year; the date was set as 26 January 2009. The first session of the 40th parliament thus ended, delaying a vote of no-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html|title=GG agrees to suspend Parliament: Harper| publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=2008-12-04|accessdate=2008-12-04| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205134535/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html| archivedate=5 December 2008| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Australian House of Reps Sept 2010.svg||thumb|right|230px|The House of Representatives elected in 2010, with a 72-72 tie between the Labor Party and the Opposition Coalition.]]
Australian parliaments are modelled on the [[Westminster system]], with a hung parliament typically defined as a lack of a lower house parliamentary majority from either the [[Australian Labor Party]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].

Hung parliaments are rare at the federal level in Australia, as a virtual [[two-party system]], in which the [[Australian Labor Party]] competes against an alliance of the [[conservatism|conservative]] parties, has existed with only brief interruptions since the early 20th century. Prior to 1910, no party had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As a result, there were frequent changes of government, several of which took place during parliamentary terms. Since 1910, when the two-party system was cemented, there have been two hung parliaments, the first in 1940, and the second in 2010. At the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]], incumbent Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] secured the support of the two [[crossbencher]]s and continued to govern, but in 1941 the independents switched their support to Labor, bringing [[John Curtin]] to power.

Declining support for the major parties in recent times is leading to more non-majoritarian outcomes at elections.&lt;ref name="pgia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Government in Australia |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |year=2014 |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=178308121X |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FmvUAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], which resulted in an exact 72-72 seat tie between Labor and The Liberal-National Coalition, incumbent Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] secured the support of four out of six Independent and Green Party crossbenchers and continued to govern.

In [[Australian federal election, 2016|the most recent election]] a hung parliament was only narrowly averted with the Liberal-National Coalition winning 76 seats, the bare minimum required to form a majority government. The Liberal-National Coalition government lost its majority government status after a [[Wentworth by-election, 2018|by-election in 2018]].

Having hung Parliaments in both Australia and the United Kingdom at the same time, and also briefly including Canada as well, is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth of Nations. 

Hung parliaments are rather more common at a state level. The [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] and the [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory]] are both elected by [[Hare-Clark]] proportional representation, thus, elections commonly return hung parliaments. In other states and territories, candidates contest single-member seats. With far fewer seats than federal parliament, hung parliaments are more likely to be elected. Recent examples include [[New South Wales state election, 1991|New South Wales in 1991]], Queensland in [[Queensland state election, 1998|1998]] and [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015]], [[Victorian state election, 1999|Victoria in 1999]], [[South Australian state election, 1997|South Australia in 1997]] and [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002]], [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australia in 2008]], the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008|Australian Capital Territory in 2008]], and [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|Tasmania in 2010]].

===New Zealand===
Hung parliaments had a relatively uncommon place in New Zealand politics prior to the introduction of proportional representation in 1993. Only on five occasions since the beginnings of modern party politics in [[New Zealand general election, 1890|1890]] has a hung parliament occurred, in [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911]], [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922]], [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928]], [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]] &amp; [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] respectively. The rarity between 1936 and 1996 was due to the regression into a two party system, alternating between the long dominating [[New Zealand Labour Party]] and [[New Zealand National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Bassett |first=Michael |title=Three Party Politics in New Zealand 1911–1931 |authorlink=Michael Bassett |year=1982 |publisher=Historical Publications |location= Auckland |isbn= 0-86870-006-1 |pages= 64–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996]] no single party has gained an outright majority in parliament. Subsequent governments have all been formed as either coalitions or under confidence and supply agreements. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Consequences==
In countries used to decisive election outcomes, a hung parliament is often viewed as an unfavourable outcome, leading to relatively weak and unstable government. A period of uncertainty after the election is common, as major party leaders negotiate with independents and minor parties to establish a working majority.

An aspiring [[head of government]] may seek to build a [[coalition government]]; in [[Westminster system]]s, this typically involves agreement on a joint legislative programme and a number of [[minister (government)|ministerial]] posts going to the minor coalition partners, in return for a stable majority. Alternatively, a minority government may be formed, establishing [[confidence and supply]] agreements in return for policy concessions agreed in advance, or relying on case by case support.

===Australia===
In the [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australian state election of 2008]] the [[Australian Labor Party]] won more seats than the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] at 28 to 24. The [[National Party of Australia (WA)|National Party]] along with three independents had the seats needed to give either party a majority. To help the Liberal Party form government, the Nationals supported the party on the condition that the [[Royalties for Regions policy]] was implemented.

In the [[Victorian state election, 1999|1999 Victorian state election]], the Labor Party won 42 seats, while the incumbent Liberal National Coalition retained 43, with 3 seats falling to independents. The Labor Party formed a minority government with the 3 independents.

The [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 Tasmanian state election]] resulted in a hung parliament.  After a period of negotiation, the incumbent Labor government led by [[David Bartlett]] was recommissioned, but containing the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens, [[Nick McKim]], as a minister, and the Greens' [[Cassy O'Connor]] as Cabinet Secretary.

In the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], neither Labor nor the Liberal coalition secured the majority of seats required to form a Government in their own right. In order to counter the potential instability of minority government involved groups may negotiate written agreements defining their terms of support.  Such measures were undertaken by the Gillard Government in 2010.&lt;ref name="gpia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Government Politics in Australia |last=Fenna |first=Alan |author2=Jane Robbins |author3=John Summers |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson Higher Education AU |isbn=1486001386 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tDDiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]] if an election results in a 'hung assembly' in one of the state [[Vidhan Sabha|Legislative Assemblies]] and no party is capable of gaining confidence then fresh elections are announced to be held as soon as possible. Until this occurs [[President's Rule]] (or in the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] 'Governor's Rule') is applied. In [[India]] there have been many situations of hung assemblies in the state legislatures.

===New Zealand===
The first such occasion was in [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911]] when the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] won fewer seats than the opposition [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]] despite tallying the most votes. A vote of no confidence was placed by Reform and the Liberals survived by just one vote. This prompted Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] to resign, his replacement [[Thomas Mackenzie]] was later defeated in July 1912 in a vote with several MPs and Labour crossing the floor to vote with the opposition, the last time in New Zealand history a government has changed on a confidence vote. This broke 23 years of Liberal governance and [[William Massey]] formed a new Reform Party government. Massey governed through to his death in 1925, though in [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922]] the Reform Party suffered major losses and Massey was forced negotiate with several Independent MPs to retain power.

In [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928]], Reform were ousted from governance and Joseph Ward once again won back power. However, the Reform and United (Liberal) parties were tied on seats with Labour holding the balance of power. Labour chose to back Ward rather than let Reform leader [[Gordon Coates]] remain in office. In the next election in [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]], there was again a three-way deadlock. On this occasion the Reform and United parties became a coalition government out of mutual fear of Labour's ever-increasing appeal as the [[Great Depression]] worsened.

[[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] was the last time a hung parliament occurred in New Zealand. Governor-General Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] asked Sir [[David Beattie]] to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as Prime Minister. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General|first=Gavin|last=McLean|publisher=Otago University Press|isbn=1-877372-25-0|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However National won an extra seat after special votes were counted, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats (4 were won by third party candidates). Labour's Sir [[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] agreed to become [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives]]. As a result, National did not lose a vote in the house and maintained a dubious majority for three years.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]], no party gained an overall parliamentary majority. Labour won the most seats (301, which was 17 seats short of an overall majority) with the Conservatives on 297 seats, although the Conservatives had a larger share of the popular vote. As the incumbent [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]] remained in office, attempting to build a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. When these negotiations were unsuccessful Heath resigned and Labour led by [[Harold Wilson]] took over in a minority government.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK General Election]], another hung parliament occurred with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] as the largest party, and discussions followed to help create a stable government. This resulted in agreement on a coalition government, which was also a [[majority government]], between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won the most votes and seats in the election, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK General Election]], a hung parliament occurred for the second time in seven years with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] again being the largest party. The Conservatives led by [[Theresa May]] formed a minority government, supported by a [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence-and-supply agreement]] with the [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

==Working majority==
There have been occasions when, although a parliament or assembly is technically hung, the party in power has a [[working majority]]. For example, in the United Kingdom, the tradition is that the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] and Deputy Speakers do not vote and [[Sinn Féin]] MPs never take their seats, so these members can be discounted from the opposition numbers.

===United Kingdom===
In 2005, this was the case in the 60-seat [[National Assembly for Wales]], where Labour lost their majority when [[Peter Law]] was expelled for standing against the official candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 Westminster election]] in the [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent constituency]]. When the Assembly was [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2003|first elected]] on 1 May 2003, [[Welsh Labour|Labour]] won 30 seats, [[Plaid Cymru]] won 12, the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservatives]] won 11, [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] won 6, and the [[John Marek Independent Party]] won a seat.

When [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] (Plaid Cymru) was reelected as the presiding officer, this reduced the number of opposition AMs who could vote to 29, as the presiding officer votes only in the event of a tie and, even then, not on party political lines but according to [[Speaker Denison's rule]]. Thus, Labour had a working majority of one seat until Law ran in Blaenau Gwent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200504/1c6a58e1-0c76-46b6-8b0d-f3fd085839fc.htm Labour lose assembly majority as Law quits], ePolitix.com.

'''Internal security''', or '''IS''', is the act of keeping peace within the [[border]]s of a [[sovereign state]] or other [[Self-governance|self-governing territories]], generally by upholding the national [[law]] and defending against internal security threats. Responsibility for internal security may range from [[police]] to [[paramilitary]] forces, and in exceptional circumstances, the [[military]] itself.

==Threats to internal security==
Threats to the general peace may range from low-level [[civil disorder]], large scale [[violence]], or even an armed [[insurgency]]. Threats to internal security may be directed at either the state's [[citizen]]s, or the organs and infrastructure of [[State (polity)|the state]] itself, and may range from petty [[crime]], serious [[organised crime]], political or industrial unrest, or even domestic [[terrorism]]. Foreign powers may also act as a threat to internal security, by either committing or sponsoring terrorism or [[rebellion]], without actually [[Declaration of war|declaring war]].

==Forces and agencies==
Governmental responsibility for internal security will generally rest with an [[interior ministry]], as opposed to a [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. Depending on the state, a state's internal security will be maintained by either the ordinary [[Law enforcement agency|police or law enforcement]] agencies or more militarised police forces (known as [[Gendarmerie]] or, literally, the [[Internal Troops]].). Other specialised internal security agencies may exist to augment these main forces, such as [[border guard]]s, [[List of special law enforcement units|special police unit]]s, or aspects of the state's [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]. In some states, internal security may be the primary responsibility of a [[secret police]] force.

The level of authorised force used by agencies and forces responsible for maintaining internal security might range from unarmed [[police]] to fully armed [[paramilitary]] organisations, or employ some level of [[less-lethal weapon]]ry in between. For violent situations, internal security forces may contain some element of military type equipment such as [[non-military armored vehicles]].

==Justice aspects==
Depending on the organisation of the state, internal security forces may have [[jurisdiction]] on national or [[Federation|federal]] levels. As the concept of internal security refers to the entity of the state and its citizens, persons who are threats to internal security may be designated as an [[enemy of the state]] or [[enemy of the people]].

Persons detained by internal security forces may either be dealt with by the normal [[criminal justice]] system, or for more serious crimes against internal security such as [[treason]], they may face special measures such as [[secret trial]]s. In times of extreme unrest, internal security actions may include measures such as [[internment]] (detention without trial).

==Relationship with the military==
Depending on the nature of the specific state's [[form of government]], enforcing internal security will generally not be carried out by a country's [[military]] forces, whose primary role is external defence, except in times of extreme unrest or other [[state of emergency]], short of [[civil war]]. Often, military involvement in internal security is explicitly prohibited, or is restricted to authorised [[military aid to the civil power]] as part of the principle of [[civilian control of the military]]. Military [[List of special forces units|special forces units]] may in some cases be put under the temporary command of civilian powers, for special internal security situations such as [[counter terrorism]] operations.

}}
The '''Iran hostage crisis''' was a diplomatic standoff between [[Iran]] and the [[United States of America]]. Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days from November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981, after a group of Iranian college students belonging to the [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]], who supported the [[Iranian Revolution]], took over the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|U.S. Embassy]] in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History Guy: Iran-U.S. Hostage Crisis (1979–1981)|url=http://www.historyguy.com/iran-us_hostage_crisis.html|publisher=historyguy.com|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands as the longest hostage crisis in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Köhler, Michael; 'Two Nations, a Treaty, and the World Court – An Analysis of United States-Iranian Relations under the Treaty of Amity before the International Court of Justice'; ''Wisconsin International Law Journal'', 18 (Winter 2000), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis was described by Western media as an "entanglement" of "vengeance and mutual incomprehension".&lt;ref name="TIME_1981-01-26"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Long Ordeal of the Hostages |last=Skow |first=John |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=26 January 1981 |accessdate=2015-05-27 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954605,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; American President [[Jimmy Carter]] called the hostage-taking an act of "blackmail" and the hostages "victims of terrorism and anarchy".&lt;ref name=Carter1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2010/April%202010/0410fullkeeper.pdf |title=Air Force Magazine |publisher=Air Force Magazine |date=2016-04-05 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran it was widely seen as an act against the U.S. and its influence in Iran, including its perceived attempts to undermine the Iranian Revolution and its longstanding support of the Shah of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], who was overthrown in 1979.&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kinzer|first1=Stephen|title=Thirty-five years after Iranian hostage crisis, the aftershocks remain |publisher= The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/11/04/thirty-five-years-after-iranian-hostage-crisis-aftershocks-remain/VIEKSajEUvSmDQICGF8R7K/story.html|website=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being overthrown, Shah Pahlavi was admitted to the U.S. for cancer treatment. Iran demanded that he be returned to stand trial for crimes he was accused of committing during his reign. Specifically, he was accused of committing crimes against Iranian citizens with the help of [[SAVAK|his secret police]]. Iran's demands were rejected by the United States, and Iran saw the decision to grant him asylum as American complicity in those atrocities.

The crisis reached a climax after diplomatic negotiations failed to win release for the hostages. Carter ordered the U.S. military to attempt a rescue operation using warships—including the {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|6}} and {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}—that were patrolling the waters near Iran. On April 24, 1980, the attempt, known as [[Operation Eagle Claw]], failed, resulting in the accidental deaths of eight American servicemen and one Iranian civilian, as well as the destruction of two helicopters. Six American diplomats who had evaded capture were eventually rescued by a [[Canadian Caper#Rescue|joint CIA-Canadian effort]] on January 27, 1980.

Shah Pahlavi left the United States in December 1979 and was ultimately granted asylum in [[Egypt]], where he died from complications of cancer on July 27, 1980. In September 1980 the [[Iraqi security forces|Iraqi military]] invaded Iran, beginning the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. These events led the Iranian government to enter negotiations with the U.S., with [[Algeria]] acting as a mediator. The crisis is considered a pivotal episode in the history of [[Iran–United States relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130419175811/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 19, 2013 |title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places &amp;#124; Smithsonian |website=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===1953 coup d'état===
{{further|Operation Ajax|Iranian Revolution}}
In February 1979, less than a year before the crisis, the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown during the [[Iranian Revolution]].  For several decades before that, the United States had [[United States–Iran relations|allied with and supported]] the Shah. During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] powers [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupied]] Iran to force the abdication of first Pahlavi monarch [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], in favor of his eldest son, Crown Prince Mohammad.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'', (1982), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies feared that Reza Shah intended to align his petroleum-rich country with [[Nazi Germany]], but Reza Shah's earlier declaration of neutrality, and his refusal to allow Iranian territory to be used to train or supply Soviet troops against Germany, were the strongest motives for the Allied invasion of Iran. Because of its importance in the Allied victory, Iran was subsequently called "The Bridge of Victory" by [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country name calling: the case of Iran vs. Persia. |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6583215/Country-name-calling-the-case.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213175117/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6583215/Country-name-calling-the-case.html |archivedate=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] was engaged in a power struggle with Iran's prime minister, [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], an immediate descendant of the preceding [[Qajar dynasty]]. Mosaddegh led a general strike on behalf of impoverished Iranians, demanding a share of the nation's petroleum revenue from Britain's [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]. However, he overstepped in trying to get $50 million in damages and lost revenue from the British.&lt;ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;52 poverty p.&amp;nbsp;54 Postwar Brit, p.&amp;nbsp;63 acceptance of 50:50 split, demand for $50 million in damages &amp; back revenues, The Persian Puzzle, Kenneth M.

===Carter administration===
Months before the revolution, on New Year's Eve 1977, President Carter further angered anti-Shah Iranians with a televised toast to Pahlavi, declaring how beloved the shah was by his people. After the revolution culminated in February 1979 with the return of Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] from France, the American Embassy was occupied and its staff held hostage briefly. Rocks and bullets had broken so many of the embassy's front-facing windows that they had been replaced with [[bulletproof glass]]. The embassy's staff was reduced to just over 60 from a high of nearly one thousand earlier in the decade.&lt;ref name="Bowden 2006, p. 19"&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carter administration tried to mitigate anti-American feeling by promoting a new relationship with the ''de facto'' Iranian government and continuing military cooperation in hopes that the situation would stabilize. However, on October 22, 1979, the United States permitted the Shah, who had [[lymphoma]], to enter [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital|New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center]] for medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Daniels|first=Lee A.|date=October 24, 1979|title=Medical tests in Manhattan|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/24/archives/medical-tests-in-manhattan-jaundice-in-patient-reported.html}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|date=October 24, 1979|title=Jaundice in patient reported|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/24/archives/medical-tests-in-manhattan-jaundice-in-patient-reported.html}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|date=October 25, 1979|title=Shah's surgeons unblock bile duct and also remove his gallbladder|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/25/archives/shahs-surgeons-unblock-bile-duct-and-also-remove-his-gallbladder.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department had discouraged the request, understanding the political delicacy.&lt;ref name="Bowden 2006, p. 19"/&gt; But in response to pressure from influential figures including former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Council on Foreign Relations]] Chairman [[David Rockefeller]], the Carter administration decided to grant it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/archives_roll/2003_01-03/dauherty_shah/dauherty_shah.html |title=Daugherty &amp;#124; Jimmy Carter and the 1979 Decision to Admit the Shah into the United States |website=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Farber"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOc-SCVsfJAC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=us+hostage+crisis+chase+manhattan&amp;source=web&amp;ots=XNzMh-F0Ev&amp;sig=T8rxK2qMhpUpyVQfbEcRSWF-DuA |title=Taken Hostage: The Iran Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with ... |author=David Farber |page=122 |website=Books.google.com |date=1979-11-04 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/06/005063.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610193827/http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/06/005063.php |archivedate=June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shah's admission to the United States intensified Iranian revolutionaries' anti-Americanism and spawned rumors of another U.S.–backed coup that would re-install him.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/3/stephen_kinzer_on_the_us_iranian |title=Stephen Kinzer on US-Iranian Relations, the 1953 CIA Coup in Iran and the Roots of Middle East Terror |publisher=Democracy Now! |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayatollah Khomeini, who had been exiled by the shah for 15 years, heightened the rhetoric against the "[[Great Satan]]", as he called the United States, talking of "evidence of American plotting".&lt;ref&gt;Moin ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ending what they believed was American sabotage of the revolution, the hostage takers hoped to depose the [[The Interim Government of Iran|provisional revolutionary government]] of Prime Minister [[Mehdi Bazargan]], which they believed was plotting to normalize relations with the United States and extinguish Islamic revolutionary order in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of the embassy on November 4, 1979, was also intended as leverage to demand the return of the shah to stand trial in Iran in exchange for the hostages.

A later study claimed that there had been no American plots to overthrow the revolutionaries, and that a CIA intelligence-gathering mission at the embassy had been "notably ineffectual, gathering little information and hampered by the fact that none of the three officers spoke the local language, [[Persian language|Persian]]." Its work, the study said, was "routine, prudent espionage conducted at diplomatic missions everywhere."&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homelandsecurity.org/newjournal/BookReviews/displayBookReview2.asp?review=63 |title=Journal of Homeland Security review of Mark Bowden's "Guests of the Ayatollah" |accessdate=2007-02-25 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===First attempt===
{{further|Kenneth Kraus}}
On the morning of February 14, 1979 – the same day that the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Adolph Dubs]], was kidnapped and fatally shot by Muslim extremists in [[Kabul]]&lt;ref name=Spectator_Dubs&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lord |first1=Jeffrey |title=Jimmy Carter's Dead Ambassador |url=http://spectator.org/articles/34550/jimmy-carters-dead-ambassador  |publisher=The American Spectator |date=23 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took a Marine named [[Kenneth Kraus]] hostage. [[William H.

===Second attempt===
The next attempt to seize the American Embassy was planned for September 1979 by [[Ebrahim Asgharzadeh]], a student at the time. He consulted with the heads of the Islamic associations of Tehran's main universities, including the [[University of Tehran]], [[Sharif University of Technology]], [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] (Polytechnic of Tehran), and [[Iran University of Science and Technology]]. They named their group [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]].

Asgharzadeh later said there were five students at the first meeting, two of whom wanted to target the Soviet Embassy because the USSR was "a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and anti-God regime". Two others, [[Mohsen Mirdamadi]] and [[Habibolah Bitaraf]], supported Asgharzadeh's chosen target: the United States. "Our aim was to object against the American government by going to their embassy and occupying it for several hours," Asgharzadeh said. "Announcing our objections from within the occupied compound would carry our message to the world in a much more firm and effective way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Mark Bowden|Bowden, Mark]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200412/bowden |title=Among the Hostage-Takers |work=The Atlantic |date=December 2004 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirdamadi told an interviewer, "We intended to detain the diplomats for a few days, maybe one week, but no more."&lt;ref&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;335&lt;/ref&gt; [[Masoumeh Ebtekar]], the spokeswoman for the Iranian students during the crisis, said that those who rejected Asgharzadeh's plan did not participate in the subsequent events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irannegah.com/Video.aspx?id=579 |title=Iran Negah |publisher=Iran Negah |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The students observed the procedures of the [[Marine Security Guard]]s from nearby rooftops overlooking the embassy. They also drew on their experiences from the recent revolution, during which the U.S. Embassy grounds were briefly occupied. They enlisted the support of police officers in charge of guarding the embassy and of the Islamic [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 8, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the group and other sources, Ayatollah Khomeini did not know of the plan beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Radicals Reborn |author=Scott Macleod |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992548,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=November 15, 1999|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students had wanted to inform him, but according to the author [[Mark Bowden]], Ayatollah [[Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha]] persuaded them not to. Khoeiniha feared that the government would use the police to expel the students as they had the occupiers in February. The provisional government had been appointed by Khomeini, and so Khomeini was likely to go along with the government's request to restore order. On the other hand, Khoeiniha knew that if Khomeini first saw that the occupiers were faithful supporters of him (unlike the leftists in the first occupation) and that large numbers of pious Muslims had gathered outside the embassy to show their support for the takeover, it would be "very hard, perhaps even impossible", for him to oppose the takeover, and this would paralyze the Bazargan administration, which Khoeiniha and the students wanted to eliminate.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the takeover stated that their motivation was fear of another American-backed coup against their popular revolution. They claimed that in 1953, the American Embassy had acted as a "den of spies" from which the coup was organized. Documents were later found in the embassy suggesting that some staff members had been working with American intelligence agencies. After the Shah entered the United States, Ayatollah Khomeini called for street demonstrations.

===Takeover===
[[File:Two American hostages in Iran hostage crisis.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Two American hostages during the siege of the U.S. Embassy.]]
On November 4, 1979, one of the demonstrations organized by Iranian student unions loyal to Khomeini erupted into an all-out conflict right outside the walled compound housing the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Embassy.

Around 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., the ringleaders gathered between three hundred and five hundred selected students and briefed them on the battle plan. A female student was given a pair of metal cutters to break the chains locking the embassy's gates and hid them beneath her [[chador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macleod |first=Scott |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992548,00.html |title=Radicals Reborn |publisher=TIME |date=1999-11-15 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the students planned a symbolic occupation, in which they would release statements to the press and leave when government security forces came to restore order. This was reflected in placards saying: "Don't be afraid. We just want to sit in." When the embassy guards brandished firearms, the protesters retreated, with one telling the Americans, "We don't mean any harm."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 40, 77&lt;/ref&gt; But as it became clear that the guards would not use deadly force and that a large, angry crowd had gathered outside the compound to cheer the occupiers and jeer the hostages, the plan changed.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 127–28&lt;/ref&gt; According to one embassy staff member, buses full of demonstrators began to appear outside the embassy shortly after the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line broke through the gates.&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;Bowden 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As Khomeini's followers had hoped, Khomeini supported the takeover. According to Foreign Minister Yazdi, when he went to [[Qom]] to tell Khomeini about it, Khomeini told him to "go and kick them out." But later that evening, back in Tehran, Yazdi heard on the radio that Khomeini had issued a statement supporting the seizure, calling it "the second revolution" and the embassy an "American spy den in Tehran".&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iran Hostage Crisis Newsreel.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=7|A two-minute [[video clip|clip]] from a [[newsreel]] regarding the hostage crisis (1980)]]
The occupiers bound and blindfolded the Marines and staff at the embassy and paraded them in front of photographers. In the first couple of days, many of the embassy workers who had sneaked out of the compound or had not been there at the time of the takeover were rounded up by Islamists and returned as hostages.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 50, 132–34&lt;/ref&gt; Six American diplomats managed to avoid capture and took refuge in the British Embassy before being transferred to the Canadian Embassy. Others went to the Swedish Embassy in Tehran for three months. In a joint covert operation known as the [[Canadian caper]], the Canadian government and the CIA managed to smuggle them out of Iran on January 28, 1980, using Canadian passports and a cover story that identified them as a film crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/list_of_hostages.phtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041108083936/http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/list_of_hostages.phtml |archivedate=November 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations===
The Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line demanded that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi return to Iran for trial and execution. The U.S. maintained that the Shah—who was to die less than a year later, in July 1980—had come to America for medical attention. The group's other demands included that the U.S. government apologize for its interference in the internal affairs of Iran, including the overthrow of Prime Minister Mosaddegh in 1953, and that [[Iran's frozen assets]] in the United States be released.

[[File:Iran-hostages-b.jpg|thumb|left|Barry Rosen, the embassy's press attaché, was among the hostages. The man on the right holding the briefcase is [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the 1979 hostage crisis|alleged by some former hostages]] to be future President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], although he, Iran's government, and the [[CIA]] deny this.]]
The initial plan was to hold the embassy for only a short time, but this changed after it became apparent how popular the takeover was and that Khomeini had given it his full support.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt; Some attributed the decision not to release the hostages quickly to President Carter's failure to immediately deliver an ultimatum to Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2001), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; His initial response was to appeal for the release of the hostages on humanitarian grounds and to share his hopes for a strategic [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] alliance with the Ayatollah.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p. 221; "America Can't do a *** Thing" by Amir Taheri ''New York Post,'' November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; As some of the student leaders had hoped, Iran's moderate prime minister, Bazargan, and his cabinet resigned under pressure just days after the takeover.

The duration of the hostages' captivity has also been attributed to internal Iranian revolutionary politics. As Ayatollah Khomeini told Iran's president:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theocratic [[Islamism|Islamists]], as well as leftist political groups like the socialist [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand (1989), ''The Iranian Mojahedin'' (1989), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; supported the taking of hostages as a counterattack against "[[American imperialism]]". According to scholar [[Daniel Pipes]], writing in 1980, the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-leaning leftists and the Islamists shared a common antipathy toward market-based reforms under the late Shah, and both subsumed individualism, including the unique identity of women, under conservative, though contrasting, visions of collectivism. Accordingly, both groups favored the Soviet Union over the United States in the early months of the Iranian Revolution.&lt;ref name="PipesNYT1980"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pipes|first1=Daniel|authorlink1=Daniel Pipes|title=Khomeini, the Soviets and U.S.: why the Ayatollah fears America|work=[[New York Times]]|date=May 27, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets, and possibly their allies [[Cuba]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Libya]], and East Germany, were suspected of providing indirect assistance to the participants in the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] under [[Yasser Arafat]] provided personnel, intelligence liaisons, funding, and training for Khomeini's forces before and after the Revolution, and was suspected of playing a role in the embassy crisis.&lt;ref name="Bergman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=Ronan|title=The Secret War with Iran: the 30-Year Clandestine Struggle against the World's Most Dangerous Terrorist Power|date=2008|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=9781416577003|pages=30–31|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fidel Castro]] reportedly praised Khomeini as a revolutionary anti-imperialist who could find common cause between revolutionary socialists and anti-American Islamists.

Revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy, sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after [[paper shredder|shredding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/publications/iran/irdoc.html |title=Iran, 1977–1980/Document |website=Gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to buttress their claim that "the Great Satan" (the U.S.) was trying to destabilize the new regime and that Iranian moderates were in league with the U.S. The documents – including telegrams, correspondence, and reports from the U.S. [[State Department]] and CIA – were published in a series of books called ''Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den'' ({{lang-fa|اسناد لانه جاسوسی امریكا}}). According to a 1997 [[Federation of American Scientists]] bulletin, by 1995, 77 volumes of ''Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den'' had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/bulletin/sec70.html |title=Secrecy &amp; Government Bulletin, Issue 70 |website=Fas.org |date=1997-05-29 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these volumes are now available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/DocumentsFromTheU.s.EspionageDen |title=Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By embracing the hostage-taking under the slogan "America can't do a thing", Khomeini rallied support and deflected criticism of his controversial [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|theocratic constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;Arjomand, Said Amir, ''Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran'' by Said Amir Arjomand, Oxford University Press, 1988 p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; which was scheduled for a referendum vote in less than one month.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was successful, and after the vote, both leftists and theocrats continued to use allegations of pro-Americanism to suppress their opponents: relatively moderate political forces that included the Iranian Freedom Movement, the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]], Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]],&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 229, 231; Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984), pp. 115–16&lt;/ref&gt; and later President [[Abolhassan Banisadr]]. In particular, carefully selected diplomatic dispatches and reports discovered at the embassy and released by the hostage-takers led to the disempowerment and resignation of moderate figures&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; such as Bazargan. The failed rescue attempt and the political danger of any move seen as accommodating America delayed a negotiated release of the hostages. After the crisis ended, leftists and theocrats turned on each other, with the stronger theocratic group annihilating the left.

===Hostage conditions===
The hostage-takers, declaring their solidarity with other "oppressed minorities" and "the special place of women in Islam", released one woman and two [[African Americans]] on November 19.&lt;ref name="If"&gt;Efty, Alex; 'If Shah Not Returned, Khomeini Sets Trial for Other Hostages'; ''[[Kentucky New Era]]'', November 20, 1979, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Before release, these hostages were required by their captors to hold a press conference in which Kathy Gross and William Quarles praised the revolution's aims,&lt;ref&gt;Farber, ''Taken Hostage'' (2005), pp. 156–57&lt;/ref&gt; but four further women and six African-Americans were released the following day.&lt;ref name="If"/&gt; The only African-American hostage not released that month was Charles A. Jones, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/27/us/no-headline-240600.html|title = Black Hostage Reports Abuse|last = |first = |date = January 27, 1981|work = |access-date = January 4, 2016|via = |publisher = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One more hostage, a white man named [[Richard Queen]], was released in July 1980 after he became seriously ill with what was later diagnosed as [[multiple sclerosis]]. The remaining 52 hostages were held until January 1981, up to 444 days of captivity.

The hostages were initially held at the embassy, but after the failed rescue mission, they were scattered around Iran to make a single rescue impossible. Three high-level officials – [[Bruce Laingen]], [[Victor L. Tomseth]], and Mike Howland – were at the Foreign Ministry at the time of the takeover. They stayed there for some months, sleeping in the ministry's formal dining room and washing their socks and underwear in the bathroom. At first, they were treated as diplomats, but after the provisional government fell, their treatment deteriorated. By March, the doors to their living space were kept "chained and padlocked."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 151, 219, 372&lt;/ref&gt;

By midsummer 1980, the Iranians had moved the hostages to prisons in Tehran&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent escapes or rescue attempts and to improve the logistics of guard shifts and food delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 514–15&lt;/ref&gt; The final holding area, from November 1980 until their release, was the [[Teymur Bakhtiar]] mansion in Tehran, where the hostages were finally given tubs, showers, and hot and cold running water.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 565&lt;/ref&gt; Several foreign diplomats and ambassadors – including former Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]] – visited the hostages over the course of the crisis and relayed information back to the U.S. government, including dispatches from Laingen.

[[File:Revolutionary occupation of U.S. embassy Title of Islamic Republican newspaper in November 5, 1979.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|A headline in an [[Islamic Republican newspaper]] on November 5, 1979, read "Revolutionary occupation of U.S. embassy".]]

Iranian propaganda stated that the hostages were "guests" and were treated with respect. Asgharzadeh, the student leader, described the original plan as a nonviolent and symbolic action in which the "gentle and respectful treatment" of the hostages would dramatize to the world the offended sovereignty and dignity of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In America, an Iranian [[chargé d'affaires]], Ali Agha, stormed out of a meeting with an American official, exclaiming: "We are not mistreating the hostages. They are being very well taken care of in Tehran. They are our guests."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual treatment was far different. The hostages described beatings,&lt;ref&gt;Rick Kupke in Bowden 2006, p. 81, Charles Jones, Colonel Dave Roeder, Metrinko, Tom Ahern (in Bowden 2006, p. 295)&lt;/ref&gt; theft,&lt;ref&gt;Hall in Bowden 2006, p. 257, Limbert in Bowden 2006, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt; and fear of bodily harm. Two of them, William Belk and Kathryn Koob, recalled being paraded blindfolded before an angry, chanting crowd outside the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;in Bowden 2006, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Others reported having their hands bound "day and night" for days&lt;ref&gt;Bill Belk in Bowden 2006, pp. 65, 144, Malcolm Kalp in Bowden 2006, pp. 507–11&lt;/ref&gt; or even weeks;&lt;ref&gt;Queen, in Bowden 2006, p. 258, Metrinko, in Bowden 2006, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; long periods of solitary confinement;&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 307, 344, 405, 540&lt;/ref&gt; and months of being forbidden to speak to one another&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 149, 351–52&lt;/ref&gt; or to stand, walk, or leave their space unless they were going to the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; All of the hostages "were threatened repeatedly with execution, and took it seriously".&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The hostage-takers played [[Russian roulette]] with their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hfhkAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6225,19155|title=Russian roulette played with hostages|place=New York|agency=Associated Press|work=Edmonton Journal|date=January 21, 1981|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most terrifying night for the hostages came on February 5, 1980, when guards in black ski masks roused them from their sleep and led them blindfolded to other rooms. They were searched after being ordered to strip naked and keep their hands up. They were then told to kneel down, still wearing blindfolds. "This was the greatest moment," one hostage said. Another later recalled, "It was an embarrassing moment. However, we were too scared to realize it." The guards cocked their weapons and readied them to fire, but finally ejected their rounds and told the prisoners to get dressed. The hostages were later told that the exercise had been "just a joke," something the guards "had wanted to do."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 346–50&lt;/ref&gt;

One, Michael Metrinko, was kept in solitary confinement for months. On two occasions, when he expressed his opinion of Ayatollah Khomeini, he was punished severely. The first time, he was kept in handcuffs for two weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; and the second time, he was beaten and kept alone in a freezing cell for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hostage, U.S. Army medic Donald Hohman, went on a [[hunger strike]] for several weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; and two hostages attempted suicide. Steve Lauterbach broke a water glass and slashed his wrists after being locked in a dark basement room with his hands tightly bound. He was found by guards and rushed to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Miele, a CIA communication technician, smashed his head into the corner of a door, knocking himself unconscious and cutting a deep gash. "Naturally withdrawn" and looking "ill, old, tired, and vulnerable," Miele had become the butt of his guards' jokes, and they had rigged up a mock electric chair to emphasize the fate that awaited him. His fellow hostages applied first aid and raised the alarm, and he was taken to a hospital after a long delay created by the guards.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 516–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hostages described threats to boil their feet in oil (Alan B. Golacinski),&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; cut their eyes out (Rick Kupke),&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt; or kidnap and kill a disabled son in America and "start sending pieces of him to your wife" (David Roeder).&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

Four hostages tried to escape,&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Kalp in Bowden 2006, pp. 507–11, Joe Subic, Kevin Hemening, and Steve Lauterbach, in Bowden 2006, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; and all were punished with stretches of solitary confinement when their attempts were discovered.

[[File:DF-SN-82-06759.jpg|thumb|A group photograph of the fifty-two hostages in a Wiesbaden hospital where they spent a few days after their release.]]
Queen, the hostage sent home because of his multiple sclerosis, first developed dizziness and numbness in his left arm six months before his release.&lt;ref&gt;December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; His symptoms were misdiagnosed by the Iranians at first as a reaction to drafts of cold air. When warmer confinement did not help, he was told that it was "nothing" and that the symptoms would soon disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Over the months, the numbness spread to his right side, and the dizziness worsened until he "was literally flat on his back, unable to move without growing dizzy and throwing up."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt;

The cruelty of the Iranian prison guards became "a form of slow torture."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; The guards often withheld mail – telling one hostage, Charles W. Scott, "I don't see anything for you, Mr. Scott. Are you sure your wife has not found another man?"&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; – and the hostages' possessions went missing.&lt;ref&gt;'Hall's apartment ransacked' in Bowden 2006, p. 257, Roeder's in Bowden 2006, p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;

As the hostages were taken to the aircraft that would fly them out of Tehran, they were led through a gauntlet of students forming parallel lines and shouting, "Marg bar Amrika" ("[[death to America]]").&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; When the pilot announced that they were out of Iran, the "freed hostages went wild with happiness. Shouting, cheering, crying, clapping, falling into one another's arms."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact in the United States===
[[File:Heckler2.jpg|thumb|A heckler in Washington, D.C., leans across a police line toward a demonstration of Iranians in August 1980.]]
In the United States, the hostage crisis created "a surge of patriotism" and left "the American people more united than they have been on any issue in two decades".&lt;ref name="TIMEkhomeini"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man of the Year: The Mystic Who Lit The Fires of Hatred |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923854,00.html |newspaper=Time |date=January 7, 1980 |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hostage-taking was seen "not just as a diplomatic affront", but as a "declaration of war on diplomacy itself."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Doing Satan's Work in Iran", ''New York Times'', November 6, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Television news gave daily updates.&lt;ref&gt;The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] late-night program ''America Held Hostage'', anchored by [[Ted Koppel]], later became a stalwart news magazine under the title ''[[Nightline]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1980, the ''CBS Evening News'' anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] began ending each show by saying how many days the hostages had been captive.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer, Julian E. ''Jimmy Carter: the 39th President, 1977–81.'' New York: Times, 2010.
Print.&lt;/ref&gt; President Carter applied economic and diplomatic pressure: Oil imports from Iran were ended on November 12, 1979, and with [[Executive Order 12170]], around US$8 billion of Iranian assets in the United States were frozen by the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] on November 14.

During the weeks leading up to Christmas in 1979, high school students made cards that were delivered to the hostages.&lt;ref name="TIME_1981-01-26"/&gt; Community groups across the country did the same, resulting in bales of Christmas cards. The [[National Christmas Tree (United States)|National Christmas Tree]] was left dark except for the top star.

The two Trenton, N.J., newspapers at the time, ''The Trenton Times'' and ''the Trentonian'' and perhaps others around the country, printed full-page color American flags in their newspapers for readers to cut out and place in the front windows of their homes as support for the hostages to be left in their windows until the hostages were brought home safely.

A severe backlash against Iranians in the United States developed. One [[Iranian Americans|Iranian American]] later complained, "I had to hide my Iranian identity not to get beaten up, even at university."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahari |first=Maziar |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2008/09/iran-ahmadinejad-government |title=Inside Iran |website=Newstatesman.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bowden, a pattern emerged in President Carter's attempts to negotiate the hostages' release: "Carter would latch on to a deal proffered by a top Iranian official and grant minor but humiliating concessions, only to have it scotched at the last minute by Khomeini."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden 2006, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian rescue of hostages===
{{main|Canadian Caper}}
[[Image:ThanksCanada.JPG|{{largethumb}}|[[United States|Americans]] expressed gratitude for Canadian efforts to rescue American diplomats during the hostage crisis.]]
On the day the hostages were seized, six American diplomats evaded capture and remained in hiding at the home of the Canadian diplomat John Sheardown, under the protection of the Canadian ambassador, [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. In late 1979, the government of Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]] secretly issued an [[Order in council|Order in Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/MarleauMontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?DocId=1001&amp;Sec=Ch09&amp;Seq=5&amp;Language=E |title=Sittings of the House – Special or Unusual Sittings |website=Parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Canadian passports to be issued to some American citizens so that they could escape. In cooperation with the CIA, which used the cover story of a film project, two CIA agents and the six American diplomats boarded a [[Swissair]] flight to [[Zurich]], Switzerland, on January 28, 1980. Their rescue from Iran, known as the Canadian caper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art1.html |title=CIA Goes Hollywood: A Classic Case of Deception |last=Mendez |first=Antonio J. |authorlink=Tony Mendez |publisher=''[[Studies in Intelligence]]'' |date=Winter 1999–2000 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9k6tEwOfnyEC&amp;pg=PA304 |title=The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA |last=Mendez |first=Antonio J. |authorlink=Tony Mendez |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2000 |isbn=0060957913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Talk of the Town |work=The New Yorker |page=87 |date=May 12, 1980 |volume=56 |number=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was fictionalized in the 2012 film [[Argo (2012 film)|''Argo'']].

===Negotiations for release===
{{main|Iran hostage crisis negotiations}}

===Rescue attempts===
{{further|Operation Eagle Claw}}
{{Refimprove section |date=March 2009}}

====First rescue attempt====
[[Cyrus Vance]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], had argued against [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]'s, the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], push for a military solution to the crisis.&lt;ref name=NYTmag&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Douglas Brinkley]]|title=The Lives They Lived; Out of the Loop|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-out-of-the-loop.html|accessdate=3 May 2017|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=29 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vance, struggling with [[gout]], went to Florida on Thursday, April 10, 1980, for a long weekend.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt; On Friday Brzezinski held a newly scheduled meeting of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] where the president authorized [[Operation Eagle Claw]], a military expedition into Tehran to rescue the hostages.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  Deputy Secretary [[Warren Christopher]], who attended the meeting in Vance's place, did not inform Vance.&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;  Furious, Vance handed in his resignation on principle, calling Brzezinski "evil".&lt;ref name=NYTmag/&gt;

Late in the afternoon of April 24, 1980, eight [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion|RH‑53D]] helicopters flew from the aircraft carrier [[USS Nimitz|USS ''Nimitz'']] to a remote road serving as an airstrip in the [[Dasht-e Kavir|Great Salt Desert]] of Eastern Iran, near [[Tabas]]. They encountered severe dust storms that disabled two of the helicopters, which were traveling in complete [[radio silence]]. Early the next morning, the remaining six helicopters met up with several waiting [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft at a landing site and refueling area designated "Desert One".

At this point, a third helicopter was found to be unserviceable, bringing the total below the six deemed vital for the mission. The commander of the operation, Col. [[Charles Alvin Beckwith]], recommended that the mission be aborted, and his recommendation was approved by President Carter. As the helicopters repositioned themselves for refueling, one ran into a C‑130 tanker aircraft and crashed, killing eight U.S. servicemen and injuring several more.{{sfn|Holloway|1980|pp=9–10}}

In May 1980 the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] commissioned a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Operations]] review group of six senior military officers, led by Adm. [[James L. Holloway III]], to thoroughly examine all aspects of the rescue attempt. The group identified 23 issues that were significant in the failure of the mission, 11 of which it deemed major. The overriding issue was [[operational security]]—that is, keeping the mission secret so that the arrival of the rescue team at the embassy would be a complete surprise. This severed the usual relationship between pilots and weather forecasters; the pilots were not informed about the local dust storms. Another security requirement was that the helicopter pilots come from the same unit. The unit picked for the mission was a U.S. Navy mine-laying unit flying [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion|CH-53D Sea Stallions]]; these helicopters were considered the best suited for the mission because of their long range, large capacity, and compatibility with shipboard operations.

Two hours into the flight, the crew of helicopter No. 6 saw a warning light indicating that a main rotor might be cracked. They landed in the desert, confirmed visually that a crack had started to develop, and stopped flying in accordance with normal operating procedure. Helicopter No. 8 landed to pick up the crew of No. 6, and abandoned No. 6 in the desert without destroying it. The report by Holloway's group pointed out that a cracked helicopter blade could have been used to continue the mission and that its likelihood of catastrophic failure would have been low for many hours, especially at lower flying speeds.{{sfn|Holloway|1980|p=44}} The report found that the pilot of No. 6 would have continued the mission if instructed to do so.

When the helicopters encountered two [[dust storm]]s along the way to the refueling point, the second more severe than the first, the pilot of No. 5 turned back because the mine-laying helicopters were not equipped with [[terrain-following radar]]. The report found that the pilot could have continued to the refueling point if he had been told that better weather awaited him there, but because of the command for radio silence, he did not ask about the conditions ahead. The report also concluded that "there were ways to pass the information" between the refueling station and the helicopter force "that would have small likelihood of compromising the mission"—in other words, that the ban on communication had not been necessary at this stage.{{sfn|Holloway|1980|p=45}}

Helicopter No. 2 experienced a partial [[Hydraulics|hydraulic system]] failure but was able to fly on for four hours to the refueling location. There, an inspection showed that a hydraulic fluid leak had damaged a pump and that the helicopter could not be flown safely, nor repaired in time to continue the mission. Six helicopters was thought to be the absolute minimum required for the rescue mission, so with the force reduced to five, the local commander radioed his intention to abort. This request was passed through military channels to President Carter, who agreed.&lt;ref name="Holloway1980"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/hollowayrpt.htm#issue10 |year=1980 |last=Holloway |first=J. L., III |authorlink=James L. Holloway III |author2=Special Operations Review Group |title=[Iran Hostage] Mission Rescue Report |publisher=U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130502082348/http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/hollowayrpt.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the mission and its failure were made known publicly, Khomeini credited divine intervention on behalf of Islam, and his prestige skyrocketed in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, ''Iranians'', (2000), p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian officials who favored release of the hostages, such as President [[Bani Sadr]], were weakened. In America, President Carter's political popularity and prospects for being re-elected in 1980 were further damaged after a television address on April 25 in which he explained the rescue operation and accepted responsibility for its failure.

====Planned second attempt====
A second rescue attempt, planned but never carried out, would have used highly modified YMC-130H Hercules aircraft. Three aircraft, outfitted with rocket thrusters to allow an extremely short landing and takeoff in the [[Shahid Shiroudi Stadium|Shahid Shiroudi football stadium]] near the embassy, were modified under a rushed, super-secret program known as [[Operation Credible Sport]]. One crashed during a demonstration at [[Eglin Air Force Base]] on October 29, 1980, when its braking rockets were fired too soon. The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire, but all on board survived. After Carter lost the [[United States presidential election, 1980|presidential election]] in November, the project was abandoned.

The failed rescue attempt led to the creation of the [[160th SOAR]], a helicopter aviation Special Operations group.

With the completion of [[Iran hostage crisis negotiations|negotiations]], the hostages were released on January 20, 1981. That day, at the moment President Reagan completed his 20‑minute inaugural address after being [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|sworn in]], the 52 American hostages were released to U.S. personnel.&lt;ref name="Weisman A1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reagan Takes Oath as 40th President; Promises an "Era of National Renewal'—Minutes Later, 52 U.S. Hostages in Iran Fly to Freedom After 444-Day Ordeal|first=Steven R.|last=Weisman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1981|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0120.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1981/Iranian-Hostages-Released/12311754163167-2/ |title=Iranian Hostages Released – 1981 Year in Review – Audio |website=UPI.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are theories and conspiracy theories regarding why Iran postponed the release until that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/25/10826056/reagan-iran-hostage-negotiation |title=The Republican myth of Ronald Reagan and the Iran hostages, debunked |publisher=Vox |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.org/1987-october/did-iran-delay-hostages-release-to-ensure-reagan-s-election.html |title=Did Iran Delay Hostages Release To Ensure Reagan's Election? |publisher=WRMEA |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Neil A. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/15/world/new-reports-say-1980-reagan-campaign-tried-to-delay-hostage-release.html |title=New Reports Say 1980 Reagan Campaign Tried to Delay Hostage Release |location=IRAN |website=NYTimes.com |date=1991-04-15 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also: [[October Surprise conspiracy theory]])''  They were flown from Iran to Algeria as a symbolic gesture of appreciation for the Algerian government's help in resolving the crisis. The flight continued to [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] in West Germany and on to an Air Force hospital in [[Wiesbaden]], where former President Carter, acting as emissary, received them. After medical check-ups and debriefings, the hostages made a second flight to a refueling stop in [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon, Ireland]], where they were greeted by a large crowd. The ex-hostages were then flown  to [[Stewart Air National Guard Base]] in [[Newburgh (town), New York|Newburgh, New York]]. From Newburgh, they traveled by bus to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point and stayed at the [[Thayer Hotel]] for three days, receiving a heroes' welcome all along the route. Ten days after their release, they were given a [[ticker tape parade]] through the [[Canyon of Heroes]] in New York City.

==Aftermath==
===Iran–Iraq War===
The [[Iran–Iraq War|Iraqi invasion of Iran]] occurred less than a year after the embassy employees were taken hostage. The journalist [[Stephen Kinzer]] argues that the dramatic change in American–Iranian relations, from allies to enemies, helped embolden the Iraqi leader, [[Saddam Hussein]], and that the United States' anger with Iran led it to [[United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war|aid the Iraqis]] after the war turned against them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Inside Iran's Fury|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html|archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130419175811/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/iran-fury.html|dead-url = yes|archive-date = April 19, 2013|website = Smithsonian|accessdate = 2016-01-05|last = Kinzer|first = Stephen|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States supplied Iraq with, among other things, "helicopters and satellite intelligence that was used in selecting bombing targets." This assistance "deepened and widened anti-American feeling in Iran."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Consequences for Iran===

[[File:13 Aban (3).jpg|thumb|A protest in Tehran on November 4, 2015, against the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.]]
[[File:13 Aban (4).jpg|thumb|The November 2015 protest in Tehran.]]
The hostage-taking was unsuccessful for Iran in some respects. It lost international support for its war against Iraq, and the negotiated settlement was considered almost wholly favorable to the United States because it did not meet any of Iran's original demands.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution'', Keddie, Nikki, Yale University Press, 2003, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the crisis strengthened Iranians who had supported the hostage-taking. Anti-Americanism became even more intense.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians such as Khoeiniha and [[Behzad Nabavi]]&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, Daniel ''Reinventing Khomeini'', University of Chicago Press (2001), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; were left in a stronger position, while those associated with&amp;nbsp;– or accused of association with&amp;nbsp;– America were removed from the political picture. A Khomeini biographer, [[Baqer Moin]], described the crisis as "a watershed in Khomeini's life" that transformed him from "a cautious, pragmatic politician" into "a modern revolutionary single-mindedly pursuing a dogma". In Khomeini's statements, ''imperialism'' and ''liberalism'' were "negative words", while ''revolution'' "became a sacred word, sometimes more important than ''Islam''".&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Khomeini, (2000) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{Who|date=January 2016}} have suggested that the greatest benefit of the takeover of the American Embassy was the acquisition of intelligence contained within the embassy, including the identity of informants to the U.S. government, which the new Islamist government could use to remove potential dissenters and consolidate its gains.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The Iranian government commemorates the event every year with a demonstration at the embassy and the [[Flag desecration|burning of an American&amp;nbsp;flag]]. However, on November 4, 2009, prodemocracy protesters and reformists demonstrated in the streets of Tehran. When the authorities encouraged them to chant "death to America," the protesters instead chanted "death to the dictator" (referring to [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Iran's Supreme Leader]], Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]]) and other antigovernment slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/11/irans-prodemocracy-protesters-to-obama-with-us-or-against-us-what-a-difference-30-years-makes.html|title=Iran's pro-democracy protesters to Obama: With us or against us?

In 2000 the hostages and their families tried unsuccessfully to sue Iran under the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996|Antiterrorism Act]] of 1996. They originally won the case when Iran failed to provide a defense, but the State Department then tried to end the lawsuit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Seeking Damages From Iran, Ex-Marine Must Battle Bush Administration, Too|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/10/us/nation-challenged-former-hostage-seeking-damages-iran-ex-marine-must-battle-bush.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2002-02-10|access-date = 2016-01-05|issn = 0362-4331|first = Matthew L.|last = Wald}}&lt;/ref&gt; fearing that it would make international relations difficult. As a result, a federal judge ruled that no damages could be awarded to the hostages because of the agreement the United States had made when the hostages were freed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Judge Rules Iran Hostages Can't Receive Compensation|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/19/world/judge-rules-iran-hostages-can-t-receive-compensation.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2002-04-19|access-date = 2016-01-05|issn = 0362-4331|first = Matthew L.|last = Wald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former U.S. Embassy building is now used by Iran's government and affiliated groups. Since 2001 it has served as a museum to the revolution. Outside the door, there is a bronze model based on the [[Statue of Liberty]] on one side and a statue portraying one of the hostages on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = BBC NEWS {{!}} In pictures: Iran hostage crisis|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/04/middle_east_iran_hostage_crisis/html/12.stm|website = news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in 2006 that a group called the Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the Global Islamic Campaign had used the embassy to recruit "martyrdom seekers": volunteers to carry out operations against Western and [[Iran Israel relations|Israeli]] targets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian group seeks British suicide bombers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/19/iran.israel |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2008-05-10 | location=London | first=Robert | last=Tait}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad Samadi, a spokesman for the group, signed up several hundred volunteers in a few days.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
[[File:Iran hostage crisis memmorial.jpg|thumb|Iran hostage crisis memorial]]

===Diplomatic relations===

The United States and Iran broke off formal diplomatic relations over the hostage crisis. Iran selected Algeria as its [[protecting power]] in the United States, transferring the mandate to Pakistan in 1992. The United States selected Switzerland as its protecting power in Iran. Relations are maintained through the [[Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United States|Iranian Interests Section]] of the Pakistan Embassy and the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|U.S. Interests Section]] of the Swiss Embassy.

A small number of hostages were not connected to diplomatic staff. All were released by late 1981.
* Jerry Plotkin—American Businessman released January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/08/us/jerry-plotkin-62-who-spent-444-days-as-a-hostage-in-iran.html|title=Jerry Plotkin, 62, Who Spent 444 Days as a Hostage in Iran|first=|last=Ap|date=June 8, 1996|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hostages honored===
All State Department and CIA employees taken hostage received the [[State Department Award for Valor]]. Political Officer Michael J. Metrinko received two: one for his time as a hostage and another for his daring rescue of Americans who had been jailed in [[Tabriz]] months before the embassy takeover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Bowden]] ''[[Guests of the Ayatollah: The First Battle in America's War with Militant Islam|Guests of the Ayatollah]]'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military later awarded the 20 servicemen among the hostages the [[Defense Meritorious Service Medal]]. The only hostage serviceman not issued the medal was Staff Sgt Joseph Subic, Jr., who "did not behave under stress the way noncommissioned officers are expected to act"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E1D61138F932A35754C0A967948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Around the World; Former Iranian Hostage To Get Early Discharge | date=July 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, he cooperated with the hostage-takers, according to other hostages.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Mark ''Guests of the Ayatollah'', Grove Press, 2006, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Humanitarian Service Medal]] was awarded to the servicemen of Joint Task Force 1–79, the planning authority for Operation Rice Bowl/Eagle Claw, who participated in the rescue attempt.

The Air Force Special Operations component of the mission was given the Air Force Outstanding Unit award for performing their part of the mission flawlessly, including evacuating the Desert One refueling site under extreme conditions.

===Notable hostage-takers, guards, and interrogators===
* [[Abbas Abdi]]—reformist, journalist, self-taught sociologist, and social activist.
* [[Hamid Aboutalebi]]—former Iranian ambassador to the United Nations.
* [[Ebrahim Asgharzadeh]]—then a student; later an Iranian political activist and politician, member of [[Parliament of Iran|Parliament]] (1989–1993), and chairman of [[City Council of Tehran]] (1999–2003).
* [[Mohsen Mirdamadi]]—member of Parliament (2000–2004), head of [[Islamic Iran Participation Front]].
* [[Masoumeh Ebtekar]]—interpreter and spokeswoman for the student group that occupied the embassy; later a scientist, journalist, first female [[Vice President of Iran]], and head of Environment Protection Organization of Iran.
* [[Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha]]—spiritual leader of the hostage-takers.
* [[Hussein Sheikholeslam]]—then a student; later a member of Parliament and Iranian ambassador to Syria.

==October Surprise conspiracy theory==
{{further|October Surprise conspiracy theory|October surprise}}
Allegations that the Reagan administration negotiated a delay in the release of the hostages until after the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]] have been numerous but unproven. [[Gary Sick]], principal White House aide for Iran and the Persian Gulf on the Carter administration's [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], claimed in his book ''October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sick |first1=Gary |year=1991 |title=October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan. |publisher=Random House |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; that CIA Director [[William J. Casey|William Casey]] and possibly Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] went to Paris to negotiate such a delay. Many others have made the same allegations.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

* The [[Academy Award]]–winning movie ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' was based on the taking of hostages by Iranian revolutionaries. The movie was criticized for changing the story considerably, including by former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was Canadian. And the movie gives almost full credit to the American CIA. And with that exception, the movie is very good. But Ben Affleck's character in the film was ... only in Tehran a day and a half. And the main hero, in my opinion, was [[Kenneth D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3529">'''John D. Gartner''' is a psychologist and therapist in the U.S.

He graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in New Jersey and received his  Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Massachusetts and completed his post-doctoral training at New York Hospital - Cornell Medical School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John D Gartner Bio|url=http://www.johngartner.com/about.php|website=johngartner.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gartner is a therapist with a private practice in [[Baltimore]] and [[Manhattan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shrinks Battle Over Diagnosing Donald Trump|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/201701/shrinks-battle-over-diagnosing-donald-trump|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where he specialized in the treatment of borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder and depression.

== Fitness for Office of President Trump ==
Gartner collected in the first months of 2017 more than 25.000 signatures of mental health professionals on a petition, directed to the national opposition leader, Democratic Senator [[Chuck Schumer]].&lt;ref&gt; https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2017/02/19/psychologist-calls-on-colleagues-to-sign-petition-for-trumps-removal/#52fd90e264f3 &lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of April 2017 he was able to forward the petition with more than 41.000 signatures  of mental healthcare professionals to [[Washington D.C.]].

Core of the petition: ''My professional judgement is that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him  psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States.''
''And I respectfully request him be removed from office, according to article 3 of the 25th Amendment, and so on''.

According to Gartner, President Trump's mental handicaps are a mix of 1.[[narcissism]], 2. [[paranoia]]; 3.[[sociopathy]]; and 4. a dash of [[wikt:sadism|sadism]].

'''Left Alternative''' was a UK political party resulting from the split within [[Respect – The Unity Coalition]] in late 2007.

The party operated in [[England and Wales]] and was backed by the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP). Soon after the split, the electoral label '''Left List''' was adopted and this label faced its first major electoral test in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|London mayoral elections]] and [[London Assembly election, 2008|London Assembly elections]] on 1 May 2008. [[Lindsey German]], the Mayoral candidate, came seventh and in both the Mayoral and Assembly elections, Left List received less than 1% of the vote, well down on Respect's performance in 2004. The name Left Alternative was subsequently adopted.

==History==
Respect was created in January 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3788125.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; using the issue of the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] to mobilise its vote. Beyond this issue, it attempted to have a broad [[socialism|socialist]] agenda. Respect allows its members to hold membership of other political organisations and notably included the SWP. Respect's most high-profile figure has been [[George Galloway]], then [[Respect - The Unity Coalition|Respect]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bethnal Green and Bow]], who was expelled from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2003 for "bringing the party into disrepute".

===The crisis in Respect===
{{Main|Respect - The Unity Coalition#The split in Respect|l1=The split in Respect}}
In September 2007, Galloway wrote a letter to Respect's national council members saying that the party was "too disorganised" and "faced oblivion" unless it reformed its internal party management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themuslimweekly.com/fullstoryview.aspx?NewsID=215082B330A483E173B045F1&amp;MENUID=HOMENEWS&amp;DESCRIPTION=UK%20News Galloway slams own Respect party], ''[[The Muslim Weekly]]'', 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also criticised the amount of money spent on the Organising for Fighting Unions conference and on an intervention at the Pride London [[LGBT]] rights event.

The letter was the opening shot in a dispute in Respect initially between Galloway and his supporters (including founding member [[Salma Yaqoob]]) on one side, and supporters of the SWP on the other. However the arguments later began to affect all of the membership including those not in the SWP or close to Galloway or Yaqoob. In particular, Galloway called for the appointment of a National Organiser, who would support the National Secretary, [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]] (then an SWP member). The SWP perceived this to be an attempt to undermine John Rees who was the dominant voice for the SWP within Respect's leadership. A letter from their Central Committee stated: "The SWP believed that the post was created to undermine Respect National Secretary John Rees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/692/swp%20party%20notes.htm |title=From the SWP's Party Notes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018030211/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/692/swp%20party%20notes.htm |archivedate=18 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the dispute, the SWP expelled three members who sided with Galloway: [[Kevin Ovenden]] and [[Rob Hoveman]], who both worked for George Galloway, and Nick Wrack, who was nominated for the position of National Organiser.

On 3 November 2007, Galloway's side announced plans to hold a "[[Respect Renewal]]" conference on 17 November, the same day as the planned national conference of Respect. The Respect Renewal conference was an open event and organisers claim 350 people attended. This figure was disputed by [[Chris Harman]] in ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]''. The Respect national conference, which went ahead on the same day was attended by 270 delegates from 49 local branches and 17 student groups, as well as 90 observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harman|first=Chris|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=396&amp;issue=117|title=The Crisis in Respect|work=[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]|year=2008|accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linda Smith, Respect's national chair at the time of the split, has claimed: "The sectarianism and ‘control freak’ methods of the SWP have led us to a situation where Respect is irretrievably split."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://respectrenewal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20|title=Renewing Respect}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SWP has attributed the split to a shift to the right by George Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (placing election-winning above other principles). This, say the SWP leadership, led to attacks on the SWP as the most prominent left group in Respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swp.org.uk/respect_cc.php |title=The record: The Socialist Workers Party and Respect |author=SWP Central Committee Statement |date=3 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907150924/http://www.swp.org.uk/respect_cc.php |archivedate= 7 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left List emerges===
The [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] refused to take a side in the split and therefore continued to recognise Linda Smith as the Nominating Officer for Respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=467&amp;frmType=partydetail|title=Register of political parties: Respect—The Unity Coalition|accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that her signature is required for candidates wishing to use the electoral label "Respect" (and similar registered names) on ballot papers in UK elections. A letter from the Electoral Commission to Linda Smith on 23 January 2008, set out its position on the split, following confusion on the matter from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistunity.com/?p=1617|publisher=Socialist Unity|title=RESPECT—SWP can't use the name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the split, the side that included the SWP (but not Galloway or Linda Smith) nominated candidates in two district council by-elections. They could not use the name "Respect" on ballot papers without the signature of the nominating officer. Instead, both had no label on the ballot papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preston.gov.uk/elections/ElectionWard.asp?ward=94|title=Preston City Council Electoral Ward Nominees}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/index/council/elections/leyton-by-election/leyton-by-election-candidates.htm|title=Statement as to persons nominated|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070620191530/http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/index/council/elections/leyton-by-election/leyton-by-election-candidates.htm|archivedate=20 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This side in the Respect split announced that in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|London mayoral elections]] planned for 1 May 2008 it would stand [[Lindsey German]] for mayor (Respect's candidate in 2004 and chosen as Respect's candidate in 2007 prior to the schism) and candidates for the London Assembly, elected on the same date. It announced that its candidates would contest these elections under a new electoral label, the Left List, since Linda Smith had not allowed them to be listed on ballot papers as Respect candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=1833 |title=Respect's Left List launches GLA challenge |publisher=Respect—the Unity Coalition |accessdate=2008-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506072756/http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=1833 |archivedate= 6 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=818&amp;frmType=partydetail|title=Register of political parties: Left List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=14397|title=Why Respect is Standing as 'Left List' in London|accessdate=2008-03-17|publisher=[[Socialist Worker]]|date=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Left List contested every constituency and stood on the London-wide proportional representation list.
At the council elections on 1 May 2008, the Left List also contested seats as the Left List or the Left Party, Maxine Bowler in Burngreave, Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=1822 |title=Respect announces Left List for Mayoral and GLA elections |publisher=[[Respect Party|Respect - The Unity Coalition]] |date=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322212630/http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=1822 |archivedate=22 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Respect Renewal]] stood in the City and East London constituency as well as contesting the London-wide list. George Galloway headed the London-wide party list, and Respect Renewal candidates stood under the name Respect (George Galloway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/211/1/ |title=We Can Win In East London This May |publisher=[[Respect Renewal]] |date=2008-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327181236/http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/211/1 |archivedate=27 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.respectrenewal.org/images/stories/downloads/respectspecialeditionmar08.pdf|format=PDF|title=Respect Newspaper Special Edition|publisher=[[Respect Renewal]]|date=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both factions of Respect suffered as a result and together failed to reach the previous number of votes.

=== Left Alternative ===
The organisation's website began to display the title Left Alternative in late June 2008. On 10 September 2008 John Rees and Lindsey German resigned from the Left Alternative National Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecommune.wordpress.com/2008/09/10/rees-and-german-resign-from-left-alternative-leadership/|title=rees and german resign from left alternative leadership|publisher=The Commune|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SWP dumps John Rees"&gt;[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/737/swpdumps.html SWP dumps John Rees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925044309/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/737/swpdumps.html |date=25 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most elected councillors who had joined Left List at the time of the split from Respect subsequently defected to other parties, mainly Labour, over the course of 2008.&lt;ref name="SWP dumps John Rees"/&gt; In 2008, one Left List councillor defected to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In June of that year, the three remaining Left List councillors in Tower Hamlets, including the Chair and Nominating Officer of the Left List, defected to the Labour Party as did one Respect Renewal councillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/content/towerhamlets/advertiser/news/story.aspx?brand=ELAOnline&amp;category=news&amp;tBrand=northlondon24&amp;tCategory=newsela&amp;itemid=WeED24%20Jun%202008%2019%3A44%3A39%3A473|title= New blow for Galloway as four more Respect members defect}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/search/story.aspx?brand=ELAOnline&amp;category=News&amp;itemid=WeED14%20Feb%202008%2014:33:40:697&amp;tBrand=ELAOnline&amp;tCategory=search|title=Galloway defector signs up to join Tory party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation's website ceased operation in mid-2009. The party deregistered from the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] Register of Political Parties in April 2010.

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J. Richard Piper, ''Ideologies and Institutions: American Conservative and Liberal Governance Prescriptions Since 1933'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u93Mj3A-tH8C&amp;pg=PA110 pp. 110–111], {{ISBN|0847684598}}, {{ISBN|978-0847684595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting [[civil society]] through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/getting-libertarianism-right Getting Libertarianism Right].

== Philosophy ==
For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|title=The Rise of the City: 1878-1898|publisher=The Academy of Political Science|date=September 1933|orig-year=1st pub. 1933|pages=454–456|chapter=Vol. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Randall|title=Sandino's Daughters: Testimonies of Nicaraguan Women in Struggle|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 14, 2018|orig-year=1st pub. 1995|pages=ii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W.

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker. Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/mafaldo1.html|title=The Conservative Case for Ron Paul|last=Mafaldo|first=Lucas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] have been described as combining libertarian and conservative "[[small government]]" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31434">A corporate collapse typically involves the [[insolvency]] or [[bankruptcy]] of a major business enterprise. A corporate scandal involves alleged or actual unethical behavior by people acting within or on behalf of a corporation. Many recent corporate collapses and scandals have involved false or inappropriate [[accounting]] of some sort (see list at [[accounting scandals]]).
&lt;!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER/CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER --&gt;

==List of a few major corporate collapses==
The following list of corporations involved major collapses, through the risk of job losses or size of the business, and meant entering into [[insolvency]] or [[bankruptcy]], or being [[nationalised]] or requiring a non-market loan by a government.

A  cult of personality uses various techniques, including [[mass media]], [[propaganda]], [[the arts]], [[patriotism]], and government-organized demonstrations and rallies to create an heroic image, of a leader, often inviting worshipful behavior through uncritical flattery and praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adrian Teodor|last=Popan|title=The ABC of sycophancy : structural conditions for the emergence of dictators' cults of personality |date=August 2015 |doi=10.15781/T2J960G15 |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/46763/POPAN-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf |accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=en |id=|hdl=2152/46763|pages=196–213|website=The University of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] of the ruling [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|communist party]] served as [[President of Afghanistan]] from 1978 to 1979, when he told people to refer to him titles such as the "Great Leader".&lt;ref&gt;''Russia's Muslim Frontiers. New Directions in Cross-Cultural Analysis'' by Dale F. Eickelman, 1993.

Long time ruler of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist Albania]] [[Enver Hoxha]] had what the [[OECD]] called "an overwhelming cult of personality and an ultra-centralised, authoritarian form of decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reviews of National Policies for Education:South Eastern Europe|author=[[OECD]]|year=2003|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=9789264100725|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1jWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoxha was widely portrayed as a genius who commented on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Statues were erected in cities. Each schoolbook required quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The ruling party of the time, the [[Party of Labour of Albania]], honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  When Hoxha died in 1985, [[Ramiz Alia]] took power. [[Robert D. McFadden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Alia's policies of liberalization were "too little, too late", and the country descended into [[Albanian Civil War|violent anarchy]]. Alia served one year in prison for corruption, but the anarchy prevented further charges from being brought against the former Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/world/europe/ramiz-alia-former-ruler-of-albania-dies-at-85.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Ramiz Alia, an Enforcer for a Dictator and Later Ruler of Albania, Dies at 85|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentina==
{{See also|Peronism}}

[[Juan Domingo Perón]], elected three times as [[President of Argentina]], and his second wife, [[Eva Duarte de Perón]], were immensely popular among many of the Argentine people, and to this day they are still considered icons by the leading [[Justicialist Party]]. Followers of the Peróns praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and dignify labor, while their detractors considered them [[demagogue]]s and dictators. To achieve their political goals, the Peronists had to unite around the head of state. As a result, a personality cult developed around both Perón and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Education in Argentina'', 1946-1962, by Mónica Esti Rein; trans by Martha Grenzeback.

==Brazil==
During the [[Vargas Era]], the Brazilian Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP) promoted a [[Messiah]]-style image of Brazilian dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] by broadcasting propaganda every day and by showing him as "saviour of the Brazilian people".

In recent years there has been a growing cult of personality in modern Brazil around the former Brazilian president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], promoted by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] and more recently, around [[Jair Bolsonaro]], promoted by right-wing militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/reinaldo/culto-a-personalidade-politicos-pagam-r-20-para-ter-fotomontagem-com-lula/|title=Culto à personalidade: políticos pagam R$ 20 para ter fotomontagem com Lula {{!}} Reinaldo Azevedo {{!}} VEJA.com|work=VEJA.com|access-date=2017-11-20|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
[[File:Chiang KaiShek Portrait Tiananmen Beijing.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Portrait of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] on [[Tiananmen]] before the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist takeover]]]]
A personality cult in the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] was centered on the [[Kuomintang]] party founder [[Sun Yat-sen]], and his successor, Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The personality cult of Chiang Kai-shek went further after the republican government fled to [[Taiwan]]. He was usually referred to as "Lord Chiang" (蔣公) in public and a [[Tai tou|space between the characters of his name and title]] was required in printed materials. Articles in textbooks and songs glorifying him were commonly seen in Taiwan before 1987.
[[File:Mao Zedong Statue in North China.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Statue of [[Mao Zedong]] in modern [[China]]]]
The [[People's Republic of China]] under [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] can also be considered a cult of personality,{{according to whom|date=March 2017}} the most obvious symbol of which is his massive portrait situated on the north end of [[Tiananmen Square]]. The [[culture of the People's Republic of China]] before 1978 was highly influenced by the personality cult of Mao Zedong{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} which reached its peak during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Mao was referred to as "the great leader Chairman Mao" (伟大领袖毛主席) in public and he was entitled "the great leader, the great supreme commander, the great teacher and the great helmsman" (伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的导师、伟大的舵手) in Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5QbQpQTegwC&amp;pg=PA421|title=A glossary of political terms of the People's Republic of China |year=1995|location=|page=639|accessdate=2012-08-01|isbn=9789622016156|author1=Li|first1=Gucheng}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badges and books of his quotations were mass-produced. Most people were required to recite the Quotations of Chairman Mao and printed material at that time usually quoted Mao's words in bold as well as in the preface. The Loyalty dance (忠字舞) was also introduced during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1976.

The cult of personality continued for a short time after Mao's death. His successor, Chairman [[Hua Guofeng]] also practiced the cult of personality{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and he was referred to as "the brilliant leader Chairman Hua" (英明领袖华主席). [[Chinese economic reform|Reforms]] in 1978 led to a deconstruction of Mao's cult status and the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and his successors such as [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Hu Jintao]] were averse to a [[:zh:毛澤東崇拜|Mao cult]] of personality style of rule lest it recreate the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.

The rise and consolidation of power under [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] has given way to a return to Mao-style personality cult centered around General Secretary Xi in [[Media of China|state media]] and [[Propaganda in the People's Republic of China|propaganda]] messages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21618882-cult-personality-growing-around-chinas-president-what-will-he-do-his-political|title=The power of Xi Jinping.

==Colombia==
Former president [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]] became the center of a Cult of Personality in [[Colombia]] in the later years of the country's armed conflict. Supporters refer to him as "The Great Colombian" in spite of his family's ties to the [[Medellín Cartel]] and the numerous human rights scandals that marred his presidency. After Uribe failed to amend the constitution that would allow him to stay in power for a third term in 2010, he founded a political party that uses the former president's silhouette as logo. The party's attempts to be named after its "only leader" were thwarted in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/opinion/articulo/fanatismo-por-alvaro-uribe/524937|title=La deificación del senador Uribe|work=Semana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuba==
Although it was reported that one of [[Fidel Castro]]'s dying wishes was not to have buildings or streets named after him, and that statues of him not be erected, in order to avoid a cult of personality, it is generally believed{{cn|date=October 2018}} that such a cult had already developed by the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Bamat, Joseph (December 5, 2018) [http://www.france24.com/en/20161205-cuba-fidel-castro-cult-personality-last-battle "Is Castro's battle to avoid a personality cult destined to fail?"] ''[[France 24]]''.  Quote: "The declaration came as a shock to many in and outside Cuba, especially because Fidel Castro already enjoys a cult-like following in many parts of the world. In Africa he is seen as a key player in the continent's anti-colonial and anti-apartheid movements. In Latin America, he is often simply referred to as Fidel – his first name enough to invoke a towering figure who proudly defied Washington for decades and outlived 10 US presidents."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azor, Marlene (August 12, 2016) [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cults_of_personality&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9 "Fidel Castro and the Cult of Personality"] ''Havana Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, Juan Reinaldo with Gylden, Axel (2015) ''The Double Life of Fidel Castro: My 17 Years as Personal Bodyguard to El Lider'' New York: Macmillan.

==Egypt==
The Egyptian state practiced a Cult of Personality around [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] during his rule. It has been alleged that the [[Egypt]]ian media has created a personality cult around the current [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misstated Excerpt of Times Article Offers Fresh Take on President Sisi of Egypt - NYTimes.com|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/world/middleeast/misstated-excerpt-of-a-times-article-offers-fresh-take-on-egyptian-president.html|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/personality-cult-built-around-egypts-top-general|title=Personality cult built around Egypt's top general|work=The Big Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.htm|title=Abdel Fattah el-Sisi News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equatorial Guinea==
The first president of [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Francisco Macías Nguema]], was the centre of an extreme personality cult, perhaps fueled by his consumption of copious amounts of ''[[bhang]]''&lt;ref name="afroarticles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/Article/Macias-Nguema--Ruthless-and-bloody-dictator/117291|title=Macias Nguema: Ruthless and bloody dictator|publisher=Afroarticles.com|accessdate=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104035212/http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/Article/Macias-Nguema--Ruthless-and-bloody-dictator/117291|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[iboga]]'',&lt;ref name=Pariah&gt;{{cite web |title=The Pariah President: Teodoro Obiang is a brutal dictator responsible for thousands of deaths.

The island of Fernando Pó had its name Africanized after him to Masie Ngueme Biyogo Island; upon his overthrow in 1979, its name was again changed to [[Bioko]]. The capital, Santa Isabel, had its name changed to [[Malabo]]. In 1978, he changed the [[national motto]] of the [[Coat of arms of Equatorial Guinea]] to "There is no other God than Marcias Nguema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/article.php?id=117291 |title=Macias Nguema: Ruthless and bloody dictator |publisher=Afroarticles.com |accessdate=2014-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313200255/http://afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/article.php?id=117291 |archivedate=2016-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has been continued by [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] who has been accused of building his own personality cult. As evidence of this, in July 2003, the state-operated radio declared that Obiang was "the country's [[God (word)|god]]" and that he had "all power over men and things."  It added that the president was "in permanent contact with the Almighty" and that he "can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to [[hell]]."  He personally made similar comments in 1993. Macías had also proclaimed himself a god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Equatorial Guinea's 'God' |accessdate=1 November 2007 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=26 July 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3098007.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obiang has encouraged his cult of personality by ensuring that public speeches end with well-wishing for himself rather than end with well-wishing for the republic. Many important buildings have a presidential lodge, many towns and cities have streets commemorating Obiang's coup against Macías, and many people wear clothes with his face printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;Maass, Peter (2005) [http://motherjones.com/politics/2005/01/obiang-equatorial-guinea-oil-riggs "A Touch of Crude"] ''Mother Jones'' 30 (1):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;48–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverstein"&gt;Silverstein, Ken (2010) [http://www.petroleumworld.com/sati10061901.htm "Saturday Lagniappe: UNESCO for Sale: Dictators allowed to buy their own prizes, for the right price"] ''Petroleumworld'', originally published by ''Harpers Magazine'', 2 June 2010, archived at [http://www.freezepage.com/1287676231QTNSPIRBQH?url=http://www.petroleumworld.com/sati10061901.htm Freezepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his predecessor and other African dictators such as [[Idi Amin]] and [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Obiang has assigned to himself several creative titles.

India's first [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was known to foster a personality cult around himself.{{According to whom|date=June 2017}} Many leaders opposed Nehru's style of functioning, his economic policies and his [[Socialism|socialist]] agenda.

==Indonesia==
During the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy era]], there was a personality cult around [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]]. He was made [[president for life]] by the [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPRS]] in 1963. His ideological writings on Manipol-USDEK and NASAKOM became mandatory subjects in Indonesian schools and universities, while his speeches were to be memorized and discussed by all students. All newspapers, the only radio station ([[Radio Republik Indonesia|RRI]], government-run), and the only television station ([[TVRI]], also government-run) were made into "tools of the revolution" and functioned to spread Sukarno's messages. Sukarno developed a [[personality cult]], with the capital of newly acquired [[Western New Guinea|West Irian]] renamed to [[Jayapura|Sukarnapura]] and the highest peak in the country was renamed from Carstensz Pyramid to [[Puncak Jaya|Puntjak Sukarno (Sukarno Peak)]].

Sukarno was popularly referred to as ''bung'' ("comrade"), and he painted himself as a man of the people who carried the aspirations of Indonesia and dared to take on the West.&lt;ref name="Witton_28"&gt;{{harvp|Witton|2003|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some other titles were given to him, like "Great Leader of the Revolution".  When [[Suharto]] became president, Sukarno's cult and roles were erased by the new government in [[de-Soekarnoization]] policy.

The [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government created some propaganda, in which President Suharto is depicted as the "main hero" during the [[General Offensive of 1 March 1949|1949 General Offensive]], as well as during the [[30 September Movement]]. He was also granted the title of ''Bapak Pembangunan'' (Father of Development) in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Rock (2003), p.3&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1998, four months after the [[fall of Suharto]], Information Minister [[Yunus Yosfiah]] declared that the ''[[Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI]]'' film would no longer be compulsory viewing material, reasoning that it was an attempt to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto as the protagonist.

==Iraq==

As a sign of his consolidation of power as [[Iraq]]'s dictator, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s personality cult pervaded Iraqi society. He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-09-05/news/9003140468_1_saddam-hussein-iraqis-arab|title=Hussein`s Dark Side Enshrouded|last=Franklin|first=Stephen|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=September 5, 1990|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools and classrooms, airports, and shops, as well as on all denominations of Iraqi currency (the [[Iraqi dinar|dinar]]). Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the [[Bedouin]], the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even appeared in [[Kurdish clothing]], but he also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout [[Muslim]], wearing a full headdress and robe, praying towards [[Mecca]], but most often he was depicted wearing a military uniform.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Göttke, F. ''Toppled'', Rotterdam: Post Editions, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An international airport, a university, a bridge, a dam, a stadium, an art centre, a street, an urban district (Saddam-city), a rocket and other objects were named after him. Saddam even had many well-decorated (by golden flush toilets) palaces for his own private use. People brought many gifts to Saddam that were collected in a special palace. According to his order, every tenth brick of reconstructed ancient buildings (including [[Nebuchadnezzar]]'s palace) was marked with his name or signature. His biography and his literary works were required reading in schools and Ba'ath party functioneers examined students' knowledge of them.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} Many written songs, novels, scientific and propaganda articles were devoted to him. State TV was broadcast with his image in the background and a mosque at the corner of the screen and it very often showed him, or his hands being kissed by children and other people.

After the fall of his regime, made visible by the toppling of his statue on Firdous Square in Baghdad on April 9, 2003, all statues of Saddam were destroyed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; All other aspects of his cult were dissolved as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2009/04/saddam-husseins/|title=Saddam Hussein's Statue of Limitations|last=Sher|first=Lauren|work=[[ABC News]]|date=April 9, 2009|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==

[[File:Propaganda.JPG|thumb|160px|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] in a poster promoted by fascist [[propaganda]] with the motto: "Win and we shall win"]]
The cult of [[Il Duce]] of fascist Italy [[Benito Mussolini]] was in many respects the unifying force of the fascist regime, acting as a common denominator for various political groups and social classes in both the fascist party and the wider Italian society. A basic slogan proclaimed that Mussolini was always right ({{lang-it|Il Duce ha sempre ragione}}). Endless publicity revolved around him. He was generally portrayed in a ''[[Machismo|macho]]'' manner, although he could also appear as a [[Polymath|Renaissance man]], a military man, a family man, or even as a [[Commoner|common man]]. This reflected his presentation as a universal man, expert in all subjects; a light was left on his office long after he was asleep as a part of fascist propaganda in order to present him as an [[insomnia]]c owing to his driven to work nature. Mussolini himself oversaw which photographs could appear, rejecting some, for instance, because he was not sufficiently prominent in a group. Legends of Mussolini defying death during the [[First World War]] and surviving assassination attempts were circulated in order to give the dictator a mythical, immortal aura. In addition to depicting Mussolini as being chosen by God, the regime presented him as having omnipotent, godlike or superhuman powers. His image proclaimed that he had improved the Italian people morally, materially, and spiritually. Even before his seizure of power, he was proclaimed the Duce in song. The [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|war on Ethiopia]] was presented as a revival of the [[Roman Empire]], with Mussolini as [[Augustus]].

With the entry of media [[tycoon]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]] into [[Italian politics]] in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], some critics claimed that a new kind of cult of personality was in place, favored by Berlusconi's three national television networks and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/06/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-varie-2/silvio-canzoni/silvio-canzoni.html|title="Silvio forever sarà, Silvio è genialità" il culto della personalità diventa canzone - Politica - Repubblica.it|work=repubblica.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the hymn of Berlusconi's movements [[Forza Italia]] and [[People of Freedom]] was ''Meno male che Silvio c'è'', literally "Thank goodness for Silvio".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|WXf-YbsSh0Y|Meno male che Silvio c'è video ufficiale inno campagna PDL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100passijournal.info/20-anni-fa-la-discesa-in-campo/|title=Berlusconi: vent'anni fa la "discesa in campo"|work=100 passi journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, Berlusconi often described himself as the [[Jesus Christ]] of Italian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4707368.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Berlusconi says 'I am like Jesus'|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874126,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes | date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attitudes were seen by public opinion as clear examples of the new political style that Berlusconi brought into [[Italy]], focused on the leader's [[charisma]], cult of personality and media domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.giovani.it/politica/118744-culto-personalita-italia.html|title=Giovani.it|work=giovani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silvio Berlusconi was [[Prime Minister of Italy]] for three terms and four governments. He governed the country for a total of almost ten years (less than one year in 1994–1995; five years in 2001–2006; and three and a half years in 2008–2011).

==Kazakhstan==
President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] is the subject of a state sponsored personality cult in [[Kazakhstan]], where he has assumed the title "Leader of the Nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lilis|first1=Joanna|title=Kazakhstan's Nazarbayev Cult Hijacks Winter Fun|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/67954|website=www.eurasianet.org|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kazakhstan's new holiday boosts Nazarbayev's personality cult|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/01/kazakhstan-new-holiday-boosts-nazarbayev-personality-cult/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laos==
A cult of personality is centered around the founders of the [[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]], [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] and the less prominent [[Prince Souphanouvong]] since their deaths in the early 1990s as there were no personality cults bestowed to them during their time in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/world/laos-capital-defies-time-and-change.html|title=Laos Capital Defies Time And Change|last=Kamm|first=Henry|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1995-08-06|accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaysone's portrait is displayed on public government buildings as well as on [[Laotian Kip]] bills. There is a museum built in [[Vientiane]] in order to honor Kaysone's life. Statues are also erected in his honor. [[Souphanouvong]]'s name and face are also seen in memorials, museums, and statues all across Laos, with a university being named after him in [[Luang Prabang]]. Due to Souphanouvong's past position as only a figurehead president and leader of the communist [[Pathet Lao]] movement with Kaysone holding the real power over Laos, the display of Souphanouvong's personality cult are seen with much lesser prominence than Kaysone.

==Libya==

A cult of personality devoted to Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] existed in [[Libya]] [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|during his rule]].{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} His face appeared on a wide variety of items, including postage stamps, watches, and school satchels. Quotations from ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'' appeared on a wide variety of places, from street walls to airports and even on pens, and they were also put to [[pop music]] for public release.

Gaddafi claimed that he disliked the personality cult surrounding him, but he tolerated it because the Libyan people adored him.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that he was "a [[Populism|populist]] at heart".{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} Throughout Libya, crowds of supporters would turn up to public events at which he appeared; described as "spontaneous demonstrations" by the government, there are recorded instances of groups being coerced or paid to attend.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=16}}

He was typically late to public events, and he would sometimes not show up at all.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=17}} Although Bianco thought that he had a "gift for oratory",{{Sfn|Bianco|1975|p=7}} he was considered a poor orator by biographers Blundy and Lycett.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=18}} Biographer [[Daniel Kawczynski]] noted that Gaddafi was famous for his "lengthy, wandering" speeches,{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=191}} which typically involved criticizing [[Israel]] and the U.S.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=17}}

He inherited, however, a few titles such as 'Great Sun of the 21st century,' 'Marshal,' or his father's title 'Great Leader' [widaehan ryŏngdoja].

In the [[Philippines]], many local politicians engage in some sort of cult of personality. The most famous are those of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who was dictator from 1972 to 1986 and the [[Aquino family]]. They are often branded as "epalitiko" by the media, which is a contraction of the words ''epal'' (slang for "attention-grabber"), and ''pulítiko'' ("politician"). They put their images and their names on billboards of government projects. They also print tarpaulins, usually with their images in order to establish a sense of connection with their constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/763279/bishop-wants-anti-epal-bill-cover-politicians-holiday-greetings|title=Bishop wants anti-'epal' bill to cover politicians' holiday greetings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journal.com.ph/index.php/news/national/57283-luistro-has-no-problem-with-epal-politicians |title=Luistro has no problem with 'epal' politicians &amp;#124; National |publisher=Journal.com.ph |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906195147/http://www.journal.com.ph/index.php/news/national/57283-luistro-has-no-problem-with-epal-politicians |archivedate=2013-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=VERA Files |url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/blogs/the-inbox/posters-epal-politicians-ordered-removed-052148943.html |title=Posters of 'epal' politicians ordered removed &amp;#124; The Inbox - Yahoo!

==Poland==
{{Main article|Józef Piłsudski's cult of personality}}
A cult of personality developed in [[Poland]] around the figure of [[Józef Piłsudski]], a Polish military commander and politician, starting from the [[interwar period]] and continuing after his death in 1935 until the present day. During the interwar period, Piłsudski's personality cult was propagated by the state media, which described him as a masterful strategist and a political visionary, and associated him with his role in regaining Polish independence in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and his leadership in the ensuing [[Polish–Soviet War]]. It has survived decades of repression, particularly during the era of [[People's Republic of Poland|communist rule]].

In modern Poland, Piłsudski is recognized as an important and largely positive figure in [[History of Poland|Polish history]]. [[Polish Independence Day]] is commemorated on November 11, the date when Piłsudski assumed power in Poland after the First World War.
The [[Law and Justice]] party builds the cult of the deceased  president [[Lech Kaczyński]]

[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena in 1986]]
In 1986 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter, [[David Binder (journalist)|David Binder]] stated that [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian]] dictator [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] presided over "a cult of personality that has equaled, or even surpassed, those of [[Stalin's Russia]], [[Mao's China]] and [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/magazine/the-cult-of-ceausescu.html|title=The Cult of Ceausescu|last=Binder|first=David|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 30, 1986|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the personality cult surrounding Kim Il-sung in North Korea, it started with the 1971 [[July Theses]] which reversed the liberalization of the 1960s and imposed a strict nationalist ideology. Initially, the cult of personality was only focused on Ceaușescu himself; however, by the early 1980s, his wife [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena]] was also a focus of the cult even to the extent that she got credit for scientific achievements which she could never have accomplished. It remained in force until the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|overthrow of the regime in 1989]] and the couple's execution.

{{quote|Comrades, the cult of the individual acquired such monstrous size chiefly because Stalin himself, using all conceivable methods, supported the glorification of his own person.... One of the most characteristic examples of Stalin's self-glorification and of his lack of even elementary modesty is the edition of his Short Biography, which was published in 1948.

This book is an expression of the most dissolute flattery, an example of making a man into a godhead, of transforming him into an infallible sage, "the greatest leader", "sublime strategist of all times and nations". Finally no other words could be found with which to lift Stalin up to the heavens.

We need not give here examples of the loathsome adulation filling this book. All we need to add is that they all were approved and edited by Stalin personally and some of them were added in his own handwriting to the draft text of the book.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news | title = The Cult of the Individual | url = https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/26/greatspeeches2 | accessdate = 2012-09-02 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nikita | last=Khrushchev | date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some authors (e.g., [[Alexander Zinovyev]]) have argued that [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s rule was also characterized by a cult of personality, though unlike Stalin, Brezhnev did not initiate large-scale persecutions in the country. One of the aspects of Leonid Brezhnev's cult of personality was his obsession with titles, rewards and decorations, leading to his inflated decoration with medals, orders and so on.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. http://oldgazette.ru/kopravda/21021978/01-1.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This was often ridiculed by the ordinary people and led to the creation of many [[Russian political jokes#Brezhnev|political jokes]].

Some journalists and Russian oppositionists argue that there is now a cult of personality around [[Vladimir Putin]] (see also [[Putinism]]). Currently, one-fourth of the Russian population believes that a cult of personality reminiscent of Soviet Union-era leaders has developed around Vladimir Putin, while another thirty percent believed that there were increasing signs of a personality cult surrounding Putin.

A cult of personality surrounded [[Francisco Franco]] during his [[Francoist Spain|Falangist regime]]. During his regime, he was depicted like a [[King of Spain|king]], for example, he wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the king), resided in the royal [[Pardo Palace]], appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were Jefe del Estado (Head of State) and ''Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles'' ([[Generalissimo]] of the Spanish Armed Forces), he was referred to as ''Caudillo de España por la gracia de Dios,'' ([[By the Grace of God]], the Leader of Spain). ''Por la Gracia de Dios'' is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], and it had only been used by monarchs before Franco used it himself.

In Turkey, founder of the Turkish Republic [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] is commemorated by a myriad of memorials throughout the country, such as the [[Atatürk International Airport]] in Istanbul, the [[Atatürk Bridge]] over the [[Golden Horn]] (Haliç), the [[Atatürk Dam]], and [[Atatürk Olympic Stadium|Atatürk Stadium]]. His titles include Great Leader (Ulu Önder),  Eternal Commander (Ebedî Başkomutan), Head Teacher (Baş Öğretmen), and Eternal Chief (Ebedî Şef). Atatürk statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by the Turkish Government, and most towns have their own memorial to him. His face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey; his portrait can be seen in all public buildings, in all schools and classrooms, on all school textbooks, on all [[Turkish lira]] banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Faces of the State: Secularism and Public Life in Turkey|last=Navaro-Yashin|first=Yael|year=2002|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0-691-08845-4|pages=196–99|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the exact time of his death, on every 10 November, at 09:05, most vehicles and people in the country's streets pause for one minute in remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kiss, Bow, Or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries|last=Morrison|first=Terry|author2=Conaway, Wayne A.|year=1994|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-55850-444-3|url=|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, the [[s:tr:5816 sayılı kanun|Turkish Parliament issued a law (5816)]] outlawing [[s:tr:5816 sayılı kanun#1.1|insults to his reminiscence]] ({{lang-tr|hatırasına alenen hakaret}}) or [[s:tr:5816 sayılı kanun#1.2|destruction of objects]] representing him, which is still in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turkey: Terrorism, Civil Rights, and the European Union|last=Yonah|first=Alexander|year=2007|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-44163-3|url=|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihbarweb.org.tr|title=İhbar Web |publisher=İhbar Web |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created to denounce the websites that violate this law, and the Turkish government as of 2011 has filters in place to block websites deemed to contain materials insulting to his memory.

A number of scholarly papers and peer-reviewed articles have assessed the personality cult that some claim has developed around U.S. president [[Donald Trump]]. One is in a paper that appeared in the 2016 [[American Political Science Association]] Annual Meeting. In the paper, Sarah Oates, from the [[University of Maryland]] [[Philip Merrill College of Journalism]], and Wendy W. Moe, from the [[University of Maryland]] [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]], discussed the subject broadly and then stated that "during the 2016 Presidential primaries, the 'cult of personality' candidate, Trump, won the primary."&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2830195 ''Donald Trump and the 'Oxygen of Publicity': Branding, Social Media, and Mass Media in the 2016 Presidential Primary Elections.''] Sarah Oates and Wendy W. Moe. [[American Political Science Association]]. 25 August 2016. p.21. Accessed 3 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is in a book by [[University of Dayton]] distinguished professor of history [[Larry Schweikart]] and political commentator and author [[Joel Pollak]]. In their book, ''How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution'', they state that "some conservatives looked forward to Trump's defeat as a chance to rid the GOP of the insufficiently conservative insurgents who were bringing it to defeat by choosing a candidate who was a mere reality-show Hollywood celebrity, a lifetime liberal who was hijacking their party and their cause with a vain cult of personality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PWvYDQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT6 ''How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution.''] [[Joel Pollak]] and [[Larry Schweikart]]. Regnery Publishing. 2017. p.6. Accessed 3 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A third was written by [[Ethnology|ethnologist]]s Jonathan Rosa and Yarimar Bonilla who wrote, "although we do not minimize the devastating impact that [Trump] administration's policies will have, or the new president's ominous behavior, we are wary of exceptionalizing the current moment. Our goal is thus to deprovincialize Trump, that is, to locate his election within broader historical, political, and economic assemblages of which it is but one part."..."This effort might include [studying] Trump's [[xenophobia]], [[bombast]], and cult of personality, reminiscent of leaders in South Africa, Gambia, Uganda, Libya, and Zimbabwe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/amet.12468 | volume=44 | issue=2 | title=Deprovincializing Trump, decolonizing diversity, and unsettling anthropology | year=2017 | journal=American Ethnologist | pages=201–208 [201] | last1 = Rosa | first1 = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, stressing Trumps's own actions towards strengthening his own cult of personality, [[University of London|University of London U.S. Centre on American Politics and Policy]]'s Daniel Kato noted that "according to [[political theorist]] [[Hannah Arendt]]'s thinking Trump may yet hunker down, drawing strength from the resistance to him, and continue to consolidate his cult of personality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2017/02/08/political-philosophy-suggests-that-trump-will-either-double-down-on-his-behaviour-or-eventually-give-in-to-institutional-opposition/ ''Political philosophy suggests that Trump will either double down on his behavior or eventually give in to institutional opposition.''] Daniel Kato.

According to Tomas Straka of [[Andres Bello University]], Chávez's cult of personality began following the [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts]] which Chávez led, with Straka explaining that some Venezuelans "saw no solution to their most fundamental problems and they saw in Chávez a savior, or an avenger of those groups that had no hope".&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; Since the beginning of Chávez's tenure in 1999, the Venezuelan government manipulated the Venezuelan public with social programs depicting him as a great leader for the people.&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; The struggles that Chávez endured throughout his presidency, such as the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]], also drew compassion from his followers which boosted his support.&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; By the time of Chávez's death, speculation about potential Chavista reactions to his death were compared to the sorrow felt by those in [[North Korea]] who mourned the death of [[Kim Jong-il]],&lt;ref name=ABCcult&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rueda|first1=Manuela|title=The Cult Following of Venezuela's Hugo Chávez|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/venezuelas-hugo-chavez-cult-created/story?id=18186070|accessdate=11 December 2015|agency=[[ABC News]]|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one scholar of Latin America from the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], Juan Pablo Lupi, stating that the creation of Chávez's cult of personality was "very well-staged, all this process of myth-making and appealing to the feelings and religious sentiment of the people. This is something that is quasi-religious".&lt;ref name="HuffPoAPVen"/&gt; The creation of Chávez's cult of personality was a strategy used by his government to maintain legitimacy before and after his death.&lt;ref name="HuffPoAPVen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VICEstrange/&gt;

==Vietnam==
[[File:Ho Chi Minh statue.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ho Chi Minh]] statue in front of the City Hall of [[Ho Chi Minh City]]]]
The [[Vietnam]]ese communist regime has continually maintained a personality cult around [[Ho Chi Minh]] since the 1950s in the [[North Vietnam|North]], and it was later extended to the [[South Vietnam|South]] after [[Vietnamese reunification|reunification]], which it sees as a crucial part of its propaganda campaign surrounding Ho and the Party's past. Ho Chi Minh is frequently glorified in schools by schoolchildren. Opinions, publications and broadcasts that are critical of Ho Chi Minh or that identify his flaws are banned in Vietnam, and the commentators are arrested or fined for "opposing the people's revolution". Ho Chi Minh is even glorified to a religious status as an "immortal saint" by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist Party]], and some people "worship the President", according to a BBC report.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

The former capital of South Vietnam, Saigon, was officially renamed [[Ho Chi Minh City]] on 1 May 1975, one day after its [[Fall of Saigon|capture]], which officially ended the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18328455 | title=Uncle Ho's legacy lives on in Vietnam | first=Viv | last=Marsh | work=BBC News | date=6 June 2012 | accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yugoslavia==
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}

[[Josip Broz Tito]] (in power from 1945 until 1980) developed cult of personality around himself. His cult is described as a combination of a "peasant chief, protector and the legendary hero".&lt;ref&gt;Apor, Behrends, Jones, Rees (2004). The Leader Cult in Communist Dictatorships: Stalin and the Eastern Bloc. Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, his cult of personality included, among other things, [[List of places named after Josip Broz Tito|naming places after him]] (including four cities), celebrations of his birthday (including [[Relay of Youth]]), widespread use of his portraits, writing his name in landscapes, so they can be seen from the air, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/30-years-after-his-death-titos-legacy-lives-on-in-the-balkans-1960884.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.titomanija.com.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zaire==
[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] used his cult of personality to create a god-like public image of himself in [[Zaire]], which today is the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Mobutu created a centralized state, amassed massive wealth for himself and presided over the economic deterioration of his country and [[human rights]] abuses.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

He used mass media communications to entrench his rule.&lt;ref&gt;"Mobutu Sese Seko". The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. Columbia University Press. 2012. Retrieved 30 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu embarked on a campaign of pro-African cultural awareness and in 1972, he formally changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga ("The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.")&lt;ref&gt;There are multiple translations of the full name, including "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake", "the earthy, the peppery, all-powerful warrior who, by his endurance and will to win, goes from contest to contest leaving fire in his wake" and "the man who flies from victory to victory and leaves nothing behind him"&lt;http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/N04.html#Sese&gt; and "the all-powerful warrior who goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake" (Wrong, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fascism sidebar|expanded=Topics}}
This article discusses regimes and movements that have described themselves as [[fascism|fascist]], or are alleged to have been fascist or sympathetic to fascism.

It is often a matter of dispute whether a certain government is to be characterized as fascist (radical authoritarian nationalism), authoritarian, totalitarian, or a police state. The term "fascism" itself is controversial, and has been defined in various ways by different authors. Many of the regimes and movements discussed in this article can be considered fascist according to some definitions but not according to others. See [[definitions of fascism]] for more information on that subject.

==The Axis (1922-1945)==

===Italy (1922–1943)===
{{main|Italian Fascism}}
The first fascist country, Italy, was ruled by [[Benito Mussolini]] (''Il Duce'') until he was dismissed and arrested on 25 July 1943. Mussolini was then rescued from prison by the [[Wehrmacht]], and set up a short-lived puppet state named "[[Italian Social Republic|Repubblica di Salò]]" in northern Italy under the protection of the [[Wehrmacht]].

===Germany (1933–1945)===
{{main|Nazism}}
The [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (Nazis) came to power in Germany as a minority party when its leader, [[Adolf Hitler]], was named [[chancellor#Germany|chancellor]] following the elections of 1933. Hitler moved swiftly to consolidate power, first through passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]]. After the death of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in 1934, the entire power of the German state was concentrated in Hitler's hands.

The German National socialists were known for their use of thuggery and intimidation of political opponents and dissenters, including outright persecution of the country's Jewish citizenry, resulting in the [[Holocaust]]. Nonetheless, they were widely popular among many segments of the German population, particularly the working class, for their perceived success in reversing the nation's economic decline.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises ([1940], 1998). Interventionism: An Economic Analysis, trans. Thomas Francis McManus and Heinrich Bund, ed. Bettina Bien Greaves. Irvington-on-Hudson, NY: Foundation for Economic Education, Inc. {{ISBN|1-57246-071-7}} p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; One of Hitler's cornerstone policies was known as [[Lebensraum]], which served as the rationale for Germany's expansionist foreign policy and ultimately led to the [[World War II|Second World War]].

===Japan (1931–1945)===
{{Main|Statism in Shōwa Japan}}
Right-wing elements in Japan, including industrialists, military officers, and the nobility, had long opposed democracy as an anathema to national unity. Military cliques began to dominate the national government starting in the 1930s. A major militarist nationalist movement in Japan from the 1920s to the 1930s was the [[Imperial Way Faction]] "''Kodoha''" of which future wartime Prime Minister [[Hideki Tōjō]] was a part. In 1936, Japan and Germany signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], aimed at countering the Soviet Union and the [[Comintern|Communist International]]. In 1940, Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoye]] established the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]], or [[Taisei Yokusankai]], to consolidate all political parties under a single umbrella group. That same year, Japan joined Germany and Italy in the [[Tripartite Pact]].

==Other countries==

===Austria (1933–1945)===
{{main|Austro-fascism}}
[[Engelbert Dollfuß]]'s idea of a "Ständestaat" was borrowed from Mussolini. Dollfuß dissolved parliament and established a clerical-fascist dictatorship which lasted until Austria was incorporated into [[Nazi Germany]] through the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of 1938.

===Brazil (1937–1945)===
Many historians have argued that Brazil's [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] under [[Getúlio Vargas]] was a Brazilian variant of the continental fascist regimes. Briefly, Vargas' regime was aligned with [[Plínio Salgado]]'s [[Integralismo|Integralist Party]], Brazil's fascist movement. Vargas launched a cult of personality that endures to this day, on top of the "Worker's Rights" (such as the rights to vacations and minimal wage) being extremely similar to Mussonili's own "Worker's Rights". Criticism on whether the government was fascist or not derives from the fact that Vargas followed the [[Castilhismo]] ideology, which is strongly Positivist, incompatible with Fascism's metaphysical, traditionalist, almost [[Julius Evola|occultist]] ideas.

===Chile (1932-1938)===
In Chile, during the 1930s, there was a [[fascist]]-[[nazism|nazi]] party named [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] (MNS), ruled by [[Jorge González von Marées]], an [[Adolf Hitler]] sympathizer. However, the MNS was dissolved in 1938.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Republic of China (1932–1938; 1941-1945)===
In the 1930s, an elitist group around [[Chiang Kai-shek]] looked to fascism as a "quick" solution to the modernization of China. The [[Blue Shirts Society]] (藍衣社 in Chinese, hereinafter referred to as the BSS), was a secret clique in the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party). Under the direction of Chiang Kai-shek it sought to lead the KMT and China by following the ideology of Fascism and was a secret police or para-military force.

Chiang Kai-shek was confident in his goal to modernize China through an essentially Western method (fascism) and his ability to use it as an instrument while molding it into a Confucianist philosophy. His ideas were given shape by the Blueshirts – in effect an elitist organization within the Kuomintang government structure. This organization practiced the ancient Chinese theory of "knowledge and action" in order to inspire the Chinese people.

Likewise, the more left-wing though politically syncretic faction of the Kuomintang led by [[Wang Jingwei]], which split from the mainline right-wing faction of the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, gradually embraced and espoused increasingly fascist oriented positions, including anti-communist doctrine. This eventually led to their recognition by members of the [[Axis Powers]], including Germany and Italy, when Wang Jingwei's faction of the Kuomintang gained prominence and assumed control of a [[China-Nanjing|puppet regime]] based in [[Nanjing]] established in 1941 by forces of the invading Japanese military.

===Croatia (1941–1945)===
''Poglavnik'' [[Ante Pavelić]], leader of the infamous [[Ustaše]] movement, came to power in 1941 as the Croatian puppet leader under the control of Nazi Germany. Under the indirect control of Germany, the Ustaše regime was based heavily upon both upon clerical fascism and the Italian model of fascism, with elements of racial integrity and organic nationalism drawn from Nazism.

===Finland (1929–1932)===
The [[Lapua Movement]], established in 1929, originally a nationalist movement that opposed Sweden and Russia, turned into a fascist movement in the early 1930s. However, the party's origins could date back to the early 1920s, in [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] forces during the [[Finnish Civil War]]. They attempted a coup d'état in 1932, after which the movement was banned. The Lapua Movement, however, affected the selection of [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] as the [[President of Finland|president]] and the passing of extensive anti-communist laws. Finland stayed a democracy throughout World War II, despite co-operating with [[Nazi Germany]].

===France (1940–1944)===
The [[Vichy regime]] of [[Philippe Pétain]], established following France's defeat by Germany, collaborated with the Nazis. However, the minimal importance of fascists in the government until its direct occupation by Germany makes it appear to seem more similar to the regime of Franco or Salazar than the model fascist powers. While it has been argued that anti-Semitic raids performed by the Vichy regime were more in the interests of pleasing Germany than in service of ideology, anti-semitism was a full component of the "National Revolution" ideology of Vichy.

As early as October 1940 the Vichy regime introduced the infamous ''statut des Juifs'', that produced a new legal definition of Jewishness and which barred Jews from certain public offices. They interned Liberals, Communists, Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals,  in [[concentration camps in France|concentration camps]] as soon as 1940.

Also, in May 1941 the Parisian police force had collaborated in the internment of foreign Jews. As a means of identifying Jews, the German authorities required all Jews in the occupied zone to wear a [[yellow badge]]. On the 11 June, they demanded that 100,000 Jews be handed over for deportation.

The most infamous of these mass arrests was the so-called [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]] (''Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv'') which took place in Paris on the 16 and 17 July 1942. The Vélodrome d'Hiver was a large [[cycle track]] situated on the rue Nélaton near the Quai de Grenelle in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. In a vast operation codenamed "Spring Breeze" (''Vent printanier''), the French police rounded up 13,152 Jews from Paris and its surrounding suburbs. These were mostly adult men and women however approximately 4,000 children were among them. Identifications for the arrests were made easier by the large number of files on Jews complied and held by Vichy authorities since 1940. The French police, headed by [[René Bousquet]], were entirely responsible for this operation and no German soldiers assisted. [[Pierre Laval]], head of Vichy, included the children in the deportations to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] against general German orders. Most of the deportees sealed in the transports died en route due to lack of food or water. The few survivors were sent to the gas chambers. A few months later, a police operation took place in Marseille, known as the [[Battle of Marseille]], and led to massive raids in the so-called "free zone", administrated by Vichy.

===Greece (1936–1941)===

[[Ioannis Metaxas]]' 1936 to 1941 dictatorship was partly fascist in its ideological nature, and might hence be characterized as quasi-fascist or authoritarian. It had a [[Ethniki Organosi Neolaias|National Youth Organisation]] based on the [[Hitlerjugend]], developed an armamentistic-centered economy, established a police-state akin to that of [[Nazi Germany]] (Greece received tactical and material support from [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], who exchanged correspondence with the Greek Minister of State Security [[Konstantinos Maniadakis]]) and brutality against communists in big cities such as Athens(communism was not known at small towns and villages of Greece yet). The Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]]' 1967 to 1974 military dictatorship, which was supported by the United States, however, was less ideological and lacked a clear fascist element other than militarism.

===Hungary (1932–1945)===
By 1932, support for right-wing ideology, embodied by [[Prime Minister]] [[Gyula Gömbös]], had reached the point where Hungarian Regent [[Miklós Horthy]] could not postpone appointing a fascist prime minister. Horthy also showed signs of admiring the efficiency and conservative leanings of the Italian fascist state under Mussolini and was not too reluctant to appoint a fascist government (with terms for the extent of Horthy's power). Horthy would keep control over the mainstream fascist movement in Hungary until near the end of the Second World War. However, Gömbös never had a truly powerful fascist base of support. Instead, the radical [[Arrow Cross|Arrow Cross Party]], which gained support in Budapest as well as the countryside, became a powerful political movement, gaining nearly 800,000 votes in the election of 1939. Horthy became paranoid due to his new rival, and imprisoned the Arrow Cross Party's leader, [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. However, this action only increased popular support for the fascist movement. In another attempt to challenge the Arrow Cross, Horthy's government began to imitate the Arrow Cross Party's ideology. Starting in 1938, several racial laws, mostly against [[Jews]], were passed by the regime, but the extremist Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Szálasi, was banned until German pressure lifted the law, and until Germany occupied Hungary during [[Operation Margarethe]] on March 19, 1944, no Jews were in direct danger of being annihilated. In July 1944, armor-colonel Ferenc Koszorús and the First Armour Division, under Horthy's orders, resisted the Arrow Cross militia and prevented the deportation of the Jews of Budapest, thus saved over 200,000 lives. This act impressed upon the German occupying forces, including [[Adolf Eichmann]], that as long as Hungary continued to be governed by Horthy, no real ''Endlösung'' could begin. Following Horthy's attempt to have Hungary change sides on October 13, Szálasi, with German military support, launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and replaced Admiral Horthy as Head of State. The regime changed to a system more in line with Nazism and would remain this way until the capture of Budapest by Soviet troops. Over 400,000 Jews were sent by Hungary to German death camps from 1944 to 1945.

===Norway (1943–1945)===
[[Vidkun Quisling]] had staged a ''[[coup d'état]]'' during the German invasion on April 9, 1940. This first government was replaced by a Nazi puppet government under his leadership from February 1, 1943. His party never had any substantial support in Norway, undermining his attempts to emulate the Italian fascist state.

===Portugal (1932–1974)===
The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] borrowed many of the ideas towards military and governance from Mussolini's Fascist regime and adapted to the Spanish example of paternal iconography for authoritarianism. Even though the regime was supportive of Mussolini and Hitler's efforts, it kept on the political sidelines throughout the war and instead offered only aid and business with both Italy and Germany during this period.

===Poland (1930s)===
During the 1930s, the rise of fascist-inspired organizations occurred in Poland. Fascist organizations like the Association of Polish Fascists (Związek Faszystów Polskich) were however marginal and ephemeral. Fascist-inspired organizations were however stronger than parties with clearly fascist programs. [[National Radical Camp Falanga]] was the most prominent of them. It was created by radical youth members with [[National Democracy|National Democratic]] origins. Falanga was nonetheless quickly banned by the authoritarian ruling [[Sanacja]] regime and continued to operate clandestinely. It was also involved in frequent street violence and anti-Semitic riots.

===Romania (1940–1944)===
The [[Iron Guard]] turned more and more into a pro-Nazi and pro-German movement and took power in September 1940 when [[Ion Antonescu]] forced King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] to abdicate. However, the cohabitation between the Iron Guard and [[Ion Antonescu]] was short-lived.

During the 1930s, the group combined a mix of [[Christian]] faith, [[antisemitism]], and calls for [[land reform]] for [[farmers]], who still lived in a quasi-[[feudal]] society. However, the extremely violent nature of the movement made it difficult for the Iron Guard to attract [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[middle class]] people, and as a result, the movement could never be as successful as the [[Nazi Party]].

The Antonescu regime that followed had elements of fascism, but it lacked a clear political program or party. It was more a [[military dictatorship]]. The regime was characterized by nationalism, antisemitism, and anti-communism, but had no social program. Despite the [[Iaşi pogrom]] and a near-liquidation of the Jews of many parts of [[Moldavia]], the regime ultimately refused to send the Romanian Jews to German death camps. The regime was overthrown on 23 August 1944 in a coup led by the king [[Mihai of Romania]].

===Slovakia (1939–1944)===
The [[Slovak People's Party]] was a quasi-fascist nationalist movement. It was associated with the Roman Catholic Church and founded by Father [[Andrej Hlinka]]. His successor Monsignor [[Jozef Tiso]] was a president of nominally independent Slovakia in 1939–1945. His government colleagues like Vojtech Tuka or Alexander Mach collaborate with fascism. The clerical element lends comparison with Austrofascism or the clerical fascism of Croatia, though not to the excesses of either model. The market system was run on principles agreeing with the standard Italian fascist model of industrial regulation.

===Spain (1936–1975)===
After the 1936 arrest and execution of its founder, [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], during the Spanish Civil War, the fascist [[Falange]] Española Party was allied to and ultimately came to be dominated by Generalísimo [[Francisco Franco]], who became known as ''El Caudillo'', the undisputed leader of the Nationalist side in the war and, after victory, head of state until his death over 35 years later. However, it was best described as an autocracy based on the Falangist fascist principles in its early years. By the mid-1950s, the [[Spanish Miracle]] and the rise of [[Opus Dei]] in the Franco regime led to Falangist fascism being discarded and fascists minimized in importance.

===South Africa===
There have been three waves of fascism in South Africa. Beginning with D F Malan's support of Hitler's brown shirts and the activities of [[Robey Leibbrandt]] in the 1930s and 1940s, the second wave during the 1970s and 1980s which created fringe right-wing groups such as the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]].

=== Yugoslavia (1935–1945) ===
[[Yugoslav Radical Union]] was a Yugoslav fascist group run by [[Milan Stojadinović]]. Party members wore green shirt uniforms, addressed Stojadinović as ''Vodja'' and used the [[Roman salute]]. The party was dissolved following the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]]

==Fascism in democratic nations==
Prior to World War II, fascist or quasi-fascist movements also appeared in democratic nations, often taking their inspiration from the regimes established by Mussolini and Hitler.

===Australia (1931 – late 1930s)===
The [[New Guard]] attempted to violently remove New South Wales Premier [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] from office.

===Canada (1930s–1940)===
In the 1930s, Canada had fascist fringe groups within it. One stronger group was the ''[[Parti national social chrétien]]''  of [[Adrien Arcand]] which had significant support. Arcand believed in the anti-Semitic policies of Hitler and called himself the "Canadian Führer". In 1934, his Quebec-based party merged with the western-based fascist [[Nationalist Party of Canada]]. In 1938, the [[English Canadian]] and [[French Canadian]] fascist movements united into the National Unity Party. The only fascist politician ever to be elected in Canada was a man by the name of P. M. Campbell who ran and won under the fascist [[Unity Party of Alberta]] for [[Lethbridge]] in a [[List of Alberta by-elections#8th Legislative Assembly of Alberta 1935-1940|1937 Alberta Provincial By-Election]]. In 1940, all fascist parties were banned under Canada's [[War Measures Act]].

===Belgium (1930s–1945)===
{{main|Rexism}}
The [[Rexism|Rexist]] movement and the [[Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond]] party achieved some electoral success in the 1930s. The party could be label as [[clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] with its roots in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Conservatism]]. The party gained rapid support for a brief period, focusing on the secularism, corruption, and ineffectiveness on [[parliamentary democracy]] in Belgium. Many of its members assisted the Nazi occupation during World War II. The [[Verdinaso]] movement, too, can be considered fascist. Its leader, [[Joris Van Severen]], was killed before the Nazi occupation. Some of its adepts collaborated, but others joined the [[Resistance movement|resistance]]. These collaborationist movements are generally classified as belonging to the National Socialist model or the German fascist model because of its brand of racial nationalism and the close relation with the occupational authorities.

===Ireland (1932–1933)===
Fascist sympathizers led by General [[Eoin O'Duffy]] established the [[Army Comrades Association]], or "Blueshirts" in 1932 as a veterans organization. Renamed the National Guard, it eventually became the paramilitary wing of the United Ireland Party. The Blueshirts wanted to establish a corporate state in Ireland and frequently clashed with Republican supporters of the ruling [[Fianna Fáil]], who were using force to disrupt that party's meetings. O’Duffy planned a parade in Dublin in 1933, and the government, fearing a coup, banned the organization. The organization began to decline soon after. Blueshirts under O’Duffy's leadership later fought for Franco during the Nationalist uprising in Spain.

===Mexico (1930–1942)===
A reactionary nationalist movement called Acción Revolucionaria Mexicana (Mexican Revolutionary Action), founded by former Villista general [[Nicolas Rodriguez Carrasco]], agitated for right-wing causes, such as the deportation of Jews and Chinese-Mexicans, throughout the 1930s. ARM maintained a paramilitary force called the [[Goldshirts]], which clashed frequently with Communist activists, and supported the presidential faction of [[Plutarco Calles]] against the liberal reformist president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]]. The paramilitary group was banned in 1936 and the ARM officially disbanded in 1942, when Mexico declared war against the Axis.

===The Netherlands (1923–1945)===
The ''Verbond van Actualisten'' (Union of Actualists) was the oldest fascist movement in the Netherlands. It was established on 22 January 1923 and its ideology was based on Mussolini's Italian fascist movement. It ceased all activities in November 1928 after having had no success at all. It was succeeded by the ''Vereeniging De Bezem'' (Association 'The Broom') which was founded on 15 December 1928 by some men who previously were active in the ''Verbond van Actualisten''. Its aim was to clean Dutch politics – hence the name. Its downfall in 1932 was caused by continuous discord between its leaders. On 14 December 1931 [[Anton Mussert]] and [[Cornelis van Geelkerken]] founded the ''[[Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging|Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging in Nederland]]'' (NSB), the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands. It started as a fascist movement, Italian style, but at the same time its ideology was based on [[Hitler]]s [[NSDAP]]. In the years 1935–1936 the party embraced [[antisemitism]]. Its best pre-war election result was 7,9% of the voters (1935). The maximum number of member of the NSB was 100,000 (around 1,25% of the Dutch population). Soon after the German occupation in May 1940 the NSB became the only allowed political party. Never once during the years of WW II the NSB was giving any real power, instead, the Germans used the NSB for their own purposes. After the German defeat, the NSB disappeared. On 29 June 1932 [[Jan Baars]] (previously active in the ''Vereeniging 'De Bezem''') founded the ''Algemeene Nederlandsche Fascisten Bond'' (General Dutch Fascist Federation). It was the first Dutch fascist political party to gain significant election results and it had a considerable number of members. Its political views were quite moderate and it disapproved German Nazi [[racism]] and antisemitism. It ended its existence in 1934. Its main successful successor was ''Zwart Front'' (Black Front), 1934–1941. Its leaders were of a Catholic origin and the party was strongly based on Italian fascism. During the pre-war period, it never established a prominent position like Mussert's NSB. After the German invasion in May 1940, the number of members rose from 4,000 to 12,000. The Germans prohibited ''Zwart Front'' in December 1941.

Other, smaller, fascist and Nazi parties were: ''Verbond van Nationalisten'' (Union of Nationalists, 1928–1934), the ''Nationaal-Socialistische Nederlandsche Arbeiders Partij'' (National Socialist Dutch Workers Party, 1931–1941), ''Nationaal-Socialistische Partij'' (National Socialist Party, 1932–1941), ''Nederlandsche Fascisten Unie'' (Dutch Fascist Union, 1933), ''Unie van Nederlandsche Fascisten'' (Union of Dutch Fascists, 1933), ''Oranje-Fascisten'' (Orange Fascists, 1933), ''Frysk Fascisten Front'' (Frisian Fascist Front, 1933), ''Corporatieve Concentratie'' (Corporative Concentration, 1933–1934), ''Verbond voor Nationaal Herstel'' (Union for National Restoration, 1933–1941), ''Nederlandsche Nationaal-Socialistische Partij'' (Dutch National Socialist Party, 1935) and the ''Nederlandsche Volkspartij'' (Dutch People's Party, 1938–1940).

Dutch fascism and Nazism is known for its lack of coherence and it was dominated by the egos of its leaders. An important fact for its marginal position in pre-war Dutch politics was the absence of a 'lost generation' of combatants of WW I.

===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], the [[Kataeb Party]] (Phalange) was formed in 1936, with inspiration of the Spanish [[Falange]] and [[Italian Fascism]]. The founder of the party, [[Pierre Gemayel]], founded the party after returning from a visit at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. The party is still active today, although it has abandoned the Falangist and Fascist ideology in place of Phoenicianism, social Conservatism, Republicanism, and anti-Islam.

===Sweden (1926–1929)===
The [[National Socialist People's Party of Sweden|''Sveriges Fascistiska Folkparti'']] (''SFF''; "Fascist People's Party of Sweden") was founded in 1926.  Major figures of the party included its founding leader, Konrad Hallgren, a former German officer, and Swedish soldiers [[Sven Olov Lindholm]] and [[Sven Hedengren]].

In 1929 a delegation of the party, led by Hallgren and Lindholm, attended a major rally of the [[NSDAP|German Nazi party]], at Nuremberg. Afterwards, the ''SFF'' was more strongly influenced by Nazism and changed its name to [[National Socialist People's Party of Sweden|''Sveriges Nationalsocialistiska Folkparti'']] (''SNF''; Swedish National Socialist People's Party). The ''SNF'' was one of several [[Swedish Nazi]] parties.

===United Kingdom (1932–1940)===
[[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]], an admirer of [[Mussolini]], established the [[British Union of Fascists]] in 1932 as a nationalist alternative to the three mainstream political parties in Britain. Though the BUF achieved only limited success in some local elections, their existence caused frequent riots, usually instigated by Communist movements. Alarmed at the violence caused by the BUF, the government passed the [[Public Order Act 1936|Public Order Act]] in 1936 to restrict its activity. During the latter years of the decade, the party experienced a revival in popularity on the back of its anti-war campaign. The BUF was banned in 1940 and Mosley was interned for the duration of the war. The relative stability of democratic institutions, the long-time assimilation of [[Jews]], and the lack of a strong, threatening Communist movement, had made it difficult for fascism to succeed in [[UK|Britain]].

===United States of America (1933-1941)===
The [[Silver Legion of America]] (1933-1941), claiming around 15,000 members, managed to run a candidate for President on a third-party ticket, but was outlawed after [[Nazi Germany]]'s declaration of war on the United States in late 1941.

==Differences among fascist movements==
Despite the arousal of [[fascist]] movements across Europe and the world, many were different in their nature in ideology. Some like the [[Iron Guard]] and [[Arrow Cross Party]] had strong support among the [[proletariat]], unlike [[Nazism]] and [[Italian Fascism]], which relied more on the support of the middle class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Meanwhile, some regimes, especially those appointed by [[Hitler]] like [[Vichy France]], was made up of the [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] elite. Others also had different degrees of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] elements.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Some groups, like the ones in [[Croatia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], and [[Slovakia]], had its roots in [[reactionary]] and [[populism|populist]] [[Political Catholicism|Catholicism]]. The [[Iron Guard]] also had strong religious influences and was defined, by its leaders, as more of a religious order than a [[political party]]. Fascist leaders like [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Vidkun Quisling]] tried to stage direct military coups, while other fascist groups formed political parties and tried to take power through the existing democratic process, such as [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]].

{{War}}

This '''list of wars by death toll''' includes death toll estimates of all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by war. These numbers usually include the deaths of military personnel which are the direct results of battle or other military wartime actions, as well as the wartime/war-related deaths of soldiers, which are the results of war-induced epidemics, famines, atrocities, genocide, etc.

|&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/recounting-the-dead/ Recounting the dead], Associate Professor J. David Hacker, "''estimates, based on Census data, indicate that the death toll was at least 750,000, and may have been as high as 850,000''" (study refers only to military casualties)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James M. McPherson, "Battle Cry of Freedom", Oxford University Press, Oct 24, 2003, page 619. "Suffering and death were widespread, nevertheless, and a fair estimate of war-related civilian deaths might total 50,000".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Professor James Downs. [http://blog.oup.com/2012/04/black-white-demographic-death-toll-civil-war/ "Color blindness in the demographic death toll of the Civil War".] Oxford University Press, April 13th 2012. "An 2 April 2012 New York Times article, "New Estimate Raises Civil War Death Toll," reports that a new study ratchets up the death toll from an estimated 650,000 to a staggering 850,000 people. As horrific as this new number is, it fails to reflect the mortality of former slaves during the war. If former slaves were included in this figure, the Civil War death toll would likely be over a million casualties... the rough 19th century estimate was that 60,000 former slaves died from [war-related diseases and starvation], but doctors treating black patients often claimed that they were unable to keep accurate records due to demands on their time and the lack of manpower and resources... tens of thousands of other slaves who died had no contact with army doctors, leaving no records of their deaths".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Party politics}}

A '''multi-party system''' is a system in which multiple political parties across the political spectrum run for national election, and all have the capacity to gain control of government offices, separately or in [[coalition government|coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.education2020.com/activities/vocab.aspx?keystr=12674&amp;order=02010205&amp;stbl=2196465 Education 2020] definition of '''multiparty''': ''"A system in which several major and many lesser parties exist, seriously compete for, and actually win public offices."''&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[Dominant-party system|one-party-dominant]] and [[Two-party system|two-party systems]], multi-party systems tend to be more common in [[parliamentary system]]s than [[presidential system]]s and far more common in countries that use [[proportional representation]] compared to countries that use [[first-past-the-post]] elections. 

First-past-the-post requires concentrated areas of support for large representation in the [[legislature]] whereas proportional representation better reflects the range of a population's views. Proportional systems may have [[Electoral district|multi-member districts]] with more than one representative elected from a given district to the same legislative body, and thus a greater number of viable parties. [[Duverger's law]] states that the number of viable political parties is one plus the number of seats in a district. 

[[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Croatia]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Lebanon]], [[Maldives]], [[Mexico]], [[Moldova]], [[Nepal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Taiwan]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Ukraine]] are examples of nations that have used a multi-party system effectively in their democracies. In these countries, usually no single party has a parliamentary majority by itself. Instead, multiple political parties are compelled to form compromised [[coalition]]s for the purpose of developing power blocks and attaining legitimate [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]].

==Comparisons with other party systems==

===One-party system and two-party system===
{{see also|one-party system|Two-party system}}
A system where only two parties have the possibility of winning an election is called two-party system. A system where only three parties have a ''realistic possibility'' of winning an election or forming a coalition is sometimes called a "Third-party system". But, in some cases the system is called a "Stalled Third-Party System," when there are three parties and all three parties win a large number of votes, but only two have a chance of winning an election. Usually this is because the electoral system penalises the third party, e.g. as in Canadian or UK politics. In the 2010 elections, the Liberal Democrats gained 23% of the total vote but won less than 10% of the seats due to the first-past-the-post electoral system. Despite this, they still had enough seats (and enough public support) to form coalitions with one of the two major parties, or to make deals in order to gain their support. An example is the [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] formed after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. Another is the [[Lib-Lab pact]] during Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]]'s Minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government; when Labour lost its three-seat majority in 1977, the pact fell short of a full coalition. In Canada, there are three major federal political parties; the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], and the [[New Democratic Party of Canada]]. However, the Liberals and Conservatives have been the only two parties to form government in Canada with the New Democrats as the third party, except in the [[2011 Canadian election]] when the New Democrats were the Official Opposition.

Unlike a [[One-party state|one-party system]] (or a two-party system), a multi-party system encourages the general [[constituency]] to form multiple distinct, officially recognized groups, generally called [[political party|political parties]]. Each party competes for votes from the [[suffrage|enfranchised]] constituents (those allowed to vote). A multi-party system prevents the leadership of a single party from controlling a single [[legislative]] chamber without challenge.

If the government includes an elected [[Congress]] or [[Parliament]], the parties may share power according to [[proportional representation]] or the [[first-past-the-post]] system. In proportional representation, each party wins a number of seats proportional to the number of votes it receives. In first-past-the-post, the electorate is divided into a number of districts, each of which selects one person to fill one seat by a [[plurality voting|plurality of the vote]]. First-past-the-post is not conducive to a proliferation of parties, and naturally gravitates toward a [[two-party system]], in which only two parties have a real chance of electing their candidates to office. This gravitation is known as [[Duverger's law]]. Proportional representation, on the other hand, does not have this tendency, and allows multiple major parties to arise. But, recent [[coalition]] governments, such as that in the U.K., represent two-party systems rather than multi-party systems. This is regardless of the number of parties in government.

A two-party system requires voters to align themselves in large blocs, sometimes so large that they cannot agree on any overarching principles. Some theories argue that this allows [[centrism|centrist]]s to gain control. On the other hand, if there are multiple major parties, each with less than a majority of the vote, the parties are strongly motivated to work together to form working governments. This also promotes centrism, as well as promoting coalition-building skills while discouraging polarization.&lt;ref&gt;The social science literature has contributed enormously in recent years on the effects on forms of government and quality of life of the citizens. Lowell’s axiom is one of the most tested theory empirically tested (Lowell, A.L., 1896). [https://www.academia.edu/29273929/Is_multi-party_coalition_government_better_for_the_protection_of_socially_backward_classes_in_India Governments and Parties in Continental Europe. Bostin, MA: Houghton Mifflin).&lt;/span&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basu, K., Dey Biswas, S., Harish, P., Dhar, S., &amp; Lahiri, M. (2016).

[[Image:Gaspard De La Fontaine.jpg|thumb|[[Gaspard-Théodore-Ignace de la Fontaine]], leader of the Orangists]]
'''Orangism''' was a movement in the 19th century [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] favouring the [[personal union]] of the [[Netherlands]] and Luxembourg under the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. Made up of many notable figures, mainly nobles and Roman Catholic clergy, they were moderate liberals or conservative-liberals and slightly anti-clerical. At first they favoured maintaining the Grand Duchy's autonomous status and, especially during the [[Belgian Revolution]], opposed it being merged into [[Belgium]]. In the end the western part of the Grand Duchy (the present province of [[Luxembourg (province)|Luxembourg]]) passed to Belgium, whilst the eastern part and the Orange grand duchy continued as an independent state. In 1890 the heads of the House of Orange were grand dukes of Luxembourg, but on the death of king and grand duke [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1890 he was succeeded by his relation [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] as grand duke since Luxembourg's constitution did not allow a woman ([[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]]) to hold the throne. The movement's newsletter was the ''Journal de la Ville et du Pays Luxembourg''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In [[criminology]], a '''political crime''' or '''political offence''' is an [[Crime|offence]] involving overt acts or [[Omission (criminal law)|omissions]] (where there is a duty to act), which prejudice the interests of the [[State (polity)|state]], its [[government]], or the political system. It is to be distinguished from [[state crime]], in which it is the states that break both their own [[criminal law]]s or [[public international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

States will define as political crimes any behaviour perceived as a threat, real or imagined, to the state's survival, including both violent and non-violent oppositional crimes. A consequence of such criminalisation may be that a range of [[human rights]], [[civil rights]], and freedoms are curtailed, and conduct which would not normally be considered criminal ''per se'' (in other words, that is not antisocial according to those who engage in it) is criminalised at the convenience of the group holding power.

Thus, there may be a question of the [[morality]] of a law which simply criminalises ordinary [[political dissent]],&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; even though the majority of those who support the current regime may consider criminalisation of politically motivated behaviour an acceptable response when the offender is driven by more extreme political, [[ideological]], religious or other beliefs, 

==Overview==
At one extreme, crimes such as [[treason]], [[sedition]], and [[terrorism]] are political because they represent a direct challenge to the government in power. [[Espionage]] is usually considered a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden: extradition of US spy suspect 'unlikely'|work=[[The Local]]|date=27 April 2013|url=http://www.thelocal.se/47580/20130427/|quote='If it's a political offence, you can't extradite a person' to a country outside the EU, said Per Clareus, a spokesman for Swedish Justice Minister Beatrice Ask. 'And espionage is usually considered a political crime,' he added.}}&lt;/ref&gt; But offenders do not have to aim to overthrow the government or to depose its leaders to be acting in a way perceived as "political". A state may perceive it threatening if individuals advocate change to the established order, or argue the need for reform of long-established policies, or engage in acts signifying some degree of disloyalty, e.g. by burning the nation's flag in public. But the scope of such crimes can be rather less direct.

[[Structural functionalism|Structural functionist]] criminologists recognise that states invest their resources in maintaining order through social conformity, i.e. a particular [[culture]] is encouraged and maintained through the primary social discourses which may include religious, economic, social, or other less formal concerns. Any interference with the media of communication or the sets of meanings embedded in the communications themselves may be perceived as a threat to the political authority of the state. Hence, whether in hard copy or electronically, if individuals distribute material containing uncensored information which undermines the credibility of state-controlled news media, this may be considered threatening.

Moreover, even an offence against non-governmental institutions, persons, or practices may be deemed political. Violence or even discrimination against an ethnic or racial group, as well [[trade union]] [[strike action|strikes]] or [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] against private [[employer]]s, can be perceived as a political crime when those in power see such conduct as undermining the political (and economic) stability of the state. In this context, note that the Law Enforcement Code of Conduct passed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police says in part: "The fundamental duties of a police officer include serving the community, safeguarding lives and property, protecting the innocent, keeping the peace and ensuring the rights of all to liberty, equality and justice" (cited in Robinson, 2002). This code requires that police behave in a courteous and fair manner, that they treat all citizens in a respectable and decent manner, and that they never use unnecessary force. When they do, it is argued that this constitutes a crime (e.g. as an [[assault]]) and, if it is institutionalised, then over time, the use of unnecessary force become a state crime.

[[Marxist criminology|Marxist criminologists]] argue that most political crime arises from the efforts of the state to reproduce the structures of inequality: [[racism]], [[sexism]], ethnic preference as well as [[social class|class]] advantages. Thus, states will protect property rights and reduce the rights of trade unions to represent the interests of the poor. Even war could be grounded in the problems of local capitalists in wealthy countries in the effort to move raw materials, profits and jobs in a globalised political economy, and opposing such a war will be a political crime. Marxists do not dispute that, for a [[society]] to function efficiently, social order is necessary. But they consider that, in all societies, one class, usually characterised as the "ruling class", gains far more than other classes. Marxists agree with functionalists that [[socialisation]] plays a crucial role in promoting conformity and order. However, unlike the latter, they are highly critical of the ideas, values and norms of "capitalist ideology". Modern Marxists point to education and the media as socialising agencies, which delude or "mystify" the working class into conforming to a social order, which works against its real interests. Thus, all controls which directly or indirectly explit the criminal law to control access to the discourses are political crimes.

==Authoritarian governments==
Miller says that one of the defining characteristics of power in modern history has been the rationalisation and bureaucratisation of law. Legal codification, or at least debates over the merits of legal codification, became an almost global phenomenon in the nineteenth century as state power was centralised. In particular, the rationalisation of criminal law standardised not just the concept of crime, but was adopted as the means to eliminate the "deviant" as a threat to a modern, uniform, moral standard. In this, the religious establishment began to play a new role in defining "evil" in which threats to the political or social norm became as dangerous as threats to religious orthodoxy. Thus, political speech became one of the most likely activities to be criminalised. The freedom of association and to meet may also be criminalised if the purpose is to express oppositional political views.

Because a political offender may be fighting against a tyrannical government, treaties have usually specified that a person cannot be extradited for a political offense. [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Writings of Thomas Jefferson: Correspondence|author=Jefferson, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Treason. This, when real, merits the highest punishment. But most Codes extend their definitions of treason to acts not really against one's country. They do not distinguish between acts against the government, and acts against the Oppressions of the Government. The latter are virtues: yet have furnished more victims to the Executioner than the former. Because real Treasons are rare: Oppressions frequent. The unsuccessful Struggles against Tyranny have been the chief Martyrs of Treason laws in all countries. Reformation of government with our neighbors, as much wanting now as Reformation of religion is, or ever was anywhere. We should not wish then to give up to the Executioner the Patriot who fails, and flees to us. Treasons then, taking the simulated with the real are sufficiently punished by Exile.}}

==Specific crimes==

===Terrorism===
People convicted or suspected of certain crimes classified as terrorism by the government of their country (or some foreign countries) reject that classification. They consider that their fight is a legitimate one using legitimate means, and thus their crimes should be more appropriately called political crimes and justify special treatment in the penal system (as if they were soldiers in a war and therefore covered by the [[Geneva Convention]]). States tend to consider the political nature of the crimes an aggravating factor in the [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] process and make no distinction between the terrorists and "ordinary" offenders, e.g. the convicted murderers of [[Action Directe (gang)|Action Directe]] consider themselves [[political prisoner]]s.

===Religious crimes===
{{Further|Secularism}}
Where there is no clear separation between the state and the prevailing religion, the edicts of the church may be codified as law and enforced by the secular policing and judicial authorities. This is a highly functionalist mechanism for enforcing conformity in all aspects of cultural life and the use of the label "crime" adds an extra layer of stigma to those convicted.

{{Politics |Related}}

'''Political psychology''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field dedicated to understanding [[politics]], [[politician]]s and [[political behavior]] from a [[psychology|psychological]] perspective. The relationship between politics and psychology is considered bi-directional, with psychology being used as a lens for understanding politics and politics being used as a lens for understanding psychology. As an interdisciplinary field, political psychology borrows from a wide range of other disciplines, including: [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[economics]], [[philosophy]], [[Media (communication)|media]], [[journalism]] and [[history]].

Political psychology aims to understand interdependent relationships between individuals and contexts that are influenced by beliefs, motivation, perception, cognition, information processing, learning strategies, socialization and attitude formation. Political psychological theory and approaches have been applied in many contexts such as: leadership role; domestic and foreign policy making; behavior in ethnic violence, war and genocide; group dynamics and conflict; racist behavior; voting attitudes and motivation; voting and the role of the media; nationalism; and political extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition = 2nd |publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence political psychologists study the foundations, dynamics, and outcomes of political behavior using cognitive and social explanations.

==History and early influences==

===France===
Political psychology originated from Western Europe, France, where it was closely tied to the emergence of new disciplines and paradigms as well as to the precise social and political context in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., 'Outline of a cultural history of political psychology'. Chapter 1, pp. 3-22 in: Stone, W. &amp; Schaffner, P. (1988), The psychology of politics. New York: Springer (2nd ed.). More elaborate backgrounds in: Van Ginneken. J. (1992). Crowds, psychology and politics. New York: Cambridge University Press. And its sequel: Van Ginneken, J. (2007). Mass movements. Apeldoorn (Neth.): Spinhuis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The discipline political psychology was formally introduced during the Franco-Prussian war and the socialist revolution, stirred by the rise of the [[Paris Commune]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "political psychology" was first introduced by the [[ethnologist]] Adolph Bastian in his book ''[[Man in History]]'' (1860). The philosopher [[Hippolyte Taine]] (1828–1893), a founder of the Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, applied Bastian's theories in his works ''[[The Origins of Contemporary France]]'' (1875–1893), to ideas on the founding and development of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The head of Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, [[Emile Boutmy]] (1835–1906), was a famous explorer of social, political and geographical concepts of national interactions. He contributed various works on political psychology such as ''English People; A study of their Political Psychology'' (1901) and ''The American People; Elements of Their Political Psychology'' (1902).&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudmin |first=F. W. |title= G.B.Grundy's 1917 Proposal for Political Psychology: "A science shich has yet to be Created" |journal= ISPP News |year=2005 |volume=16 |pages=6–7 |url= http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/RudminGrundyBio6.pdf|accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contributor of [[Crowd psychology|crowd theory]] [[Gustave Le Bon]] (1841–1931) suggested that crowd activity subdued will and polluted rational thought which resulted in uncontrollable impulses and emotions. He suggested in his works ''Psychology of Socialism'' (1896) and ''Political Psychology and Social Defense'' (1910)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in the uncontrollable state of a crowd people were more vulnerable to submission and leadership, and suggested that embracing [[nationalism]] would remedy this.

===Italy===
Meanwhile in Italy, the [[Risorgimento]] (1870) instigated various social reforms and voting rights. The large division in social class during this period led lawyer [[Gaetano Mosca]] (1858–1914) to publish his work, ''The Ruling Class: Elements of Political Science'' (1896), which theorized the presence of the ruling and the ruled classes of all societies.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The psychology of Politics|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing| page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1828–1923), inspired by Mosca's concepts, contributed ''The Rise and Fall of the Elites'' (1901) and ''The Socialist System'' (1902–1903) to the discipline of political psychology, theorizing on the role of class and social systems. His work ''[[The Mind and Society]]'' (1916) offers a sociology [[treatise]].&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1"&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.9)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosca and Pareto's texts on the Italian elite contributed to the theories of Robert Michels (1875–1936). Michels was a German socialist fascinated by the distinction between the largely lower class run parliament in Germany and upper class run parliament in Italy. He wrote ''Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchic Tendencies of Modern Democracy'' (1911).&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1" /&gt;

===Austria===
A large psychoanalytical influence was contributed to the discipline of political psychology by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). His texts ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913) and ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1921) linked psychoanalysis with politics. Freud and [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|Bullitt]] (1967) developed the first psychobiographical explanation to how the personality characteristics of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] affected his decision making during World War I. [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957), inspired by the effects of World War II, was interested in whether personality types varied according to epoch, culture and class. He described the bidirectional effect of group, society and the environment with personality. He combined Freudian and [[Marxist]] theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' (1933). He also edited ''The Journal for Political Psychology and Sexual Economy'' (1934–1938) which was the first journal to present political psychology in the principal of western language.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.11)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, novice political alterations and [[fascist]] control during World War II spurred research into authoritarianism from [[Frankfurt school]]. Philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) opened up issues concerning freedom and authority in his book, ''[[Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory]]'' (1941), where he suggested groups compromise on individual rights. [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969) also investigated authoritarian individuals and anti-Semitism. His report ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) attempts to determine the personality type susceptible to following fascism and anti-democratic propaganda. Nazi movements during World War II also spurred controversial psychologists such as [[Walther Poppelreuter]] (1932) to lecture and write about political psychology that identified with Hitler. The psychologist [[Eric Jaensch]] (1883–1940) contributed the racist book ''The Anti-type'' (1933).

===United Kingdom===
At the turn of the century, [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] introduced disciplinary political psychology courses such as "The Sciences of the Man", along with the foundation of the Psychological society (1901) and the Sociological society (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford historian [[G. B. Grundy]] (1861–1948) noted political psychology (1917) as a sub-discipline of history. Motivated by social and political behavior during World War I, he deemed a new branch of historical science, "The Psychology of Men Acting in Masses".&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; He referred to science to instrument the clarification of mistaken beliefs about intention.&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; The intellectual [[Graham Wallas]] (1859–1932) implicated the significance of studying psychology in politics in  ''Human Nature in Politics'' (1908). Wallace emphasized the importance of enlightening politicians and the public about the psychological processes in order to raise awareness on exploitation while developing control over one's own psychological intellect. He suggested in ''[[Great Society (book)|Great Society]]'' (1917) that recognition of such processes could help to build a more functional humanity.

===United States===
Across the Atlantic the first American to be considered a political psychologist was [[Harold Lasswell]] (1902–1978) whose research was also spurred by a sociological fascination of World War I. His work ''Propaganda Technique in the World War'' (1927) discussed the use of applying psychological theories in order to enhance propaganda technique.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.19)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasswell moved to Europe shortly after where he started to tie Freudian and Adler personality theories to politics and published ''Psychopathology and Politics'' (1930). His major theories involved the motives of the politically active and the relation between propaganda and personality.

Another contributing factor to the development of Political Psychology was the introduction of psychometrics and "The Measurement of Attitude" by [[Thurstone]] and [[Chave]] (1929). The methodological revolution in social science gave quantitative grounds and therefore more credibility to Political Psychology. Research into political preference during campaigns was spurred by [[George Gallup]] (1901–1984), who founded the "American Institute of Public Opinion". The 1940s election in America drew a lot of attention in connection with the start of World War II. Gallup, Roper and Crossley instigated research into the chances of Roosevelt being re-elected. Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet (1944) also conducted a famous panel study "The People's Choice" on the 1940s election campaign. These studies drew attention to the possibility of measuring political techniques using psychological theories.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the US into World War II spiraled vast research into fields such as war technique, propaganda, group moral, psycho-biography and culture conflict to name a few, with the U.S. army and Navy recruiting young psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the discipline quickly developed and gained international accreditation.

McGuire identifies three broad phases in the development of political psychology, these three phases are:
1.The era of [[personality studies]] in the 1940s and 1950s dominated by psychoanalysis 
2.The era of [[political attitudes]] and voting behavior studies in the 1960s and 1970s characterized by the popularity of "rational man" assumptions
3.An era since the 1980s and 1990s, which has focused on [[political beliefs]], information processing and decision making, and has dealt in particular with international politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2013 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and politics==

The study of [[Personality psychology|personality]] in political psychology focuses on the effects of leadership personality on decision-making, and the consequences of mass personality on leadership boundaries. Key personality approaches utilized in political psychology are psychoanalytic theories, trait-based theories and motive-based theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A psychoanalytical approach===
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) made significant contributions to the study of personality in political psychology through his theories on the unconscious motives of behavior. Freud suggested that a leader's behavior and decision making skill were largely determined by the interaction in their personality of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#id|id]], [[Id, ego and super-ego#ego|ego]] and [[superego]], and their control of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] and [[reality principle]]. The psychoanalytic approach has also been used extensively in psychobiographies of political leaders. Psychobiographies draw inferences from personal, social and political development, starting from childhood, to understand behavior patterns that can be implemented to predict decision-making motives and strategies.

===A trait-based approach===
Traits are personality characteristics that show to be stable over time and in different situations, creating predispositions to perceive and respond in particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press| page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1897-1967) realized the study of traits introducing central, secondary, cardinal and common traits. These four distinctions suggest that people demonstrate traits to varying degrees, and further that there is a difference between individual and common traits to be recognized within a society. [[Hans Eysenck]] (1916-1997) contributed three major traits, currently however [[Paul Costa Jr|Costa]] and [[Robert R. McCrae|McCrae]]'s (1992)  "Big Five" personality dimensions are the most recognized. These include; neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience and conscientiousness. Theories in political psychology induce that one's combination of these traits has implications for leadership style and capacity. For example, individuals who score highly on extroversion are demonstrated as having superior leadership skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Myers-Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment scale commonly used in the study of political personality and for job profiling.

===A motive-based approach===
In terms of political psychology [[motivation]] is viewed as goal-oriented behavior driven by a need for three things; [[Power (social and political)|power]], affiliation intimacy, and [[Goal#Achieving personal goals|achievement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories were grouped by Winter (1996) from Murray's (1938) twenty suggested common human goals. Need for power affects the style in which a leader performs. Winter and Stewart (1977) suggested that leaders high in power motivation and low in need of affiliation intimacy motivation make better presidents. Affiliation-motivated leaders alternatively tend to collaborate joint efforts in the absence of threat. Lastly, achievement motivation has demonstrated to not correspond with political success, especially if it is higher than power motivation (Winter, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.122)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation between a leader and those whom they are ruling needs to be consistent with success. Motives have been shown to be correlated more highly with situation and time since last goal-fulfillment, rather than consistent traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.132)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT) is commonly used for assessing motives. However, in the case of leadership assessment this test is more difficult to implement therefore more applicable tests are often used such as content analysis of speeches and interviews.

==Frameworks for assessing personality==

===The authoritarian personality===
The [[authoritarian personality]] is a syndrome theory that was developed by the researchers [[Adorno]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik|Frenkel-Brunswick]], [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] and [[Nevitt Sanford|Sanford]] (1950) at The University of California. The American Jewish Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jost, J.T., Sidanius, J.|year=2004 |title= Political Psychology: Key Readings (p.47)|edition=1st|publisher= London: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidized research and publishing on the theory since it revolved around ideas developed from World War II events. [[Adorno]] (1950) explained the authoritarian personality type from a psychoanalytic point of view suggesting it to be a result of highly controlled and conventional parenting. Adorno (1950) explained that individuals with an authoritarian personality type had been stunted in terms of developing an ability to control the sexual and aggressive id impulses. This resulted in a fear of them and thus a development of defense mechanisms to avoid confronting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.40)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian personality types are persons described as swinging between depending on yet resenting authority. The syndrome was theorized to encompass nine characteristics; conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intraception (an opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies), superstition and stereotypy, power and toughness, destructiveness and cynicism, sex obsession, and projectivity. The authoritarian personality type is suggested to be; ethnocentric, ego-defensive, mentally rigid, conforming and conventional, adverse to the out of the ordinary, and as having conservative political views. The book ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) introduces several scales based on different authoritarian personality types. These are; the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] which measures from where and to what degree fascist attitudes develop, the anti-Semitism scale, the ethnocentrism scale and the politico economic conservatism scale. The F-scale however, is the only scale that is expected to measure implicit authoritarian personality tendencies.

[[Bob Altemeyer]] (1996) deconstructed the authoritarian personality using trait analysis. He developed a [[Right-wing Authoritarianism]] (RWA) scale based on the traits; authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. Altmeyer (1996) suggested that those who score high on the F-scale have a low ability for critical thinking and therefore are less able to contradict authority. Altmeyer's theories also incorporate the psychodynamic point of view, suggesting that authoritarian personality types were taught by their parents to believe that the world was a dangerous place and thus their impulses lead them to make impulsive, emotional and irrational decisions. The beliefs and behavior of an authoritarian are suggested to be easily manipulated by authority instead of being based on internal values.  Altmeyer also theorized that leaders with authoritarian personality types were more susceptible to the [[fundamental attribution error]]. There are many weaknesses associated with this syndrome and the F-scale. It may have been more relevant during the period in which it was produced, being shortly after World War II. The authoritarian personality is generally related to a fascist image however it is suggested to explain behavior of individuals in all political fields.

===Trait-based frameworks===
Trait-based frameworks, excluding the Freudian approach, were suggested by [[James David Barber|James Barber]] (1930–2004) in ''The Presidential Character'' (1972) who highlighted the importance of [[psychobiography]] in political personality analysis. Barber suggested that leadership personality comprised three dimensions; "character", "world view", and "style".&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.28)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber also proposed that leadership typology followed a pattern leading from an individuals first political success and that it is includes two variables; the effort that a leader puts in and the personal satisfaction that the leader gains. This typology is fairly limited in its dimensions.

[[Etheredge]] (1978) proposed the importance of the traits; "dominance", "interpersonal trust", "self-esteem" and "introversion-extroversion", in leadership views and policy shaping. Etheredge found from studies on leaders during the Soviet Union, that those who scored highly on dominance were more likely to support the use of force during debate settlement. He found that the trait introversion can lead to a lack of co-operation, and that extroversion usually leads to cooperation and negotiation. Further he suggested that interpersonal trust and self-esteem were closely related to not advocating force.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28" /&gt;

[[Margaret Hermann]] (1976) introduced the [[Leader Trait Assessment]] (LTA) and advocated the development of the [[Profiler-Plus]]. The Profiler-Plus is a computer system used to code spontaneous interview answers for seven major characteristics; need for power, cognitive complexity, task-interpersonal emphasis, self-confidence, locus of control, distrust of others, and ethnocentrism. This method can profile large bodies of leadership related text whilst removing any subjective bias from content analysis. It is efficient and has high reliability.
Hermann and Preston (1994) suggested 5 distinct variables of leadership style; their involvement in policy making, their willingness to tolerate conflict, their level and reasons for motivation, their information managing strategies, and their conflict resolving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.30)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach is the [[Operational-Code]] method introduced by [[Nathan Leites]] (1951) and restructured by [[Alexander George (philosopher)|Alexander George]] (1979). The code is based on five philosophical beliefs and five instrumental beliefs. A [[Verbs in Context]] (VIC) coding system employed through the Profiler-Plus computer program once again allows substantial bodies of written and spoken speech, interviews and writings to be analyzed subjectively.  The method attempts to be able to predict behavior thorough applying knowledge of various beliefs.

Although political behavior is governed and represented by a leader the consequential influence of the leader largely depends upon the context in which they are placed and in which type of political climate they are running. For this reason group behavior is also instrumental for understanding sociopolitical environments

==The political psychology of groups==

[[Group behavior]] is key in understanding the structure, stability, popularity and ability to make successful decisions of political parties. Individual behavior deviates substantially in a group setting therefore it is difficult to determine group behavior by looking solely at the individuals that comprise the group. Group form and stability is based upon several variables; size, structure, the purpose that the group serves, group development and influences upon a group.

===Group size===
Group size has various consequences. In smaller groups individuals are more committed (Patterson and Schaeffer, 1997) and there is a lower turnover rate (Widmeyer, Brawley and Carron, 1990).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.67)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large groups display greater levels of divergence (O'Dell, 1968) and less conformity (Olson and Caddell, 1994). Group performance also diminishes with size increase, due to decreased co-ordination and free-riding.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; The size of a [[political party]] or nation can therefore have consequential effects on their ability to co-ordinate and progress.

===Group structure===
The structure of a group is altered by member diversity, which largely affects its efficiency. Individual diversity with in a group has proven to demonstrate less communication and therefore to increase conflict (Maznevski, 1994).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; This has implications for political parties based in strongly colonial or multiracial nations.
Member diversity has consequences for; status, role allocation and role strain within a group, all of which can cause disagreement. Thus maintenance of group cohesion is key. Cohesion is affected by several factors; the amount of time members spend in the group, the amount that members like one another, the amount of reward that the group offers, the amount of external threat to the group and the level of warmth offered by leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.69)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors should be considered when attempting to form an efficient political group. President decision efficiency for example is affected by the degree to which members of the advisory group have a hierarchical status and by the roles that each member is assigned.

===Group function===
Studying the purpose for formation of a group, whether it is serving a "functional" purpose or an "interpersonal attraction" purpose (Mackie and Goethals, 1987), has implications for political popularity. Often people join groups in order to fulfill certain survival, interpersonal, informational and collective needs.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt;  A political party that provides; stability, clear information, offers power to individuals and satisfies a sense of affiliation, will gain popularity. [[William Schutz|Shutz's]] (1958) "[[Fundamental interpersonal relations orientation]]" theory suggests that groups satisfy the need for control, intimacy and inclusion. Groups also form due to natural attraction. Newcomb (1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that we are drawn to others close in socioeconomic status, beliefs, attitudes and physical appearance. Similarity in certain respects can thus be related to how much a person is attracted to joining one group over another.

===Group development===
[[Group development]] tends to happen in several stages; forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning (Tuckman, 1965). Group awareness of these stages is important in order for members to acknowledge that a process is taking place and that certain stages such as storming are part of progression and that they should not be discouraged or cause fear of instability. Awareness of group development also allows for models to be implemented in order to manipulate different stages. External influences upon a group will have different effects depending upon which stage the group is at in its course. This has implications for how open a group should be depending upon the stage of development it is at, and on its strength.
Consistency is also a key aspect in a group for success (Wood, 1994).

===The influence of conformity in groups===
The application of conformity is key for understanding group influence in political behaviour. Decision making within a group is largely influenced by conformity. It is theorized to occur based on two motives; [[normative social influence]] and [[informational social influence]] (Asch, 1955).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.74)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance of conformity is influenced by several factors; an increase in group size but only to a certain degree at which it plateaus, and degree of unanimity and commitment to the group. Therefore, the degree of popularity of a political group can be influenced by its existing size and the believed unanimity and commitment by the public of the already existing members. The degree by which the group conforms as a whole can also be influenced by the degree of individuation of its members.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74" /&gt;
Also, the conformity within political groups can be related to the term, 'political coalition.' Humans represent groups as if there was a special category of an individual. For example, for cognitive simplicity, ancestral groups anthropomorphize each other because they have similar thoughts, values, and a historical background.  Even though the member of a group may have an irrational or wrong argument about a political issue, there is a high possibility for the other members to conform to it because of the mere fact that they are in the same coalition. &lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen, “States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics,” International Security, Vol. 36, No. 2, Fall 2011, pp. 48-83&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of power in groups===
Power is another influential factor within a group or between separate groups. The "critical bases of power" developed by French and Raven (1959) allocates the following types of power as the most successful; reward power, coercive power, legitimate power, [[referent power]] and expert power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.76)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The way in which power is exerted upon a group can have repercussive outcomes for popularity. Referent power results in greater popularity of a political group or leader than coercive power (Shaw and Condelli, 1986).&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.77)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for leaders to manipulate others to identify with them, rather than to enforce consequential punishment. However, if coercive power is enforced, success and a trusted leader (Friedland, 1976) are necessary in order for group conflict not to escalate.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt; Extrinsic punishment and reward are also suggested to detract from intrinsic motivation. A sense of freedom must be advocated to the group.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt;

===Decision-making in groups===
[[Decision-making]] is an important political process which influences the course of a country's policy. Group decision-making is largely influenced by three rules; "[[majority]]-wins rule", "[[truth]]-wins rule", and "first-shift rule". Decision-making is also coerced by [[conformity]]. [[Irrational]] decisions are generally made during emotional periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.83)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an unpopular political party may receive more votes during a period of actual or perceived economic or [[political instability]]. Controversial studies by George Marcus (2003) however imply that high levels of [[anxiety]] can actually cause an individual to analyze information more rationally and carefully, resulting in more well-informed and successful decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schildkraut |first=D. J. |title= All Politics is psychological: A Review of Political Psychology Syllabi |journal= Perspectives on Politics |date=December 2004 |volume=2 |pages=807–819 |url= http://ase.tufts.edu/polsci/faculty/schildkraut/Perspectives2004.pdf |accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= 10.1017/s1537592704040575|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychology of decision-making however must be analyzed in accordance with whether it is within a leadership context or a between group context. The implementation of successful decision-making is often enhanced by group decision-making (Hill, 1982) especially if the decision is important to the group and when the group has been working together for an extended period of time (Watson, Michaelson and Sharp, 1991). However groups can also hinder decision-making if a correct answer is not clear. Janis (1972) introduced the notion of [[Groupthink]] that advocates an increased chance of groups making faulty decisions under several conditions; strong group cohesion, isolation of group decision from public review, the presence of a directive leader in the group, and high stress levels.
[[Group polarization]] (Janis, 1972) suggests that group decision-making is often more extreme whether is it more risky or cautious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.84)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Groupthink" refers to "a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2015 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques to establish more effective decision making skills in political dimensions have been suggested. Hirt and Markman (1995) claim that implementing an individual in a group to find faults and to critique will enable the members to establish alternative view points. George (1980) suggested "multiple advocacy" which implements that a neutral person analyses the pros and cons of various advocate suggestions and thus makes an informed decision.

Applied psychology theories to improve productivity of political groups include implementing "[[team development]]" techniques, "quality circles" and autonomous work groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.81)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using psychology in the understanding of certain political behaviors==

===Evolution===

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] plays a significant role in understanding the state and people of how the current political regime came to be. It is an approach that focuses on the structure of human behavior claiming it’s dependence on the social and ecological environment. Developed through natural selection, the human brain functions to react appropriately to environmental challenges of coalitional conflict using psychological mechanisms and modifications. An example of political conflict would involve state aggression such as war. Psychological mechanisms work to digest what is taken in from internal and external information regarding the current habitat and project it in the most suited form of action such as acts of aggression, retrieval, dominance, and so forth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anthony C. Lopez |author2=Rose McDermott |author3=Michael Bang Petersen |authorlink1=States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |title= States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |volume=36 |issue=2 fall 2011 |pages=48-83 |publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting behavior===

In order to make inferences and predictions about behavior concerning voting decision, certain key public influences must be considered. These influences include the role of emotions, political socialization, [[political sophistication]], tolerance of diversity of political views and the media. The effect of these influences on [[voting behavior]] is best understood through theories on the formation of attitudes, beliefs, schema, knowledge structures and the practice of information processing. The degree to which voting decision is affected by internal processing systems of political information and external influences, alters the quality of making truly democratic decisions.

===Conflict===

The application of psychology for understanding conflict and extreme acts of violence can be understood in both individual and group terms. Political conflict is often a consequence of ethnic disparity and "ethnocentrism" Sumner (1906).

On an individual level participators in situations of conflict can either be perpetrators, bystanders or altruists. The behavior of perpetrators is often explained through the authoritarian personality type. Individual differences in levels of empathy have been used to explain whether an individual chooses to stand up to authority or ignore a conflict. Rotter's (1954) [[locus of control]] theory in personality psychology has also been used to determine individual differences in reaction to situations of conflict.

Group behavior during conflict often affects the actions of an individual. The [[bystander effect]] introduced by Darley and Latane (1968) demonstrates that group behavior causes individuals to monitor whether others think it is necessary to react in a situation and thus base their behavior on this judgment. They also found that individuals are more likely to diffuse responsibility in group situations. These theories can be applied to situations of conflict and genocide in which individuals remove personal responsibility and therefore justify their behavior. [[Social identity theory]] explains that during the Holocaust of World War II political leaders used the Jews as an out-group in order to increase in-group cohesion. This allowed for the perpetrators to depersonalize from the situation and to diffuse their responsibility. The out-groups were held in separate confines and dehumanized in order to aid the in-group to disengage themselves from relating.

Research by Dr. Dan Kahan has demonstrated that individuals are resistant to accepting new political views even if they are presented with evidence that challenges their views.  The research also demonstrated that if the individual was required to write a few sentences about experiences they enjoyed or spend a few moments affirming their self-worth, the individual was more likely to accept the new political position.&lt;ref&gt;Motivated Numeracy and Enlightened Self-Government. retrieved on August 25, 2014. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992&lt;/ref&gt;

Although somewhat unusual, [[evolutionary psychology]] can also explain conflicts in politics and the international society. A journal by Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott and Michael Bang Petersen uses this idea to give out hypothesis to explain political events. According to the authors, instincts and psychological characteristics developed through evolution is still existent with modern people. They suggest human being as "adaptation executers"; people designed through natural selection, and not "utility maximizers"; people who strive for utility in every moment. Though a group of people, perhaps those who are in the same political coalition, may seem as if they pursue a common utility maximization, it is difficult to generalize the theory of "utility maximizers" into a nation-view because people evolved in small groups. This approach helps scholars to explain seemingly irrational behaviors like aggressiveness in politics and international society because "irrational behavior" would be the result of a mismatch between the modern world and evolutionary psychology.

For example, according to evolutionary psychology, coalitional aggression is more commonly found with males. This is because of their [[psychological mechanism]] designed since ancestral times. During those times men had more to earn when winning wars compared to women (they had more chance of finding a mate, or even many mates). Also, the victorious men had more chance of reproduction which eventually led to the succession of aggressive, eager-to-war DNAs. As a result, the authors hypothesize that countries with more men will tend to show more aggressive politics thereby having more possibility of triggering conflicts within and especially among states.

Indeed some exceptions do exists in this theory as this is just a hypothesis. However it is viable enough to be a hypothesis to be tested to explain certain political events like war and crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen. "States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics"." International Security 36.2 (2011): 48-83. 20 Sept 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===

On an individual level terrorism has been explained as a display of psychopathological personality disorders. Terrorists have demonstrated to show narcissistic personality traits (Lasch, 1979, Pearlstein, 1991). Post (2004) argues that narcissistic and borderline personality disorders are found in terrorists and that mechanisms such as [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] and [[externalization]] are used by terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.271)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Silke (2004) and Mastors and Deffenbaugh (2007) refute this view. Crenshaw (2004) showed that certain terrorist groups are actually careful in not enlisting those demonstrating pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.272)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[authoritarian personality]] theory has also been used as an explanation for terrorist behavior in individuals.

In terms of explaining reasons for which individuals join terrorist groups, motivational theories such as need for power and need for affiliation intimacy are suggested. Festinger (1954) explained that people often join groups in order to compare their own beliefs and attitudes. Joining a terrorist group could be a method to remedy individual uncertainty. Taylor and Louis (2004) explained that individuals strive for meaningful behavior. This can also be used to explain why terrorists look for such radical beliefs and demonstrations. Studies on children in northern Ireland by Field (1979) have shown that exposure to violence can lead to terrorist behavior later on. Implicating the effect of developing acceptable norms in groups. However this view has also been criticized (Taylor, 1998). Other theories suggest that goal frustration can result in aggression (Dollard, Doob. Miller, mower, and Sears, 1939)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.273)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aggression can lead to frustration (Borum, 2004).
Group settings can cause a social identity and terrorist behavior to manifest. Methods such as dehumanization allow individuals to detach more easily from moral responsibility, and group influence increase the chance that individuals will concede to conformity and compliance. Manipulations of social control and propaganda can also instrument terrorist involvement.

In fact, a strategic model has been proposed to examine the political motivations of terrorists. The strategic model, the dominant paradigm in terrorism studies, considers terrorists are rational actors who attack civilians for political ends. According to this view, terrorists are political utility maximizers. The strategic model rests on three core assumptions which are: (1)terrorists are motivated by relatively stable and consistent political preferences; (2)terrorists evaluate the expected political payoffs of their available options; and (3)terrorism is adopted when the expected political return is superior to those of alternative options. However, it turns out that terrorists' decision-making process does not fully conform to the strategic model. According to Abrahms, Max who is the author of "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and [[Counterterrorism]] Strategy." &lt;ref&gt;Abrahms, Max. "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy." International Security, vol. 32 no. 4, 2008, pp. 78-105. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/237009&lt;/ref&gt;there are seven common tendencies that represent important empirical puzzles for the strategic model, going against the conventional thought that terrorists are rational actors.

The term '''political radicalism''' (in [[political science]] known as [[Radicalization|radicalism]]) denotes [[Politics|political]] principles focused on [[Social change|altering]] [[social structure]]s through [[revolution]]ary or other means and changing [[Value (ethics)|value systems]] in fundamental ways.

Derived from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|[[wikt:radix#Latin|radix]]}} ("root"), the denotation of radical has changed since its eighteenth-century coinage to comprehend the entire political spectrum—yet it retains the "change at the root" connotation fundamental to [[revolutionary]] societal change. Historically, [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] has referred exclusively to the radical left (under the single category of [[far-left politics]]) and rarely incorporating [[far-right politics]]—though these may have [[revolutionary]] elements. The prominent exception is in the [[United States of America|United States]], where some{{quantify|date=January 2017}}{{who|date=August 2018}} consider radicalism to include both political extremes of the radical left and the [[Radical right (United States)|radical right]]. In traditional labels of the spectrum of political thought, the opposite of radical – on the "[[Right-wing politics|right]]" of the political spectrum – is termed "[[reactionary]]".

The nineteenth-century ''[[Cyclopaedia of Political Science]]'' (1881, 1889) reports that "radicalism is characterized less by its principles than by the manner of their application".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cyclopaedia of Political Science]], Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States'', 1893, [https://books.google.com/books?id=l-J3vOPWd50C&amp;pg=PA492&amp;dq=%22radicalism+is%22&amp;lr= p. 492, article "Radicalism"], by [[Maurice Block]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] often used the term "radical" [[pejorative]]ly whereas contemporary left radicals used the term "conservative" derogatorily,&lt;ref&gt;Mike Sanders (ed.) (2001), ''Women and Radicalism in the Nineteenth Century'', {{ISBN|0-415-20526-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9W4ucbBfkoQC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq=%22radicalism+is%22&amp;lr=&amp;sig=lPpumOh7NWu_qt7zy1AiQP5rCcM "General Introduction"].&lt;/ref&gt; thus contemporary denotations of "radical", "radicalism" and "political radicalism" comprise far-left ([[hard left]],&lt;ref name="March2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luke March|title=Radical Left Parties in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xF3FBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1724|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-57897-7|page= 1724}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[radicalism (historical)|radical left]])&lt;ref&gt;Edward Walter (1992), ''The Rise and Fall of Leftist Radicalism in America'', {{ISBN|0-275-94276-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and far-right ([[Far-right politics|hard right]], [[Far-right politics|radical right]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Abcarian (1971), ''American Political Radicalism: Contemporary Issues and Orientations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' records the first political usage of "radical" as ascribed to the [[Whigs (British political party)|British Whig Party]] [[Parliament of England|parliamentarian]] [[Charles James Fox]], who in 1797 proposed a "radical reform" of the [[electoral system]], [[Suffrage|franchise]] to provide [[universal manhood suffrage]], thereby [[idiom]]atically establishing "radical" to denote supporters of the reformation of the British Parliament. Throughout the nineteenth century, the term was combined{{by whom?|date=January 2017}} with political notions and doctrines, thus producing the concepts of [[working class]] radicalism, [[middle class]]-, philosophic-, democratic- [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]-, [[Tory]]- and plebeian radicalism. In the event, politically influential radical leaders give rise to their own trend of political radicalism (see [[Thomas Spence|Spencean radicalism]] and [[Richard Carlile|Carlilean radicalism]]). Philosophically, the French political scientist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) is the principal theoretician proposing "political radicalism" as feasible in [[republic]]an [[political philosophy]], ''[[Viz.|viz]]'' the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) and other modern revolutions—the antithesis to the [[liberalism]] of [[John Locke]] (1632–1704).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/10969/Radicals-Radicalism-Radical-Liberalism.html|title=Radicals/Radicalism - Radical Liberalism|author=&lt;!-- Not stated. --&gt;|date=|website=science.jrank.org|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Praetorianism''' means excessive or abusive [[Politics|political]] influence of the [[Armed Forces]] in a country.

[[Daniel R. Headrick]], professor of History and Social Sciences at [[Roosevelt University]], describes praetorianism as a type of [[militarism]] oriented to the interior life of a nation, often related to minor countries, that does not aspire to fight or win international wars, but instead to maintain its influence in the domestic political system, controlling decisions that could affect the interests of the military as a corporation, or supporting some particular political faction or party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Real freedom''' is a term coined by the [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] and [[economist]] [[Philippe Van Parijs]]. It expands upon notions of [[negative freedom]] by incorporating not simply institutional or other constraints on a person's choices, but also the requirements of physical reality, resources and personal capacity. To have real freedom, according to Van Parjis, an individual must:

:1. not be prevented from acting on their will (i.e. they must have traditional negative freedom)
:2. possess the resources or capacities actually to carry out their will.

Under this conception, a [[moral agent]] could be ''negatively'' free to take a holiday in [[Miami]], because no-one is forcing them not to (condition 1 is met); but not ''really'' free to do so, because they cannot afford the flight (condition 2 is not met). Similarly, someone could be negatively free to swim across the [[English Channel]]; but not really free, because they are not a good enough swimmer and would not be able to succeed in the task. Real freedom is, then, a matter of ''degree'' — one is more or less really free, not just either really free or not; and no-one has ''complete'' real freedom — no-one is currently really free to [[Teleportation|teleport]] to [[Mars]], for instance.

Real freedom expands on negative freedom by adding the idea of actually being able to exercise a capacity or resource in the absence of constraint; but does not go as far as some ideas of positive freedom, by refraining from appeal to self-government by a real, best, or higher self.

Van Parijs uses the concept of real freedom as part of his influential argument for a [[universal basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philippe |last=Van Parijs |title=Real Freedom For All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism? |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "reconquest") is a name used in English to describe the period in the history of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] of about 780 years between the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in 711 and the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada]] to the expanding [[Christendom|Christian kingdoms]] in 1491. The completed [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] was the context of the Spanish voyages of discovery and conquest (Columbus got royal support in Granada in 1492, months after its conquest), and the [[Americas]]—the "[[New World]]"—ushered in the era of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colonial empires.

Traditional historiography has marked the beginning of the ''{{lang|es|Reconquista}}'' with the [[Battle of Covadonga]] (718 or 722), the first known victory in Iberia by Christian military forces since the 711 military intervention in Iberia of combined Arab-Berber forces. In that small battle, a group led by the nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] defeated a Muslim patrol in the mountains of northern Iberia and established the independent Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. It ended with the conquest of the [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim state in the peninsula, in 1491.

After 1491, the entire peninsula was controlled by Christian rulers. The conquest was followed by the [[Alhambra Decree]] (1492) which expelled Jews who would not convert to Christianity from Castile and Aragon, and a series of edicts (1499–1526) which [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|forced the conversions of the Muslims in Spain]]. Since the mid-19th century, the idea of a 'reconquest' took hold in Spain associated with its rising [[nationalism]] and [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Concept and duration==
Traditional [[historiography]] has stressed since the 19th century the existence of the ''Reconquista'',&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García Fitz|first1=Francisco|date=2009|title=La Reconquista: un estado de la cuestión|url=http://www.durango-udala.net/portalDurango/RecursosWeb/DOCUMENTOS/1/1_1945_3.pdf|journal=Clío &amp; Crímen: Revista del Centro de Historia del Crimen de Durango |language=es|volume=|issue=6|pages=142–215|doi=|issn=1698-4374}}&lt;/ref&gt; a continuous phenomenon by which the Christian Iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the Muslim kingdoms, understood as a common enemy who had militarily seized territory from native Iberian Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |authorlink= Rosamond McKitterick |year= 2003 |publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0812236965|page= 19|accessdate=February 15, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4gVIt5u0U5wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of a Christian reconquest of the peninsula first emerged, in tenuous form, at the end of the 9th century.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMedieval&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Cambridge Medieval.

[[File:Almohad1200.png|thumb|The [[Islami]]c [[Almohad dynasty]] and surrounding states, including the Christian Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and the [[Crown of Aragon]], c. 1200.]]

Both Christian and Muslim rulers fought amongst themselves. Alliances between Muslims and Christians were not uncommon.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMedieval/&gt; Blurring distinctions even further were the mercenaries from both sides who simply fought for whoever paid the most. The period is seen today to have had long episodes of relative religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;María Rosa Menocal, ''The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain'', Back Bay Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0316168718}}, and see [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crusades]], which started late in the 11–12th century, bred the religious ideology of a Christian reconquest, confronted at that time with a similarly staunch Muslim [[Jihad]] ideology in [[Al-Andalus]] by the [[Almoravids]], and to an even greater degree by the [[Almohads]]. In fact, previous documents from the 10th and 11th centuries are mute on any idea of "reconquest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Callaghan|first=Joseph F.|title=Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fPSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=October 23, 2017|year=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0306-6|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda accounts of Muslim-Christian hostility came into being to support that idea, most notably the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', a fictitious 11th-century French version of the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778)]] dealing with the Iberian ''[[Saracen]]s'' (''Moors''), and taught as historical fact in the French educational system since 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Pagans are wrong and Christians are right': Alterity, Gender, and Nation in the ''Chanson de Roland''|last=Kinoshita|first=Sharon|journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies|volume=31|issue=1|date=Winter 2001|pages=79–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiVanna |first1=Isabel N. |year=2010 |title=Politicizing national literature: the scholarly debate around La Chanson de Roland in the nineteenth century |journal=Historical Research |volume=84 |issue=223 |pages=109–134 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2009.00540.x |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern idea of the earlier concept of ''Reconquista'' is inextricably linked to the foundational myths of [[Spanish nationalism]] in the 19th century, and consolidated by the mid-20th century during [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[National-Catholicism|National-Catholic]] dictatorship, based on a strong underlying Castilian ideological element.&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"&gt;García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a "liberation war" of ''reconquest'' against the Muslims, depicted as foreigners, suited well the anti-Republican rebels during the [[Spanish Civil War]] who agitated for the banner of a Spanish fatherland threatened by regional nationalisms and communism.&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"/&gt; Their rebellious pursuit was thus a crusade for the restoration of the Church's unity, where Franco stood for both [[Pelagius of Asturias]] and [[El Cid]].&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"/&gt;

Some contemporary authors consider it proved that the process of Christian state-building in Iberia was indeed often defined by the reclamation of lands that had been lost to the [[Moors]] in generations past. In this way, state-building might be characterised—at least in ideological, if not practical, terms—as a process by which Iberian states were being 'rebuilt'.&lt;ref name="Purkis"&gt;{{cite book |title= Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Perspectives on State Building in the Iberian Peninsula |last=Purkis |first=William J. |year= 2010 |publisher= University of Birmingham |pages= 57–58|accessdate=October 15, 2017|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2010-05_W._J._Purkis,_Eleventh-_and_Twelfth-Century_Perspectives_on_State_Building_in_the_Iberian_Peninsula.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In turn, other recent historians dispute the whole concept of ''Reconquista'' as a concept created ''a posteriori'' in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically reconquering them, as the name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Eugènia de Pagès, "''La 'Reconquista', allò que mai no va existir''", ''La Lamentable'', July 11, 2014, [http://lamentable.org/la-reconquista-allo-que-mai-no-va-existir/ lamentable.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martín M.

Quoted by De Pagès, E. July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is still widely in use.

== Background ==
{{Further|Islam in Spain}}

===Islamic conquest of Christian Iberia===
{{Further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Battle of Guadalete}}

In 711, Muslim [[Moors]], mainly North African [[Berber people|Berber]] soldiers with some [[Arab]]s, crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and began their conquest of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania]]. After their conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom's Iberian territories, the Muslims crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and took control of [[Septimania]] in 719, the last province of the Visigothic Kingdom to be occupied. From their stronghold of [[Narbonne]], they launched raids into the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].

The invading Islamic armies did not exceed 60,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard|title=Moorish Spain|year=2006|publisher=Los Angeles: University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24840-3|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; These armies established an Islamic rule known as [[Al-Andalus]] that would last 300 years in much of the Iberian Peninsula and 770 years in [[Granada]].

===Islamic rule===
{{Main article|Berbers and Islam|Berber Revolt|}}

After the establishment of a local [[Emirate]], [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]], ruler of the [[Umayyad|Umayyad caliphate]], removed many of the successful Muslim commanders. [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the first governor of the newly conquered province of Al-Andalus, was recalled to [[Damascus]] and replaced with Musa bin Nusair, who had been his former superior. Musa's son, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, apparently married [[Egilona]], [[Roderic]]'s widow, and established his regional government in [[Seville]]. He was suspected of being under the influence of his wife and was accused of wanting to convert to Christianity and of planning a secessionist rebellion. Apparently a concerned Al-Walid I ordered Abd al-Aziz's assassination. Caliph Al-Walid I died in 715 and was succeeded by his brother [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]]. Sulayman seems to have punished the surviving Musa bin Nusair, who very soon died during a pilgrimage in 716. In the end, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa's cousin, [[Ayyub ibn Habib al-Lakhmi]] became the [[emir]] of ''Al-Andalus''.

The conquering generals were necessarily acting independently, due to the methods of communication available. Successful generals in the field and in a distant province would gain the personal loyalty of their officers and warriors and their ambitions were likely watched by certain circles of the distant government with a degree of concern and suspicion. Old rivalries and perhaps even full-fledged conspiracies between generals may have had influence over this development. In the end, the formerly successful generals were replaced by a younger generation considered more loyal to the government in Damascus.

A serious weakness amongst the Muslim conquerors was the ethnic tension between Berbers and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Lowney]], ''A Vanished World: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Medieval Spain'', (Oxford University Press, 2005), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Berbers were indigenous inhabitants of North Africa who had only recently converted to Islam; they provided most of the soldiery of the invading Islamic armies but sensed Arab discrimination against them.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Spain'', (St.Martin's Press, 1995), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; This latent internal conflict jeopardized Muslim unity.

After the Islamic Moorish conquest of most of the Iberian Peninsula in 711–718 and the establishment of the emirate of Al-Andalus, an Umayyad expedition suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] and was halted for a while on its way north. [[Odo of Aquitaine]] had married his daughter to [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], a rebel Berber and lord of [[Cerdanya]] (and, perhaps, contemporary Catalonia), in an attempt to secure his southern borders in order to fend off [[Charles Martel]]'s attacks on the north. However, a major [[punitive expedition]] led by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman, and the Muslim governor mustered an expedition north across the western Pyrenees, looted areas up to Bordeaux, and defeated Odo in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] in 732.

A desperate Odo turned to his archrival Charles Martel for help, who led the Frankish and remaining Aquitanian armies against the Umayyad armies and defeated them at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732, killing Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. While Moorish rule began to recede, it would remain in parts of the Iberian peninsula for another 760 years.

==Reconquista==
=== Beginning of the ''Reconquista'' ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Asturias}}
[[File:Escudo de Alcanadre-La Rioja.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Coat of arms of [[Alcanadre]]. [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain. Depicting [[Maure|heads of slain Moors]]]]
The first victory in resistance to Muslim rule occurred in [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] in 722. A drastic increase of taxes by the emir [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]] provoked several rebellions in Al-Andalus, which a series of succeeding weak emirs were unable to suppress. Around 722, a Muslim military expedition was sent into the north in late summer to suppress a rebellion led by [[Pelagius of Asturias]] (Pelayo in Spanish, Pelayu in Asturian). Traditional historiography has hailed Pelagius' [[Battle of Covadonga|victory at Covadonga]] as the beginning of the ''Reconquista''. No Muslim source mentions the battle at Covadonga, in contrast with the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721, with a death toll of perhaps tens of thousands, which was mourned for centuries as a large scale tragedy by the Iberian Muslims. For Pelagius, however, the Christian victory secured his independent rule, while the precise date and circumstances of the battle are unclear. Among the possibilities is that Pelagius' rebellion was successful because the greater part of the Muslim forces were focusing in [[Septimania]] and Toulouse (721).

Two northern realms, the Basque Navarre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Asturias, despite their small size, demonstrated an ability to maintain their independence. Because the Umayyad rulers based in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] were unable to extend their power over the Pyrenees, they decided to consolidate their power within the Iberian peninsula. Arab-Berber forces made periodic incursions deep into Asturias, but this area was a ''cul-de-sac'' on the fringes of the Islamic world fraught with inconveniences during campaigns and little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It comes then as no surprise that, besides focusing on raiding the Arab-Berber strongholds of the Meseta, Alphonse I centred on expanding his domains at the expense of the neighbouring Galicians and Basques at either side of his realm just as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=156, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decades, Asturian control over part of the kingdom was weak, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances and war with other peoples from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. After Pelayo's death in 737, his son [[Favila of Asturias]] was elected king. Favila, according to the chronicles, was killed by a bear during a trial of courage. Pelayo's dynasty in Asturias survived and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries until all of northwest Iberia was included by roughly 775. However, credit is due not to him but to his successors, the ''Banu Alfons'' from the Arab chronicles. Further expansion of the northwestern kingdom towards the south occurred during the reign of Alfonso II (from 791–842). A king's expedition arrived in and pillaged Lisbon in 798, probably concerted with the Carolingians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asturian kingdom became firmly established with the recognition of Alfonso II as king of Asturias by [[Charlemagne]] and the Pope. During his reign, the bones of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James the Great]] were declared to have been found in Galicia, at [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a channel of communication between the isolated Asturias and the Carolingian lands and beyond, centuries later.

===Franks and Al-Andalus===
{{Main article|Islamic invasion of Gaul|Marca Hispanica}}

After the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian heartland of the Visigothic kingdom, the Muslims crossed the Pyrenees and gradually took control of [[Septimania]], starting in 719 with the conquest of [[Narbonne]] through 725 when [[Carcassone]] and [[Nîmes]] were secured. From the stronghold of Narbonne, they tried to conquer [[Aquitaine]] but suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)]].&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"&gt;{{cite book |title=

Ten years after halting their advance north, [[Odo of Aquitaine]] married his daughter to [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], a rebel Berber and lord of [[Cerdanya]] (perhaps all of contemporary Catalonia as well), in an attempt to secure his southern borders to fend off [[Charles Martel]]'s attacks on the north. However, a major [[punitive expedition]] led by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt;

==== Pepin the Younger and Charlemagne ====
After expelling the Muslims [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|from Narbonne in 759]] and driving their forces back over the Pyrenees, the Carolingian king [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|Pepin the Short conquered Aquitaine]] in a ruthless eight-year war. Charlemagne followed his father by subduing Aquitaine by creating counties, taking the Church as his ally and appointing counts of Frankish or Burgundian stock, like his loyal [[William of Gellone]], making [[Toulouse]] his base for expeditions against Al-Andalus.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt; Charlemagne decided to organize a regional subkingdom in order to keep the Aquitanians in check and to secure the southern border of the [[Carolingian Empire]] against Muslim incursions. In 781, his three-year-old son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]] was crowned king of [[Aquitaine]], under the supervision of Charlemagne's trustee William of Gellone, and was nominally in charge of the incipient [[Spanish March]].&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the takeover of the southern fringes of Al-Andalus by Abd ar-Rahman I in 756 was opposed by [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman]], autonomous governor (''[[wāli]]'') or king (''malik'') of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman I expelled Yusuf from Cordova,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it took still decades for him to expand to the north-western Andalusian districts. He was also opposed externally by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] of Baghdad who failed in their attempts to overthrow him. In 778, Abd al-Rahman closed in on the Ebro valley. Regional lords saw the Umayyad emir at the gates and decided to enlist the nearby Christian Franks. According to [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], a Kurdish historian of the 12th century, Charlemagne received the envoys of [[Sulayman al-Arabi]], Husayn, and [[Abu Taur of Huesca|Abu Taur]] at the Diet of Paderborn in 777. These rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Huesca]] were enemies of Abd ar-Rahman I, and in return for Frankish military aid against him offered their homage and allegiance.&lt;ref name="Collins, Roger 1989 177–181"&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne, seeing an opportunity, agreed upon an expedition and crossed the Pyrenees in 778. Near the city of [[Zaragoza]] Charlemagne received the homage of [[Sulayman al-Arabi]]. However the city, under the leadership of [[Husayn of Zaragoza|Husayn]], closed its gates and refused to submit.&lt;ref name="Collins, Roger 1989 177–181"/&gt; Unable to conquer the city by force, Charlemagne decided to retreat. On the way home the rearguard of the army was ambushed and destroyed by Basque forces at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]. [[The Song of Roland]], a highly romanticized account of this battle, would later become one of the most famous [[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]] of the Middle Ages. Around 788 Abd ar-Rahman I died and was succeeded by [[Hisham I of Córdoba|Hisham I]]. In 792 Hisham proclaimed a [[jihad]], advancing in 793 against the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and Carolingian [[Septimania|Septimania (Gothia)]]. They defeated William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse, in battle, but [[William of Gellone|William]] led an expedition the following year across the eastern Pyrenees. [[Barcelona]], a major city, became a potential target for the Franks in 797, as its governor Zeid rebelled against the Umayyad emir of Córdoba. An army of the emir managed to recapture it in 799, but Louis, at the head of an army, crossed the Pyrenees and besieged the city for two years until it finally capitulated in 801.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 37-49"&gt;{{cite book |title=

The main passes in the Pyrenees were [[Roncesvalles]], [[Somport]] and [[La Jonquera]]. Charlemagne established across them the vassal regions of [[Pamplona]], [[Aragon]], and [[Catalonia]] respectively. Catalonia was itself formed from a number of [[Catalan counties|small counties]], including [[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[Girona (province)|Girona]], and [[Urgell]]; it was called the ''Marca Hispanica'' by the late 8th century. They protected the eastern Pyrenees passes and shores and were under the direct control of the Frankish kings. Pamplona's first king was [[Iñigo Arista]], who allied with his Muslim kinsmen the [[Banu Qasi]] and rebelled against Frankish overlordship and overcame a [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|Carolingian expedition in 824]] that led to the setup of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. Aragon, founded in 809 by [[Aznar Galíndez]], grew around [[Jaca]] and the high valleys of the [[Aragon River]], protecting the old Roman road. By the end of the 10th century, Aragon was annexed by Navarre. Sobrarbe and Ribagorza were small counties and had little significance to the progress of the ''Reconquista''.

In the late 9th century under [[Wilfred the Hairy, Count of Barcelona|Count Wilfred]], Barcelona became the ''de facto'' capital of the region. It controlled the other counties' policies in a union, which led in 948 to the independence of Barcelona under [[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Count Borrel II]], who declared that the new dynasty in France (the [[Capet]]s) were not the legitimate rulers of France nor, as a result, of his county. These states were small and, with the exception of Navarre, did not have the capacity for attacking the Muslims in the way that Asturias did, but their mountainous geography rendered them relatively safe from being conquered, and their borders remained stable for two centuries.

===Expansion into the Crusades and military orders===
[[File:Cantigas battle.jpg|thumb|A battle of the ''Reconquista'' from the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'']]
In the [[High Middle Ages]], the fight against the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula became linked to the fight of the whole of [[Christendom]]. The ''Reconquista'' was originally a mere war of conquest. It only later underwent a significant shift in meaning toward a religiously justified war of liberation (see the Augustinian concept of a [[Just War]]). The [[papacy]] and the influential [[Abbey of Cluny]] in Burgundy not only justified the acts of war but actively encouraged Christian knights to seek armed confrontation with Moorish "infidels" instead of with each other.

From the 11th century onwards [[indulgences]] were granted: In 1064 [[Pope Alexander II]] promised the participants of [[War of Barbastro|an expedition against Barbastro]] (''Tagr al-Andalus'', Aragon) a collective indulgence 30 years before [[Pope Urban II]] called the [[First Crusade]]. Papal interest in Christian-Muslim relations in the peninsula was not without precedent&amp;nbsp;– Popes Leo IV (847–855), John VIII (872–882) and John XIX (1024–33) are all known to have displayed substantial interest in the region. Not until 1095 and the [[Council of Clermont]] did the ''Reconquista'' amalgamate the conflicting concepts of a peaceful pilgrimage and armed knight-errantry. But the papacy left no doubt about the heavenly reward for knights fighting for Christ (''militia Christi''): in a letter, Urban II tried to persuade the ''reconquistadores'' fighting at [[Tarragona]] to stay in the Peninsula rather than joining the armed pilgrimage to conquer Jerusalem, saying that their contribution for Christianity was equally important. The pope promised them the same indulgences that he had promised to those who chose to join the First Crusade.

Later [[Military order (society)|military orders]] such as the [[Order of Santiago]], [[Order of Montesa|Montesa]], [[Order of Calatrava]], and the [[Knights Templar]] were founded or called to fight in Iberia. The Popes called the knights of Europe to join the effort to destroy the Muslim states of the peninsula. After the so-called [[Battle of Alarcos|Disaster of Alarcos]], French, Navarrese, Castilian, Portuguese and Aragonese armies united against the Muslim forces in the massive ''[[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]'' (1212). The large territories awarded to military orders and nobles were the origin of the [[latifundia]] in today's [[Andalusia]] and [[Extremadura]] in Spain, and [[Alentejo]] in Portugal.

==Military culture in medieval Iberia==

In an atmosphere of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly intertwined during this period. Small, lightly equipped armies reflected the need for society to be on constant alert. These forces were capable of moving long distances in short times, allowing a quick return home after sacking a target. Battles were mainly waged between clans, expelling intruder armies or sacking expeditions.

In the context of the relative isolation of the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Europe, and the contact with Moorish culture, geographical and cultural differences necessitated the use of military strategies, tactics, and equipment that were markedly different from those found in the rest of western Europe during this period.

Medieval Iberian armies mainly comprised two types of forces: the cavalry (mostly nobles, but including commoner knights from the 10th century on) and the infantry, or ''peones'' (peasants). Infantry only went to war if needed, which was not frequent.

=== Cavalry and infantry ===
Iberian [[cavalry tactics]] involved knights approaching the enemy, throwing [[javelin]]s, then withdrawing to a safe distance before commencing another assault. Once the enemy formation was sufficiently weakened, the knights charged with thrusting [[spear]]s ([[lance]]s did not arrive in Hispania until the 11th century). There were three types of knights (''caballeros''): royal knights, noble knights (''caballeros [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgos]]''), and commoner knights (''caballeros villanos'', or "mounted soldier from a [[Villa#Post-Roman era|villa]]"). Royal knights were mainly nobles with a close relationship with the king, and thus claimed a direct Gothic inheritance.

Royal knights were equipped in the same manner as their [[Goths|Gothic]] predecessors: mail [[hauberk]], kite shield, a long [[sword]] (designed to fight from the horse), javelins, spears and a [[francisca|Visigothic axe]]. Noble knights came from the ranks of the ''infanzones'' or lower nobles, whereas the commoner knights were not noble but were wealthy enough to afford a horse. Uniquely in Europe, these horsemen comprised a militia cavalry force with no feudal links, being under the sole control of the king or the count of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] because of ''[[fueros]]'' (charters) with the crown. Both noble and common knights wore padded armour and carried javelins, spears and round-tasselled shields (influenced by Moorish shields), as well as a sword.

The ''peones'' were [[peasants]] who went to battle in service of their [[feudal]] lord. Poorly equipped, with bows and arrows, spears and short swords, they were mainly used as auxiliary troops. Their function in battle was to contain the enemy troops until the cavalry arrived and to block the enemy infantry from charging the knights. The [[longbow]], the [[composite bow]], and the [[crossbow]] were the basic types of bows and were especially popular in the infantry.

Armour was typically made of leather, with iron scales; full coats of [[chain mail]] were extremely rare and horse [[barding]] completely unknown. Head protections consisted of a round helmet with nose protector (influenced by the designs used by [[Viking]]s, who attacked during the 8th and 9th centuries) and a chain mail headpiece. Shields were often round or kidney-shaped, except for the kite-shaped designs used by the royal knights. Usually adorned with geometric designs, crosses or tassels, shields were made out of wood and had a leather cover.

Steel swords were the most common weapon. The cavalry used long double-edged swords and the infantry short, single-edged ones. Guards were either semicircular or straight, but always highly ornamented with geometrical patterns. Spears and javelins were up to 1.5 metres long and had an iron tip. The double-axe – made of iron, 30&amp;nbsp;cm long, and possessing an extremely sharp edge – was designed to be equally useful as a thrown weapon or in close combat. Maces and hammers were not common, but some specimens have remained and are thought to have been used by members of the cavalry.

Finally, mercenaries were an important factor, as many kings did not have enough soldiers available. [[Norsemen]], [[Flemings|Flemish]] spearmen, Frankish knights, Moorish mounted archers, and Berber light cavalry were the main types of mercenaries available and used in the conflict.

=== Technological changes ===
This style of warfare remained dominant in the Iberian Peninsula until the late 11th century, when lance tactics entered from France, although the traditional horse javelin-shot techniques continued to be used. In the 12th and 13th centuries, soldiers typically carried a sword, a lance, a javelin, and either bow and arrows or crossbow and darts/bolts. Armor consisted of a coat of mail over a quilted jacket, extending at least to the knees, a helmet or iron cap, and bracers protecting the arms and thighs, either metal or leather.

Shields were round or triangular, made of wood, covered with leather, and protected by an iron band; the shields of knights and nobles would bear the family's coat of arms. Knights rode in both the Muslim style, ''a la jineta'' (i.e. the equivalent of a modern jockey's seat), a short stirrup strap and bended knees allowed for better control and speed, or in the French style, ''a la brida'', a long stirrup strap allowed for more security in the saddle (i.e. the equivalent of the modern cavalry seat, which is more secure) when acting as heavy cavalry. Horses were occasionally fitted with a coat of mail as well.

==Northern Christian realms==
The northern principalities and kingdoms survived in their mountainous strongholds (see above). However, they started a definite territorial expansion south at the turn of the 10th century (Leon, Najera). The fall of the Caliphate of Cordova (1031) heralded a period of military expansion for the northern kingdoms, now divided into several mighty regional powers after the division of the Kingdom of Navarre (1035). A myriad of autonomous Christian kingdoms emerged thereafter.

===Kingdom of Asturias (718–924)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Asturias}}
{{See also|Kingdom of Galicia}}
{{See also|Duchy of Cantabria}}
The Kingdom of Asturias was located in the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], a wet and mountainous region in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. It was the first Christian power to emerge. The kingdom was established by a nobleman, [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] (''Pelayo''), who had possibly returned after the Battle of Guadalete in 711 and was elected leader of the Asturians, laying the foundations for the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and starting the [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] that spanned from 718 to 1037 and led the initial efforts in the Iberian peninsula to take back the territories then ruled by the Moors.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz De La Peña. La monarquia asturiana 718–910, p. 27. Cangas de Onís, 2000. {{ISBN|9788460630364}} / Fernández Conde. Estudios Sobre La Monarquía Asturiana, pp. 35–76. Estudios Históricos La Olmeda, 2015. {{ISBN|9788497048057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the new dynasty first ruled in the mountains of Asturias, with the capital of the kingdom established initially in [[Cangas de Onís]], and was in its dawn mostly concerned with securing the territory and settling the monarchy, the latest kings (particularly [[Alfonso III of Asturias]]) emphasized the nature of the new kingdom as heir of that in [[Visigothic Kingdom|Toledo]] and the restoration of the Visigothic nation in order to vindicate the expansion to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Casariego, J.E.: Crónicas de los reinos de Asturias y León. Biblioteca Universitaria Everest, León 1985, p. 68. {{ASIN|B00I78R3S4}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such claims have been overall dismissed by modern historiography, emphasizing the distinct, autochthonous nature of the Cantabro-Asturian and Vasconic domains with no continuation to the Gothic Kingdom of Toledo.&lt;ref&gt;García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelagius' kingdom initially was little more than a gathering point for the existing guerrilla forces. During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelagius' daughter, was married to [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso]], [[Duchy of Cantabria|Dux Peter of Cantabria]]'s son. Alfonso's son [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] married Munia, a Basque from [[Álava]], after crushing a Basque uprising (probably resistance). Their son is reported to be [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]], while Alfonso I's daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.

Alfonso's military strategy was typical of Iberian warfare at the time. Lacking the means needed for wholesale conquest of large territories, his tactics consisted of raids in the border regions of [[Vardulia]]. With the plunder he gained further military forces could be paid, enabling him to raid the Muslim cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], and [[Coimbra]]. Alfonso I also expanded his realm westwards conquering [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

[[File:Painting of Santiago Matamoros.jpg|thumb|[[James, son of Zebedee#Spain|St James the Great]], depicted as [[Saint James Matamoros|Santiago Matamoros]] (Santiago the Moor-slayer)]]

During the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|King Alfonso II]] (791–842), the kingdom was firmly established, and a series of Muslim raids caused the transfer of the Asturian capital to [[Oviedo]]. The king is believed to have initiated diplomatic contacts with the kings of [[Pamplona]] and the [[Carolingian]]s, thereby gaining official recognition for his kingdom and his crown from the [[Pope]] and [[Charlemagne]].

The [[relic|bones]] of St. [[James the Great]] were proclaimed to have been found in Iria Flavia (present day [[Padrón]]) in 813 or probably two or three decades later. The cult of the saint was transferred later to [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]] (from Latin ''campus stellae'', literally "the star field"), possibly in the early 10th century when the focus of Asturian power moved from the mountains over to León, to become the [[Kingdom of León]] or Galicia-León. Santiago's were among many saint relics proclaimed to have been found across north-western Iberia. Pilgrims started to flow in from other Iberian Christian realms, sowing the seeds of the later [[Way of Saint James]] (11–12th century) that sparked the enthusiasm and religious zeal of continental [[Christian Europe]] for centuries.

Despite numerous battles, neither the Umayyads nor the Asturians had sufficient forces to secure control over these northern territories. Under the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro]], famed for the highly legendary [[Battle of Clavijo]], the border began to slowly move southward and Asturian holdings in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], Galicia, and [[León (province)|León]] were fortified, and an intensive program of re-population of the countryside began in those territories. In 924 the Kingdom of Asturias became the [[Kingdom of León]], when León became the seat of the royal court (it didn't bear any official name).

===Kingdom of León (910–1230)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of León|Kingdom of Galicia|County of Portugal}}
[[Alfonso III of Asturias]] repopulated the strategically important city [[León, Spain|León]] and established it as his capital. King Alfonso began a series of campaigns to establish control over all the lands north of the [[Douro]] river. He reorganized his territories into the major duchies ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and Portugal) and major counties ([[Saldaña, Palencia|Saldaña]] and Castile), and fortified the borders with many castles. At his death in 910 the shift in regional power was completed as the kingdom became the [[Kingdom of León]]. From this power base, his heir [[Ordoño II of León|Ordoño II]] was able to organize attacks against [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and even [[Seville]].

The [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] was gaining power, and began to attack León. King Ordoño allied with Navarre against Abd-al-Rahman, but they were [[battle of Valdejunquera|defeated in Valdejunquera]] in 920. For the next 80 years, the Kingdom of León suffered civil wars, Moorish attack, internal intrigues and assassinations, and the partial independence of Galicia and Castile, thus delaying the reconquest and weakening the Christian forces. It was not until the following century that the Christians started to see their conquests as part of a long-term effort to restore the unity of the Visigothic kingdom.

The only point during this period when the situation became hopeful for León was the reign of [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]]. King Ramiro, in alliance with [[Fernán González of Castile]] and his retinue of ''caballeros villanos'', [[battle of Simancas|defeated the Caliph in Simancas]] in 939. After this battle, when the Caliph barely escaped with his guard and the rest of the army was destroyed, King Ramiro obtained 12 years of peace, but he had to give González the independence of Castile as payment for his help in the battle. After this defeat, Moorish attacks abated until [[Almanzor]] began his campaigns. [[Alfonso V of León|Alfonso V]] finally regained control over his domains in 1002. Navarre, though attacked by Almanzor, remained intact.

The conquest of León did not include Galicia which was left to temporary independence after the withdrawal of the Leonese king. Galicia was conquered soon after (by Ferdinand, son of Sancho the Great, around 1038). However, this brief period of independence meant that Galicia remained a kingdom and fief of Leon, which is the reason it is part of Spain and not Portugal. Subsequent kings titled themselves kings of Galicia and León, instead of merely king of León as the two were united personally and not in union.

===Kingdom of Castile (1037–1230)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Castile}}
[[File:Alfonso VI reconquista Toledo.JPG|thumb|Ceramic of the conquest of Toledo by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI]]]]
[[Ferdinand I of León]] was the leading king of the mid-11th century. He conquered [[Coimbra]] and attacked the [[taifa]] kingdoms, often demanding the tributes known as [[parias]]. Ferdinand's strategy was to continue to demand parias until the taifa was greatly weakened both militarily and financially. He also repopulated the Borders with numerous ''fueros''. Following the Navarrese tradition, on his death in 1064 he divided his kingdom between his sons. His son [[Sancho II of Castile]] wanted to reunite the kingdom of his father and attacked his brothers, with a young noble at his side: Rodrigo Díaz, later known as [[El Cid Campeador]]. Sancho was killed in the siege of [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]] by the traitor Bellido Dolfos (also known as Vellido Adolfo) in 1072. His brother [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] took over León, Castile and Galicia.

Alfonso VI the Brave gave more power to the ''fueros'' and repopulated [[Segovia]], [[Ávila (province)|Ávila]] and [[Salamanca]]. Once he had secured the Borders, King Alfonso conquered the powerful [[Taifa of Toledo|Taifa kingdom of Toledo]] in 1085. [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which was the former capital of the Visigoths, was a very important landmark, and the conquest made Alfonso renowned throughout the Christian world. However, this "conquest" was conducted rather gradually, and mostly peacefully, during the course of several decades. It was not until after sporadic and consistent population resettlements had taken place that Toledo was decisively conquered.

Alfonso VI was first and foremost a tactful monarch who chose to understand the kings of taifa and employed unprecedented diplomatic measures to attain political feats before considering the use of force. He adopted the title ''[[Imperator totius Hispaniae]]'' ("Emperor of all [[Hispania]]", referring to all the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, and not just the modern country of Spain). Alfonso's more aggressive policy towards the taifas worried the rulers of those kingdoms, who called on the African [[Almoravid]]s for help.

=== Kingdom of Navarre (824–1620) ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Navarre}}
The [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] primarily extended along either side of the Pyrenees on the Atlantic Ocean. The kingdom was formed when local leader Íñigo Arista led a revolt against the regional Frankish authority and was elected or declared King in Pamplona (traditionally in 824), establishing a kingdom inextricably linked at this stage to their kinsmen, the [[muwallad]] [[Banu Qasi]] of Tudela.

Although relatively weak until the early 11th century, Pamplona took a more active role after the accession of [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho the Great]] (1004–1035). The kingdom expanded greatly under his reign, as it absorbed Castile, Leon, and what was to be Aragon, in addition to other small counties that would unite and become the Principality of Catalonia. This expansion also led to the independence of Galicia, as well as gaining overlordship over [[Gascony]].

In the 12th century, however, the kingdom contracted to its core, and in 1162 King [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI]] declared himself [[Kingdom of Navarre|king of Navarre]]. Throughout its early history, the Navarrese kingdom engaged in frequent skirmishes with the Carolingian Empire, from which it maintained its independence, a key feature of its history until 1513.

===Kingdom of Aragon (1035–1706)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Aragon|Crown of Aragon}}
[[File:Jaume I, Cantigas de Santa Maria, s.XIII.jpg|thumb|The Moors request permission from [[James I of Aragon]]]]

The Kingdom of Aragon started off as an offshoot of the Kingdom of Navarre. It was formed when [[Sancho III of Navarre]] decided to divide his large realm among all his sons. Aragon was the portion of the realm which passed to [[Ramiro I of Aragon]], an illegitimate son of Sancho III. The kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre were several times united in personal union until the death of [[Alfonso the Battler]] in 1135.

In 1137 the heiress of the kingdom married the [[count of Barcelona]], and their son [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II]] ruled from 1162 the combined possessions of his parents, resulting in what modern historians call the [[Crown of Aragon]].

In the following centuries, the Crown of Aragon conquered a number of territories in the Iberian peninsula and the Mediterranean, including the [[kingdom of Valencia]] and the [[kingdom of Mallorca]]. [[James I of Aragon]], also known as James the Conqueror, expanded his territories to the north, south and east. James also signed the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)]], which released him from the nominal suzerainty of the King of France.

Early in his reign, James attempted to reunite the Aragonese and Navarrese crowns through a treaty with the childless [[Sancho VII of Navarre]]. But the Navarrese nobles rejected him, and chose [[Theobald IV of Champagne]] in his stead.

Later on, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], married [[Isabella of Castile]], leading to a dynastic union which eventually gave birth to modern [[Spain]], after the conquest of Upper [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] (Navarre south of the Pyrenees) and the [[kingdom of Granada]].

===Kingdom of Portugal (1139–1910)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Portugal}}
[[File:GeraldoGeraldesSemPavor.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of [[Gerald the Fearless]]. A Portuguese folk hero with the head of a Moor]]

In 1139, after an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]] against the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], [[Afonso Henriques]] was proclaimed the first [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] by his troops. According to the legend, Christ announced from heaven{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Afonso's great deeds, whereby he would establish the first [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]] and be crowned by the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] [[Archbishop of Braga]]. In the [[Treaty of Zamora]] in 1143, [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile]] recognized Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León.

In 1147, Portugal [[Conquest of Santarém|captured Santarém]], and seven months later the city of [[Lisbon]] was also brought under Portuguese control after the [[Siege of Lisbon]]. By the papal bull [[Manifestis Probatum]], [[Pope Alexander III]] recognized Afonso Henriques as King of Portugal in 1179.

With [[Portugal]] finally recognized as an independent kingdom by its neighbours, [[Afonso Henriques]] and his successors, aided by [[Crusades|Crusaders]] and the military monastic orders the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Order of Aviz]] or the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Saint James]], pushed the [[Moors]] to the [[Algarve]] on the southern coast of Portugal. After several campaigns, the Portuguese part in the ''Reconquista'' came to an end with the definitive capture of the Algarve in 1249. With all of Portugal now under the control of [[Afonso III of Portugal]], religious, cultural and ethnic groups became gradually homogenized.

[[File:OrderOfCristCross.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Cross of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]]]

After the completion of the ''Reconquista'', the Portuguese territory was a Roman Catholic realm. Nonetheless, [[Denis of Portugal]] carried out a short war with [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] for possession of the towns of [[Serpa]] and [[Moura Municipality|Moura]]. After this, Denis avoided war; he signed the Treaty of Alcanizes with [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] in 1297, establishing the present-day borders.

During the suppression of the Knights Templar all over [[Europe]], under the influence of [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Pope Clement V]] requesting its annihilation by 1312, King Denis reinstituted the Templars of [[Tomar]] as the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] in 1319. Denis believed that the Order's assets should by their nature stay in any given Order instead of being taken by the King, largely for the Templars' contribution to the ''Reconquista'' and the reconstruction of Portugal after the wars.

The experience gained during the battles of the ''Reconquista'' was fundamental to [[Conquest of Ceuta]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} the first step to the establishment of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Likewise, the contact with [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim's navigation techniques and sciences]] enabled the creation of [[Portuguese Renaissance|Portuguese nautical innovations]] such as the [[caravel]] – the principal Portuguese ship during their voyages of exploration in the [[Age of Discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobson|first1=John M.|title=The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation|date=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521547246|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQN85hrJyT4C&amp;pg=PA141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Minor Christian realms were the [[Kingdom of Viguera]] (970–1005), and the [[:es:Señorío de Valencia|Principality of Valencia]] (1094–1102).

==Christian infighting==
Clashes and raids on bordering Andalusian lands did not keep the Christian kingdoms from battling among themselves or allying with Muslim kings. Some Muslim kings had Christian-born wives or mothers.  Some Christian champions, like [[El Cid]], were contracted by [[taifa]] kings to fight against their neighbours. Indeed, [[El Cid]]'s first battle experience was gained fighting for a Muslim state against a Christian state. At the [[Battle of Graus]] in 1063, he and other Castilians fought on the side of [[Ahmad al-Muqtadir|al-Muqtadir]], Muslim [[sultan]] of [[Zaragoza]], against the forces of [[Ramiro I of Aragon]]. There is even an instance of a crusade being declared against another Christian king in Iberia.&lt;ref name="JosephCallaghan"&gt;Joseph O'Callaghan (2003). ''Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain'', Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press. p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the disastrous defeat of [[Alfonso VIII]], King of Castile, at [[Battle of Alarcos|Alarcos]], Kings [[Alfonso IX]] of León and [[Sancho VII]] of Navarre entered an alliance with the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] and invaded Castile in 1196. By the end of the year Sancho VII had dropped out of the war under Papal pressure. Early in 1197, at the request of [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], King of Portugal, Pope [[Celestine III]] declared a crusade against Alfonso IX and released his subjects from their responsibilities to the king, declaring that "the men of his realm shall be absolved from their fidelity and his dominion by authority of the apostolic see."&lt;ref name="JosephCallaghan" /&gt; Together the Kings of Portugal, Castile, and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] invaded León. In the face of this onslaught combined with pressure from the Pope, Alfonso IX was finally forced to sue for peace in October 1197.

In the late years of ''Al-Andalus'', Castile had the might to conquer the remnants of the kingdom of [[Granada]], but the kings preferred to claim the tribute of the Muslim ''[[parias]]''. The trade of Granadan goods and the parias were a major means by which African gold entered [[medieval Europe]].

==Christian repopulation of Iberian Peninsula==
{{Further|Medieval demography|Repoblación}}
The ''Reconquista'' was a process not only of war and conquest, but also of [[colonization|repopulation]]. Christian kings moved their own people to locations abandoned by Muslims in order to have a population capable of defending the borders. The main repopulation areas were the [[Douro]] Basin (the northern plateau), the high [[Ebro]] valley ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) and central [[Catalonia]]. The repopulation of the [[Douro]] Basin took place in two distinct phases. North of the river, between the 9th and 10th centuries, the "pressure" (or ''presura'') system was employed. South of the [[Douro]], in the 10th and 11th centuries, the ''presura'' led to the "charters" (''[[foral|forais]]'' or ''[[fueros]]''). ''Fueros'' were used even south of the Central Range.

The ''presura'' referred to a group of peasants who crossed the mountains and settled in the abandoned lands of the Douro Basin. Asturian laws promoted this system, for instance granting a peasant all the land he was able to work and defend as his own property. Of course, Asturian and Galician minor nobles and clergymen sent their own expeditions with the peasants they maintained. This led to very feudalised areas, such as [[León (province)|León]] and Portugal, whereas Castile, an arid land with vast plains and harsh climate, only attracted peasants with no hope in Biscay. As a consequence, Castile was governed by a single count, but had a largely non-feudal territory with many [[wikt:freeman|free]] peasants. ''Presuras'' also appear in Catalonia, when the count of Barcelona ordered the Bishop of Urgell and the count of Gerona to repopulate the plains of [[Vic]].

During the 10th century and onwards, cities and towns gained more importance and power, as commerce reappeared and the population kept growing. ''[[Fuero]]s'' were [[charter]]s documenting the privileges and usages given to all the people repopulating a town. The ''fueros'' provided a means of escape from the [[feudal system]], as ''fueros'' were only granted by the monarch. As a result, the town council was dependent on the monarch alone and, in turn, was required to provide ''auxilium'' – aid or troops – for their monarch. The military force of the towns became the ''caballeros villanos''. The first ''fuero'' was given by count [[Fernán González]] to the inhabitants of [[Castrojeriz]] in the 940's. The most important towns of medieval Iberia had ''fueros'', or ''forais''. In Navarre, ''fueros'' were the main repopulating system. Later on, in the 12th century, Aragon also employed the system; for example, the ''fuero'' of [[Teruel]], which was one of the last fueros, in the early 13th century.

From the mid-13th century on, no more charters were granted, as the demographic pressure had disappeared and other means of re-population were created. ''Fueros'' remained as city charters until the 18th century in Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia and until the 19th century in Castile and Navarre. ''Fueros'' had an immense importance for those living under them, who were prepared to go to war to defend their rights under the charter. In the 19th century, the abolition of the ''fueros'' in Navarre would be one of the causes of the [[Carlist Wars]]. In Castile, disputes over the system contributed to the war against Charles I ([[Castilian War of the Communities]]).

==Muslim decline and defeat==

===Fall of the Caliphate===
[[File:Batalla del Puig por Marzal de Sas (1410-20).jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Puig]] at [[El Puig|El Puig de Santa Maria]] in 1237]]

During the 9th century the Berbers returned to North Africa in the aftermath of revolts. Many governors of large cities distant from the capital, Córdoba, had planned to establish their independence. Then, in 929, the [[Emir of Córdoba]] ([[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]), the leader of the Umayyad dynasty, declared himself [[Caliph]], independent from the [[Abbasid]]s in [[Baghdad]]. He took all the military, religious, and political power and reorganised the army and the bureaucracy.

After regaining control over the dissident governors, Abd-ar-Rahman III tried to conquer the remaining Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, attacking them several times and forcing them back beyond the [[Cantabrian Mountains]]. Abd-ar-Rahman's grandson later became a puppet in the hands of the great [[Vizier]] [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir|Almanzor]] (''al-Mansur'', "the victorious"). Almanzor waged several campaigns attacking and sacking [[Burgos]], León, [[Pamplona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Santiago de Compostela]] before his death in 1002.

Between Almanzor's death and 1031, Al-Andalus suffered many civil wars, which ended in the division into the [[Taifa|Taifa kingdoms]]. The taifas were small kingdoms, established by the city governors. The result was many (up to 34) small kingdoms, each centered upon its capital. Their governors had no larger-scale vision of the Moorish presence in the Iberian peninsula and had no qualms about attacking their neighbouring kingdoms whenever they could gain advantage by doing so.

The split into the taifa states weakened the Islamic presence, and the Christian kingdoms further advanced as [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] conquered [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085. Surrounded by enemies, taifa rulers sent a desperate appeal to the Berber chieftain [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], leader of the Almoravids.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Almoravids===

[[File:Capture de Séville par Ferdinand III.jpg|thumb|Capture of Seville by [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] (painted by [[Francisco Pacheco]])]]
The [[Almoravid]]s were a Muslim militia primarily composed of Berber and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] Moors, and unlike previous Muslim rulers, they were not so tolerant towards Christians and Jews. Their armies entered the Iberian peninsula on several occasions (1086, 1088, 1093) and defeated King Alfonso at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] in 1086, but initially their purpose was to unite all the taifas into a single Almoravid Caliphate. Their actions halted the southward expansion of the Christian kingdoms. Their only defeat came at [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] in 1094, due to the actions of [[El Cid]].

Meanwhile, Navarre lost all importance under King [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]], for he lost Rioja to [[Sancho II of Castile]], and nearly became the vassal of Aragon. At his death, the Navarrese chose as their king [[Sancho Ramírez]], King of Aragon, who thus became Sancho V of Navarre and I of Aragon. Sancho Ramírez gained international recognition for Aragon, uniting it with Navarre and expanding the borders south, conquering ''Wasqa&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[Huesca]] deep in the valleys in 1096 and building a fort, El Castellar, 25&amp;nbsp;km from ''Saraqusta&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[Zaragoza]].

Catalonia came under intense pressure from the taifas of Zaragoza and [[Taifa of Lérida|Lérida]], as well as from internal disputes, as Barcelona suffered a dynastic crisis that led to open war among the smaller counties.  But by the 1080s, the situation had calmed down, and the dominion of Barcelona over the smaller counties was restored.

After a brief period of disintegration (the second [[Taifa]] period), the Almohads, the rising power in North Africa, took over most of ''Al-Andalus''. However they were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212) by a Christian coalition, losing almost all the remaining lands of ''Al-Andalus'' in the following decades. By 1252 only the [[Kingdom of Granada]] remained intact but as a vassal state of Castile.

===Granada War and the end of Muslim rule in Iberia===
{{Main article|Granada War|Treaty of Granada (1491)}}
[[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] completed the ''Reconquista'' with a war against the [[Emirate of Granada]] that started in 1482 and ended with Granada's surrender on January 2, 1492. The Moors in Castile previously numbered "half a million within the realm." By 1492 some 100,000 had died or been enslaved, 200,000 had emigrated, and 200,000 remained in Castile. Many of the Muslim elite, including Granada's former Emir Muhammad XII, who had been given the area of the [[Alpujarras]] mountains as a principality, found life under Christian rule intolerable and emigrated to [[Tlemcen]] in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry. "Spain 1469 – 1714 A Society of Conflict." Third edition. pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1497 Spanish forces took [[Melilla]], west of Oran, and the island of [[Djerba]], south of Tunis, and went on to more important gains, with the bloody [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1509)|seizure of Oran in 1509]], and the capture of [[Bougie]] and [[Spanish conquest of Tripoli (1510)|Tripoli in 1510]]. The Spanish capture of [[Tripoli]] cost them some 300 men, while the inhabitants suffered between 3,000 and 5,000 killed and another 5,000–6,000 carried off as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Last Great Muslim Empires|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, however, they faced competition from the rapidly expanding [[Ottoman Empire]] in the east and were pushed back.

==Conversions and expulsions==
{{Main article|Treaty of Granada (1491)|Alhambra decree|Expulsion of the Moriscos|Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain}}
[[File:Higueruela.jpg|thumb|Forces of [[Muhammed IX, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed IX]], [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] Sultan of [[Granada]], at the [[Battle of La Higueruela]], 1431]]

As elsewhere in the Muslim world, Christians and Jews were allowed to retain their religions, with their own legal systems and courts, by paying a tax, the ''[[jizya]]''. The penalty for not paying it was imprisonment.

The new Christian hierarchy demanded heavy taxes from non-Christians and gave them rights, such as in the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)]] only for Moors in recently Islamic Granada. On July 30, 1492, all the Jewish community – some 200,000 people – were forcibly expelled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/expulsion.html "Modern Jewish History: The Spanish Expulsion (1492)"], ''The Jewish Virtual Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year the [[Alhambra decree]] ordered the expulsion of practicing Jews, leading many to convert to Catholicism. In 1502, Queen Isabella I declared conversion to Catholicism compulsory within the Kingdom of Castile. King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] did the same to Moors in the Kingdom of Aragon in 1526, forcing conversions of its Muslim population during the [[Revolt of the Germanies]].&lt;ref name = "Tofiño"&gt;[http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ciberletras/v06/tofino.html Censorship and Book Production in Spain During the Age of the Incunabula], Ignacio Tofiño-Quesada. Graduate Center, CUNY.&lt;/ref&gt; Many local officials took advantage of the situation to seize property.

=== Spanish Inquisition ===
{{Main article|Spanish Inquisition}}

Most of the descendants of those Muslims who submitted to conversion to Christianity – rather than exile – during the early periods of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, the Moriscos, were later [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled from Spain]] after serious social upheaval, when the Inquisition was at its height. The expulsions were carried out more severely in eastern Spain (Valencia and Aragon) due to local animosity towards Muslims and Moriscos where they were seen as economic rivals by local workers who saw them as cheap labor undermining their bargaining position with the landlords. Exactions imposed on the Moriscos paved the way to a major [[Morisco revolt]] happening in 1568, with the final [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] from [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] taking place in 1609; they were driven from [[Aragon]] at about the same time.

Making things more complex were the many former Muslims and Jews known as ''[[Morisco]]s'', ''[[Marrano]]s'', and ''[[Converso]]s'', who shared ancestors in common with many Christians, especially among the aristocracy, causing much concern over loyalty and attempts by the aristocracy to hide their non-Christian ancestry. Some – the numbers are debated – continued to secretly practice their religions and use their languages well into the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Nevertheless, all those deemed to be "New Christians" were repeatedly suspected of illegally continuing in secret to practice their religions various [[treason|crimes against the Spanish state]] including continued practice of Islam or Judaism. New Christians were subject to many discriminatory practices starting in the sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Classifications and later consequences==
[[File:Pedro Berruguete Saint Dominic Presiding over an Auto-da-fe 1495.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Dominic]] presiding over an ''auto-da-fé'', by [[Pedro Berruguete]] (around 1495)&lt;ref name="Prado"&gt;* [http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/saint-dominic-presides-over-an-auto-da-fe/] at [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The many advances and retreats created several social types:
*The ''[[Muladi]]'': Christians under Islamic rule who converted to Islam after the arrival of the Berbers.
*The ''[[Mozarab]]s'': Christians in Muslim-held lands. Some of them migrated to the north of the peninsula in times of persecution bringing elements of the styles, food and agricultural practices learned from the Andalusians, while they continued practicing their Christianity with older forms of Catholic worship and their own versions of the [[Latin]] language.
*"[[New Christians]]", Jews converting to Christianity called ''[[conversos]]'', or pejoratively ''[[Marrano]]s''. Jews converted to Christianity voluntarily or through force. Some were [[Crypto-Jews]] who continued practicing [[Judaism]] secretly. All remaining Jews were expelled from Spain as a consequence of the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], and from Portugal in 1497. Former Jews, known as ''Conversos'' (''the converted''), were subject to the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s, established to enforce Christian faith and practice, which often resulted in secret investigations and public punishments of ''conversos'' in [[auto-da-fé]]s ("acts of faith"), often public executions by burning the victim alive.
*The ''[[Mudéjar]]'' : Muslims in Christian-held lands.
* ''[[Morisco]]s'': Muslim ''[[converso]]s''. Muslims who were forced to convert to Catholicism. A significant number were Crypto-Muslims who continued practicing Islam secretly. They ranged from successful skilled artisans, valued and protected in Aragon, to impoverished peasants in Castile. After the [[Alhambra Decree]] the entire Islamic population was forced to convert or leave, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century a significant number were expelled in the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]].

==Legacy==
{{See also|History of Spain|History of Portugal|Portugal in the period of discoveries}}

Real, legendary, and fictional episodes from the ''Reconquista'' are the subject of much of medieval [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Spanish literature|Spanish]], and [[Catalan literature]] such as the ''[[cantar de gesta]]''.

Some noble [[genealogy|genealogies]] show the close relations (although not very numerous) between Muslims and Christians. For example, [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]], whose rule is considered to have marked the peak of power for Moorish ''Al-Andalus'' Iberia, married Abda, daughter of [[Sancho II of Navarra|Sancho Garcés II]] of [[Navarra]], who bore him a son, named Abd al-Rahman and commonly known in pejorative sense as [[Sanchuelo]] (''Little Sancho''; in Arabic: ''Shanjoul'').

After his father's death, Sanchuelo/Abd al-Rahman, as a son of a Christian princess, was a strong contender to take over the ultimate power in Muslim al-Andalus. A hundred years later, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile]], considered among the greatest of the Medieval Spanish kings, designated as his heir his son (also a Sancho) by the refugee [[Muslim]] princess [[Zaida of Seville]].

The ''Reconquista'' was a war with long periods of respite between the adversaries, partly for pragmatic reasons and also due to infighting among the Christian kingdoms of the North spanning over seven centuries. Some populations practiced Islam or Christianity as their own religion during these centuries, so the identity of contenders changed over time.

===Festivals in modern Spain===
Currently, festivals called ''[[moros y cristianos]]'' (Castilian), ''moros i cristians'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''mouros e cristãos'' (Portuguese) and ''mouros e cristiáns'' (Galician), which all mean "Moors and Christians", recreate the fights as colorful parades with elaborate garments and lots of fireworks, especially on the central and southern towns of the [[Land of Valencia]], like [[Alcoi]], [[Ontinyent]] or [[Villena]].

=== Persistent effects ===
A 2016 study found that the manner of the Reconquest has persistent effects on the Spanish economy to this day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oto-Peralías|first=Daniel|last2=Romero-Ávila|first2=Diego|date=May 13, 2016|title=The economic consequences of the Spanish Reconquest: the long-term effects of Medieval conquest and colonization|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=409–464|doi=10.1007/s10887-016-9132-9|issn=1381-4338|hdl=10023/10769}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors show how territory quickly re-taken during the Reconquest was given to nobility, whereas territory slowly re-taken was more equally distributed and settled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lands dominated by nobility have worse long-term development outcomes and greater inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Reverberations===

On the conclusion of Iberian victory over the Moors, the Iberian powers, Spain and Portugal didn't stop their warring against the Muslims solely in their homelands—they extended the conflict against Islam overseas. The Spanish under the Hapsburg dynasty soon became the champions of Roman Catholicism in Europe and the Mediterranean against the encroaching threat of the [[Ottoman-Hapsburg Wars|Ottoman Caliphate]]. In a similar vein, the Portuguese also extended the Reconquista, this time against Muslim states overseas. The [[conquest of Ceuta]] marked the beginning of Portuguese expansion into Muslim Africa. Soon, the Portuguese also [[Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts|went into conflict with the Ottoman Caliphate]] in the [[Portuguese expedition to Otranto|Mediterranean]]&lt;ref&gt;proficiscitur Hydruntum classis quam ex Portugallia accersivimus. . .

The '''state of nature''' is a concept used in [[Ethics|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], [[religion]], [[social contract]] theories and international law&lt;ref&gt;[[Emer de Vattel]], ''The Law of Nations'', Preliminaries. Idea and General Principles. §4.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the hypothetical conditions of what the lives of people might have been like before [[Society#Conceptions|societies]] came into existence. Philosophers of the state of nature theory deduce that there must have been a time before [[Society#Conceptions|organized societies]] existed, and this presumption thus raises questions such as: "What was life like before [[civil society]]?"; "How did government first emerge from such a starting position?," and; "What are the hypothetical reasons for entering a state of society by establishing a nation-state?".

In some versions of social contract theory, there are no rights in the state of nature, only freedoms, and it is the contract that creates rights and obligations. In other versions the opposite occurs: the contract imposes restrictions upon individuals that curtail their [[natural rights]].

Societies existing before or without a [[state (polity)|political state]] are currently studied in such fields as [[paleolithic]] [[history]], and the anthropological subfields of [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[social anthropology]], and [[ethnology]], which investigate the social and power-related structures of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and [[uncontacted peoples]] living in [[Tribe|tribal communities]].

== Noted philosophers ==

=== Mozi (墨子)  ===
The early [[Warring States period|Warring States]] philosopher [[Mozi]] was the first thinker in ancient China to develop an ideal state of nature as a premise to defend the need of a single ruler in a state. According to him, on that state each person have their own moral (yi:義). As a result, people were unable to reach agreements and resources were wasted. Since his philosophy promotes the actions that leads to the benefit (li:利) of the state, such natural organization was rejected:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the beginning of human life, when there was yet no law and government, the custom was "everybody according to his moral (yi:義)." Accordingly each man had his own moral, two men had two different morals and ten men had ten different morals -- the more people the more different notions. And everybody approved of his own moral and disapproved the views of others, and so arose mutual disapproval among men. As a result, father and son and elder and younger brothers became enemies and were estranged from each other, since they were unable to reach any agreement. Everybody worked for the disadvantage of the others with water, fire, and poison. Surplus energy was not spent for mutual aid; surplus goods were allowed to rot without sharing; excellent teachings (dao:道) were kept secret and not revealed."

In that way, the ruler of the state and his subjects will have the same morals; cooperation and joint efforts will be the rule. Later his proposal was strongly rejected by [[confucianism]] (especially [[Mencius]]) because of the preference of benefit over morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;dq=a+daoist+theory+of+chinese&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought: A Philosophical Interpretation|last=Hansen|first=Chad|date=2000-08-17|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195350760|location=|pages=158–162|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Hobbes===
The pure state of nature or "the natural condition of mankind" was described by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]], in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and in his earlier work ''[[On the Citizen]]''.&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;Hobbes, Thomas, ''Leviathan''. 1651. Edwin Curley (Ed.) 1994. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes argued that all humans are by nature equal in faculties of body and mind (i.e., no ''natural'' inequalities are so great as to give anyone a "claim" to an exclusive "benefit"). From this equality and other causes {{Examples|date=June 2018}}in human nature, everyone is naturally willing to fight one another: so that "during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called warre; and such a warre as is of every man against every man". In this state every person has a [[natural right]] or liberty to do anything one thinks necessary for preserving one's own life; and life is "solitary, poor, [[nasty, brutish, and short]]" (''Leviathan,'' Chapters XIII–XIV). Hobbes described this natural condition with the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'' (meaning war of all against all), in his work ''[[De Cive]]''.

Within the state of nature there is neither personal property nor injustice since there is no law, except for certain natural precepts discovered by reason ("[[Natural law|laws of nature]]"): the first of which is "that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it" (''Leviathan'', Ch. XIV); and the second is "that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself" (''loc. cit.''). From here Hobbes develops the way out of the state of nature into political society and government, by [[Social Contract|mutual contracts]].

According to Hobbes the state of nature exists at all times among independent countries, over whom there is no law except for those same precepts or laws of nature (''Leviathan'', Chapters XIII, XXX end). His view of the state of nature helped to serve as a basis for theories of international law and relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yurdusev|first1=A. Nuri|title=Thomas Hobbes and international relations: from realism to rationalism|journal=Australian Journal of International Affairs|date=June 2006|volume=60|issue=2|page=305|url=http://www3.dogus.edu.tr/cerdem/images/Political%20Thought/Thomas%20Hobbes%20and%20international%20relations%20from%20realism%20to%20rationalism.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Locke ===
[[John Locke]] considers the state of nature in his ''[[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' written around the time of the [[Exclusion Crisis]] in England during the 1680s. For Locke, in the state of nature all men are free "to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature." (2nd Tr., §4). "The state of Nature has a law of Nature to govern it", and that law is reason. Locke believes that reason teaches that "no one ought to harm another in his life, liberty, and or property" (2nd Tr., §6) ; and that transgressions of this may be punished. Locke describes the state of nature and civil society to be opposites of each other, and the need for civil society comes in part from the perpetual existence of the state of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldwin|first1=Robert|title=Locke's State of Nature in Political Society|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|date=March 1976|volume=29|issue=1|page=126|doi=10.2307/447588|jstor=447588}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of the state of nature is partly deduced from Christian belief (unlike Hobbes, whose philosophy is not dependent upon any prior theology).

Although it may be natural to assume that Locke was responding to Hobbes, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name, and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day, like [[Robert Filmer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Quentin Skinner|Skinner, Quentin]]. ''Visions of Politics''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Locke's First Treatise is entirely a response to Filmer's ''Patriarcha'', and takes a step by step method to refuting Filmer's theory set out in ''Patriarcha''. The conservative party at the time had rallied behind Filmer's ''Patriarcha'', whereas the Whigs, scared of another prosecution of Anglicans and Protestants, rallied behind the theory set out by Locke in his ''Two Treatises of Government'' as it gave a clear theory as to why the people would be justified in overthrowing a monarchy which abuses the trust they had placed in it.{{citation needed|reason=A causal historical claim that needs to be sourced|date=February 2016}}

=== Montesquieu ===
[[Montesquieu]] makes use of the concept of the state of nature in his ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', first printed in 1748. Montesquieu states the thought process behind early human beings before the formation of society. He says that human beings would have the faculty of knowing and would first think to preserve their life in the state. Human beings would also at first feel themselves to be impotent and weak. As a result, humans would not be likely to attack each other in this state. Next, humans would seek nourishment and out of fear, and impulse would eventually unite to create society. Once society was created, a state of war would ensue amongst societies which would have been all created the same way. The purpose of war is the preservation of the society and the self. The formation of law within society is the reflection and application of reason for Montesquieu.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Thomas Nugent, revised by J. V. Prichard. Based on edition published in 1914 by G. Bell &amp; Sons, Ltd., London. Rendered into HTML and text by Jon Roland of the Constitution Society, where the full text of this document may be found, Book 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
Hobbes' view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized people and simply imagining them living outside of the society in which they were raised. He affirmed instead that people were neither good nor bad, but were born as a blank slate, and later society and the environment influence which way we lean. In Rousseau's state of nature, people did not know each other enough to come into serious conflict and they did have normal values. The modern society, and the ownership it entails, is blamed for the disruption of the state of nature which Rousseau sees as true freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''A Discourse on Inequality''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Hume ===
[[David Hume]] offers in ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1739) that human beings are naturally social: "'Tis utterly impossible for men to remain any considerable time in that savage condition, which precedes society; but that his very first state and situation may justly be esteem'd social. This, however, hinders not, but that philosophers may, if they please, extend their reasoning to the suppos'd state of nature; provided they allow it to be a mere philosophical fiction, which never had, and never cou'd have any reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book III, Part II, Section II|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's ideas about human nature expressed in the ''Treatise'' suggest that he would be happy with neither Hobbes' nor his contemporary Rousseau's thought-experiments. He explicitly derides as incredible the hypothetical humanity described in Hobbes' ''Leviathan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book II, Part III, Section I|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he argues in "Of the Origin of Justice and Property" that if mankind were universally benevolent, we would not hold Justice to be a virtue: "’tis only from the selfishness and confin’d generosity of men, along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice derives its origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book III, Part II, Section II|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calhoun===

[[John C. Calhoun]], in his ''Disquisition on Government'', (1850) wrote that a state of nature is merely hypothetical and argues that the concept is self-contradictory and that political states naturally always existed.  "It is, indeed, difficult to explain how an opinion so destitute of all sound reason, ever could have been so extensively entertained, ... I refer to the assertion, that all men are equal in the state of nature; meaning, by a state of nature, a state of individuality, supposed to have existed prior to the social and political state; and in which men lived apart and independent of each other... But such a state is purely hypothetical. It never did, nor can exist; as it is inconsistent with the preservation and perpetuation of the race. It is, therefore, a great misnomer to call it the state of nature. Instead of being the natural state of man, it is, of all conceivable states, the most opposed to his nature—most repugnant to his feelings, and most incompatible with his wants. His natural state is, the social and political—the one for which his Creator made him, and the only one in which he can preserve and perfect his race. As, then, there never was such a state as the, so called, state of nature, and never can be, it follows, that men, instead of being born in it, are born in the social and political state; and of course, instead of being born free and equal, are born subject, not only to parental authority, but to the laws and institutions of the country where born, and under whose protection they draw their first breath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calhoun|first1=John|title=Disquisition on Government|url=http://www.constitution.org/jcc/disq_gov.htm|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|20th century}}
=== John Rawls ===
[[John Rawls]] used what amounted to an artificial state of nature. To develop his [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], Rawls places everyone in the [[original position]]. The original position is a hypothetical state of nature used as a [[thought experiment]]. People in the original position have no society and are under a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] that prevents them from knowing how they may benefit from society. They lack foreknowledge of their intelligence, wealth, or abilities. Rawls reasons that people in the original position would want a society where they had their basic liberties protected and where they had some economic guarantees as well. If society were to be constructed from scratch through a social agreement between individuals, these principles would be the expected basis of such an agreement. Thus, these principles should form the basis of real, modern societies since everyone should consent to them if society were organized from scratch in fair agreements.

=== Robert Nozick ===
Rawls' Harvard colleague [[Robert Nozick]] countered the liberal ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' with the libertarian ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', also grounded in the state of nature tradition.&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=Robert Nozick and the Immaculate Conception of the State |journal= Journal of Libertarian Studies |volume= 1, Num 1. |pages= 45–47 |year=1977 |url= https://mises.org/journals/jls/1_1/1_1_6.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick argued that a minimalist state of property rights and basic law enforcement would develop out of a state of nature without violating anyone's rights or using force. Mutual agreements among individuals rather than social contract would lead to this minimal state.

== Between nations ==
In Hobbes' view, once a civil government is instituted, the state of nature has disappeared between individuals because of the civil power which exists to enforce contracts and the laws of nature generally. Between nations, however, no such power exists and therefore nations have the same rights to preserve themselves—including making war—as individuals possessed. Such a conclusion led some writers to the idea of an association of nations or worldwide [[civil society]]. Among them there were [[Immanuel Kant]] with his work on [[perpetual peace]]. This aim was taken up by former US President [[George H W Bush]] in the drive to create a "New World Order" which he describes as "a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations".

Rawls also examines the state of nature between nations. In his work the ''[[Law of Peoples]]'', Rawls applies a modified version of his original position thought experiment to international relationships. Rawls says that peoples, not states, form the basic unit that should be examined. States should be encouraged to follow the principles from Rawls' earlier ''A Theory of Justice''. [[Democracy]] seems like it would be the most logical means of accomplishing these goals, but benign non-democracies should be seen as acceptable at the international stage. Rawls develops eight principles for how a people should act on an international stage.

{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
'''''The God of the Machine''''' is a book written by [[Isabel Paterson]] and published in 1943 in the [[United States]]. At the time of its release, it was considered a cornerstone to the philosophy of [[individualism]]. Her biographer, [[Stephen D. Cox]], in 2004 described Paterson as the "earliest progenitor of [[libertarianism]] as we know it today".

==Background==
Isabel Paterson wrote a regular column for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', where she first articulated many of her beliefs, which reached their final form in ''The God of the Machine''. She also foreshadowed those ideas, especially free trade, in her historical novels during the 1920s and 1930s.

Paterson opposed most parts of the economic program, known as the [[New Deal]], which US president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[United States Congress|Congress]] put into effect during the 1930s, and she advocated less governmental involvement in social and [[finance|fiscal]] matters. She also led a group of younger friends (many of whom were other employees of the ''Herald Tribune'') who shared her views. One member of that group was the young [[Ayn Rand]].

Paterson and Rand promoted each other's books, and they conducted an extensive exchange of letters, touching on religion and philosophy. That correspondence ended with a personal quarrel in 1948. Rand, an [[atheist]], was critical of the attempts of Paterson, a [[Deism|deist]], to link [[capitalism]] with religion, things that Rand considered incompatible.

'''The Ribbon International''' is a United Nations Non-Governmental Organization that created a large decorated cloth promoting [[nuclear disarmament]] and care and protection of the earth. In an event held on August 4, 1985, panels were connected in an {{convert|18|mi|km}} long strip stretching from [[the Pentagon]] into Washington D.C. The event was covered in the film ''The Ribbon Starts Here'' by [[Nigel Noble]] (1988). Individual sections of the Ribbon are exhibited internationally. In 1991, The Ribbon International became a United Nations Non Governmental Organization.&lt;ref name="The Ribbon International"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Ribbon International | work = UN NGO Directory | publisher = United Nations

[[File:Justines Ribbon.jpg|thumb|Merritt's first Ribbon panel is embroidered with the names of people she loved.]]

The Ribbon International was created in 1982 as a [[Anti-nuclear protests|protest against nuclear war]] by Justine Merritt (1924–2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Merritt | first = Justine | title = Sowing Seeds | url = http://justinemerritt.net/ | accessdate = 2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a trip to the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] in [[Hiroshima]], Japan, in 1975, Merritt conceived the idea of wrapping [[the Pentagon]] with a mile of ribbon to recall (in Merritt's words) "that we love the earth and its people," which is analogous with tying a string around one's finger to remember something.&lt;ref name="Grogan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grogan | first = David | title = A Pentagon Ribbon for Peace | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20091229,00.html | journal = People Magazine | date = July 8, 1985 | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=80}} The event took place on August 4, 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingson | first = Jennifer A. | title = Ring Around the Pentagon: A Nuclear Frieze | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1985/2/8/ring-around-the-pentagon-a-nuclear/ | journal = The Harvard Crimson | date = February 8, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pentagon Ceremony"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pentagon Ceremony Aug. 4 Peace Ribbons in Oklahoma Called In | url = http://newsok.com/pentagon-ceremony-aug.-4-peace-ribbons-in-oklahoma-called-in/article/2115461 | journal = The Oklahoman: NewsOK| date = July 20, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kampel | first = Stewart | title = A 'Ribbon' For Peace Unfurled On L.I. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/nyregion/a-ribbon-for-peace-unfurled-on-li.html | journal = New York Times | date = March 3, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 40th anniversary of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=1}}

The Ribbon was made in the three years leading up to the Pentagon event from hundreds of panels created by local groups co-ordinated nationally by Mary Frances Jaster of Denver with state co-ordinators. Each {{convert|36|by|18|in|cm}} panel used embroidery, quilting, painting and other techniques.  The makers were invited to convey their thoughts and emotions in the panels, with their story on the back.

Friends, relatives, places of worship, and other organizations helped spread Merritt's idea throughout the United States and around the world. Local newsletters and arts and crafts magazines such as ''Fibre Art'', ''Handwoven'', and ''Quilter's Newsletter Magazine'' helped publicize the project.&lt;ref name= "Wilcox"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilcox | first = Don | title = Peace Ribbon Wraps Washington In Largest Collaborative Craft Event In American History | journal = The Craft Report | date = October 1985 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fanning | first = Robbie | title = Fibre Artist Hopes to Wrap Pentagon in Long Embroidered Ribbon That Transforms Ugly Fear Into Concrete Beauty | journal = The Craft Report | date = December 1983 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sew To Speak Is Theme For Ribbon For Peace | journal = Quilters Newsletter Magazine | date = November–December 1984 | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Levin| first=Adam | title= Works From the Heart: Home Sewers Unite To Tie Up the Pentagon | journal=Sews News| volume=June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fanning | first = Robbie | title = After the Ribbon | journal = Threads Magazine | date = December 1985 – January 1986 | pages = 12, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories leading up to the Pentagon event appeared in over 2,500 publications, including local newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kernan | first = Michael | title = Ribbon Around The Pentagon | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138227300.html | journal = Washington Post | date= September 12, 1984 |page = B1 | accessdate=2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boscov | first = Rema | title= Three Years of Peace Work | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138625864.html | journal = Washington Post | date = July 16, 1985 | page = C7 | accessdate=2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hyer | first = Marjorie | title = Prayers for Peace Interwoven | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138619411.html | date = July 27, 1985 | page = G10| accessdate = 2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Where to See Ribbon Segments | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/138595982.html | journal = Washington Post | date = July 27, 1985 | page = G10 | accessdate = 2014-03-08 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weil | first = Martin | title= Police Say 15-Mile Peace Ribbon Won't Tie Up D.C.

[[File:California Banner on Mall.jpg|thumb|Californians contributed over 3,000 panels.]]
Panels were received from contributors in every state in the United States. Every state and many towns and organizations held Ribbon joining events. Panels were received from all over the world, including Russia, England, Germany, New Zealand, Italy, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="The Ribbon Starts Here"&gt;{{cite AV media | title = The Ribbon Starts Here |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FiK79mvYk| accessdate = 2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of women with [[Church Women United]] led a grassroots effort around the country, making panels and assisting with preparations in Washington. Their newsletter, which was sent to a half a million members of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church in America]], the [[Salvation Army]], the [[Quakers]], and 29 other [[Christian denominations]], provided information on how to construct the panels. More than 3,000 Ribbon panels were contributed by this group.&lt;ref name="Pentagon Ceremony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Janzen | first = Victoria | title = Kansans and The Peace Ribbon Around the Pentagon in the 1980s | url = http://archive.bethelks.edu/ml/issue/vol-64/article/kansans-and-the-peace-ribbon-around-the-pentagon-i/ | journal = Mennonite Life | date = Summer 2010 | volume = 64 | accessdate = 2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartman"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biography of Annabel Hartman | url = http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/collection-guides/annabel-hartman-papers-1981-1990.pdf| publisher = Indiana Historical Society | date = March 31, 2003 | accessdate = 2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California delegation contributed over 3,000 panels for the Ribbon event. In 1984, they created a display of panels that surrounded [[Lake Merritt]] in [[Oakland]].{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=93}} The California group also sent panels to Hiroshima for a Ribbon event that was going to surround the at the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]] on the same day as the Pentagon event.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Steele | first = R.

Marie Dennis Grosso, Joan Urbanczyk, and Margaret Schellenberg of the Center for a New Creation (a peace group in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia) coordinated the Washington event. The center concentrated on peacemaking, poverty and economic justice, human rights, and women's issues.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=103}} [[Betty Bumpers]], an advocate for world peace and wife of former U.S. Senator and Governor of Arkansas [[Dale Bumpers]], also worked on preparations for the Washington event with her group Peace Links, a national nonpartisan organization of women who oppose the nuclear arms buildup.{&lt;ref name="Rowley"&gt;{{cite web | last = Rowley | first = James | title = Group Plans To Stretch 'Peace Ribbon' From Pentagon To Capitol Hill | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Group-Plans-To-Stretch-Peace-Ribbon-From-Pentagon-To-Capitol-Hill/id-4ba9b8b731d43f111f107bcc56e9a6a8 | agency = Associated Press | date = August 2, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=149}} Organizers planned a {{convert|10|to|15|mi|km|adj=on}} route through Washington D.C., and met with various police authorities and the [[National Park Service]] to obtain the required permits. Security was of utmost importance; the course from Virginia into Washington travelled past some of the most important buildings and monuments in the country. Forty-nine churches and one senior's center in the Washington area hosted individual state delegations and participants. The churches held a reception for attendees and provided bag lunches, lodging, and transportation. Host churches also displayed panels.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|pp=103–104}}&lt;ref name="Wilcox"/&gt;

== Events in Washington ==
[[File:Washing National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Each of the 2,500 pews in the cathedral was covered with a panel.]]
[[File:The Ribbon Starts Here.jpg|thumb|Assembly of the Ribbon gets underway at the [[United States Capitol]], Washington, D.C.]]
The interfaith service for peace, held on August 3 at the [[Washington National Cathedral]], was attended by 5,000 people. Cathedral staff reported that it was the second-largest crowd ever hosted in the building.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=150}} Over 4,000 panels were on display during the service. Each pew was decorated, and additional Ribbons were draped and tied in various locations around the building. Twenty bagpipers in Highland dress led a procession of 200 people carrying Ribbons into the cathedral. The service also included dancing, meditation, and a performance by the [[Howard University]] Gospel Choir.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ribbon News Letter"&gt;{{cite journal | title= 'Ribbon' Documentary| journal = The Ribbon Newsletter | volume = October 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were in attendance both at the church service and during The Ribbon event the next day.

When all 27,000 individual panels were joined together on August 4, it created a ribbon {{convert|18|mi}} long.&lt;ref name="Weil" /&gt; Don Wilcox of ''The Craft Report'' described it as "the largest collaborative craft event in American history".&lt;ref name="Wilcox"/&gt; The Ribbon wrapped around the Pentagon building, through the Pentagon parking lot, down the foot paths alongside the [[Jefferson Davis Highway]] and [[Washington Boulevard (Arlington)|Washington Boulevard]], crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Washington D.C. at the [[Arlington Memorial Bridge]], and travelled into the [[National Mall]] area. The Ribbon then went past the [[Lincoln Memorial]], along the south side of the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool]], continuing east along the National Mall, and around the U.S.[[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]]. It then turned west along the north side of the National Mall, went around the Ellipse by the White House, passed the Lincoln Memorial, crossed the Potomac River again and returned to the Pentagon. When the chain of panels was completed, hundreds of balloons were released near the Lincoln Memorial. The entire route was lined with people, and crowds gathered at the three designated speaking areas (the Pentagon, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Capitol). Singers, including [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Tom Chapin]], rotated between the three stage areas, performing anti-war songs.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sanders | first = Steve | title = 'Peace Ribbon' Tied Around The Capitol | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-08-05/news/8502200974_1_chicago-peace-museum-justine-merritt-lincoln-memorial | journal = Chicago Tribune | date = August 5, 1985 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=154}} Newspapers estimated a total attendance of 30,000 to 100,000 people.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Video filming was done by numerous individuals, and professional television video personnel from New York and Washington, D.C., who donated their time and equipment to create a documentary about the event. The documentary film ''The Ribbon Starts Here'',&lt;ref name="The Ribbon Starts Here"/&gt; was produced by Academy Award-winning film maker [[Nigel Noble]], and directed by Nigel Noble and Hilary Raff Lindsay; Nobel Enterprises. The video was released in 1988.&lt;ref name="Wilcox"/&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=292}}

== Subsequent events ==
After August 4, state coordinators returned home with their Ribbon panels, which were then displayed in libraries, schools, and museums, and used in parades and events.&lt;ref name="Weil"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weil | first = Dorothy | title = Peace Packages Around The Pentagon | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wh8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=picture+#v=onepage&amp;q=picture&amp;f=false | journal = Cincinnati Magazine | date = November 1986 | pages = 155–157 | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p={{page needed|date=June 2014}} }} Historical societies and universities now house historical information about the Ribbon and archival collections of panels.&lt;ref name="Hartman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Peace Ribbon Project Northwest Ohio | url = http://www2.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/cac/ms/page45281.html |publisher = Center for Archival Collections, Bowling Green State University | accessdate = 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Ribbons and panels were selected as gallery pieces, and are on display in [[The Peace Museum]] in Chicago.

The Ribbon evolved into The Ribbon International in the late 1980s, and became a United Nations Non Governmental Organization in 1991.&lt;ref name="The Ribbon International"/&gt; Ribbon events can be held for special designated days such as the [[International Day of Peace]] (September 21), [[Earth Day]] (April 21), special prayer days or other events. Any individual or group can create a panel for a Ribbon, start a Ribbon in their community, or give a panel as a gift to someone who is engaged in promoting peace, environmental causes, or disarmament.&lt;ref name="Peppers 14"/&gt;

New panels continue to be created for display at various environmental and peace events. Ribbons have been given to the [[New York City Council]], Russian President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], and [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Palmer | first = Susan | title = Peace Winds Like a Ribbon |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/registerguard/doc/377698479.html | journal = Eugene Register-Guard | date = May 14, 2005 |page = D1 | accessdate = 2014-02-25 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panels from the Ribbon were displayed at the [[United Nations Decade for Women]] international conference in [[Nairobi]] in 1985, and others were used by members of Women for a Meaningful Summit at their demonstration at the [[Geneva Summit (1985)]]. Ribbons were used at peace demonstrations at the [[Nevada Nuclear Test Site]], and the Horse Creek Missile Silo near [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and the [[Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament]] in 1986.{{sfn|Pershing|1996|p=264}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83636">This article details the chronology of events in the [[2007 Burmese anti-government protests]].

==Timeline==

===Prologue===
Prior to the summer protests, there had been growing unease in the population regarding the economic distress of the country which has stagnant economic growth and is ranked among the 20 poorest countries in the world according to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Michael Casey, [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iofx72HB6-rwZnXsnhgbYbIpkVFQ Monks Put Myanmar Junta in Tight Spot], Associated Press, September 21, 2007.{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, including the United Nations have blamed the economic problems on the inept leadership of the military junta that spends large amount of money  maintaining one of the world's largest armies (said to total more than half the country's annual budget).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7023548.stm/ The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest] BBC, 02/10/07&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2006, the cost of basic commodities began rising sharply in Burma with rice, eggs, and cooking oil increasing by 30-40%.  According to the UN, one in three children is chronically malnourished, government spending on health and education is among the lowest anywhere in the world, and the average income is below $300 a year.  Living a privileged, parallel existence, Burma's military forces appear virtually a "state within a state", subject to none of the severe economic insecurity that afflicts the rest of the country. Many of the high ranking army generals have become immensely rich; as witnessed in the video of the wedding of senior general [[Than Shwe]]'s daughter, who is shown wearing diamonds worth many millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7023548.stm The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest] ''BBC News'' October 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6109356.stm Burma leader's lavish lifestyle aired] BBC, 02/11/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the BBC, on February 22, 2007, a small group of individuals protested the current state of consumer prices in the country. While the protest was small and careful not to be seen as directed at the military junta, officials jailed nine of the protesters. it was the first street protest seen in Rangoon for at least a decade.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===August 15 - Removal of fuel subsidies===
On August 15, 2007 the government removed subsidies on fuel causing a rapid and unannounced increase in prices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The government, which has a monopoly on fuel sales, raised prices of fuel from about $1.40 to $2.80 a gallon, and boosted the price of natural gas by about 500%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; This increase in fuel prices led to an increase in food prices. Soon afterwards, protesters took to the streets to protest the current conditions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

While the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] had been recommending the lifting of subsidies for some time to allow for a [[free market]] to determine fuel prices,&lt;ref name ="IMF"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IH24Ae03.html Fuel price policy explodes in Myanmar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071008153246/http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=688&amp;language_id=1 The Economic Factors Behind the Myanmar Protests]&lt;/ref&gt; these organizations did not recommend removing all of the subsidies unannounced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The fuel is sold by [[Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise]], a [[state monopoly|state-owned]] fuel company.

===Initial demonstrations===
In response to the increase in fuel prices, citizens protested in demonstrations beginning on August 15.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In response to the protests, the government began arresting and beating demonstrators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The government arrested 13 prominent Burmese dissidents including [[Min Ko Naing]], [[Ko Ko Gyi]], [[Min Zeya]], [[Ko Jimmy]], [[Pyone Cho]], [[Arnt Bwe Kyaw]] and [[Mya Aye (activist)|Ko Mya Aye]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Glenn Kessler, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/22/AR2007082202488_pf.html U.S. Condemns Burmese Arrests Of 13 Dissidents: Sharp Increases in Prices Spur Protests] Washington Post, August 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The government newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported that these individuals' actions caused civil unrest that "was aimed at undermining peace and security of the State and disrupting the ongoing National Convention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The United States condemned the arrest of these dissidents on August 22 with the State Department's acting spokesman stating "The United States calls for the immediate release of these activists and for an end of the regime's blatant attempt to intimidate and silence those who are engaged in peaceful promotion of democracy and human rights in Burma...We call on the regime to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the leaders of Burma's democracy movement and ethnic minority groups and to make tangible steps toward a transition to civilian democratic rule."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

On September 5, 2007, Burmese troops forcibly broke up a peaceful demonstration in [[Pakokku]] and injured three monks. The next day, other monks later took government officials as hostages in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7010202.stm Q&amp;A: Protests in Burma] BBC, September 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They demanded an apology by the deadline of September 17, but the military refused to apologize. This sparked protests involving increasing numbers of monks in conjunction with the withdrawal of religious services for the military. Their role in the protests has been significant due to the reverence paid to them by the civilian population and the military.

On September 27, the junta security forces began raiding monasteries across the country to quell the protests, arresting at least 200 monks in Yangon and 500 more in the northeast. There are reports that security forces raided at least five Buddhist monasteries including Ngwe Kya Yan in #3 Block 13th Street, South Okklapah Township and arrested over 200 monks. Security forces broke the wall of Ngwe Kya Yan monastery in a raid at about 0:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. (local time) Thursday morning. Several monks were injured during a clash between the security forces and the monks. "Bleeding monks were forced into a vehicle. They couldn't cover themselves," a local resident told [[Mizzima]]. During the two-hour raid last night, monks rang the alarm bell and screamed for help. As the army has announced it would shoot anybody breaking the curfew, civilians did not dare to come to the aid of monks. Simultaneously, the army raided four other monasteries in parts of Yangon and arrested several monks. Sources confirmed that the army had raided the six storied Religious Science Monastery in Chaukhtatgyi Pagoda, Moe Kaung Monastery in Yan Kin township, Maggin Monastery in Thingankyun township, and Thein Phyu monastery in Thein Phyu area and arrested several monks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mizzima.com/MizzimaNews/News/2007/Sep/Today-demonstration.html Burmese junta raids monasteries, arrests over 200 monks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223100615/http://www.mizzima.com/MizzimaNews/News/2007/Sep/today-demonstration.html |date=2008-02-23 }} Mizzima News, September 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Raids"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar junta raids monasteries, arrests hundreds of monks |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2007-09-26 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070926.wjuntaraids0927/BNStory/International |accessdate=2007-09-27 |location=Toronto }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters Raids"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reuters |title=Myanmar junta raids monasteries |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-27 |url=http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2007-09-27T021914Z_01_B588599_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-MYANMAR-COL.XML |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky News Raids"&gt;{{cite news|title=Monks arrested in monastery raids|publisher=SKY News|date=2007-09-27|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1285944,00.html|accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous diplomat also said the junta claimed soldiers now had the monks "under control" and "would now turn their attention to civilian protesters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/headlines/sep28a.php Junta Declares No-go Zones at Buddhist Monasteries]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Irrawaddy, September 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Myanmar government attempted to dampen public awareness and communications around the protests by cutting Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/burma-cuts-web-access/2007/09/28/1190486554032.html|title= Burma cuts web access | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Troops specifically targeted those caught carrying cameras and beat them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=8787|title=Two Shot in Clash with Troops; People with Cameras Singled Out The Irrawaddy Sept 28 2007|access-date=2009-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116020136/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=8787|archive-date=2009-01-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, after the killing of Japanese photographer [[Kenji Nagai]] by the junta, Japanese [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Yasuo Fukuda]] said he regretted the killing and demanded a full explanation of his death.

There are reports that [[Myanmar Army|Burmese troops]] from middle Myanmar started to march towards Yangon. The troops were from the Central Command based in [[Taungoo]] and the South East Command. It was not clear if the troops were marching to reinforce or to challenge the troops in Yangon for shooting the Buddhist monks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mizzima.com/MizzimaNews/News/2007/Sep/Demon-28-Sep-%202007.html Troops marching to Rangoon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031011728/http://www.mizzima.com/MizzimaNews/News/2007/Sep/Demon-28-Sep-%202007.html |date=2007-10-31 }} Mizzima News, September 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report warned that the military will attempt "to trick UN envoys by asking their followers to carry out a set-up protest - protesting against the genuine demonstrations. SPDC followers will force the civilians to join in also." The same source states compulsory attendance of one person per family in some parts of the town is being demanded. In view of the Internet blackout, a group of "88-generation activists" are now urging the United Nations, along with the United States and United Kingdom embassies in Yangon to open a one-page [[World Wide Web|Web]] service via [[Wi-Fi]] access to the general public just to submit news photos. The blog site confirms from different sources that soldiers and police were officially ordered not to shoot at the crowd.

It has also been reported that the UN envoys will be meeting Lieutenant Senior General Maung Aye, the second chief of the junta.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burmamyanmargenocide.blogspot.com/|title=Burma-Myanmar Genocide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC has reported that several hundred people gathered in Yangon and that eyewitness reports said demonstrators were surrounded by security forces and pro-military vigilante groups. United Nations Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari has arrived in Yangon and was due to fly immediately to [[Naypyidaw]] to talk with the junta generals. Eyewitnesses have told the BBC that over 1,000 people were demonstrating against the government. There have been fresh reports of new violence; the French news agency AFP stated that security forces charged a group of around 100 protesters on the Pansoedan bridge in central Yangon.

Approximately 5,000 people gathered to demonstrate in Mandalay. The military is reported to have locked up and put most monasteries under guard to prevent egress. People gathered at 80th, 84th, 35th, and 33rd Streets, before joining together; three military trucks followed behind them and tried to break up the demonstrators, arresting one student who attempted to cross the road in front of them. The military forced monks from outside Mandalay to return to their native towns, the military are keeping the homes of NLD Party leaders under guard. Peaceful demonstrations were reported in Mandalay, no shooting was reported. The Ngwe Kyar Yan Monastery in South Okkalarpa which was subject to a raid some days ago is now being repaired, some believe, in an effort to eliminate evidence. A dedicated group of anti-riot troops is reported to have been formed within Brigate-77 led by Col. Thein Han under Minister Aung Thaung and General [[Htay Oo]]'s supervision.

'''Totalitarianism''' is a political concept of a mode of government which prohibits opposition parties, restricts individual opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high degree of control over public and private life. It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of [[authoritarianism]]. [[Political power]] in totalitarian states has often been held by [[Dictatorship|rule by one leader]] which employ all-encompassing [[propaganda]] campaigns broadcast by state-controlled [[mass media]]. Totalitarian regimes and are often marked by [[political repression]], [[personality cultism]], [[Command economy|control over the economy]], [[censorship|restriction of speech]], [[mass surveillance]] and widespread use of [[state terrorism]]. Historian Robert Conquest describes a "totalitarian" state as one recognizing no limits to its authority in any sphere of public or private life and which extends that authority to whatever length feasible.&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first developed in the 1920s by both [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] jurist (and later [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] academic) [[Carl Schmitt]] and, concurrently, by the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]]. Italian fascist [[Benito Mussolini]] said "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state". Schmitt used the term ''Totalstaat'' in his influential 1927 work on the legal basis of an all-powerful state, ''[[The Concept of the Political]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Schmitt|date=1927|title=The Concept of the Political (German: Der Begriff des Politischen)|isbn=0-226-73886-8|edition=1996 University of Chicago Press|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the concept was used extensively to [[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism|compare Nazism and Stalinism]].  The Economist has described [[China]]'s recently developed [[Social Credit System|social credit system]] to screen and rank its citizens based on their personal behavior as "totalitarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/12/17/china-invents-the-digital-totalitarian-state |title=China invents the digital totalitarian state |last= |date=17 December 2017 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4|title=China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system — here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/china-experiments-with-sweeping-social-credit-system/a-42030727|title=China experiments with sweeping Social Credit System |date=4 January 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian regimes are different from other [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian ones]]. The latter denotes a state in which the single power holder – an individual "[[dictator]]", a committee or a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] or an otherwise small group of political elite – monopolizes political power. "[The] authoritarian state [...] is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarianism "does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; In contrast, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life, including the economy, education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens. Some totalitarian governments may promote an elaborate ideology: "The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens".&lt;ref name="regime"/&gt; It also mobilizes the whole population in pursuit of its goals. [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of [...] industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

==Early concepts and use==
The notion of totalitarianism as a "total" political power by the state was formulated in 1923 by [[Giovanni Amendola]], who described [[Italian Fascism]] as a system fundamentally different from conventional [[dictatorship]]s.&lt;ref name="regime"&gt;* {{citation| author =Richard Pipes | author-link =Richard Pipes | publication-date = | year =1995 | title = Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime | place =New York | publisher =Vintage Books, Random House Inc. | isbn =0394502426 | page =243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later assigned a positive meaning in the writings of [[Giovanni Gentile]], Italy’s most prominent philosopher and leading theorist of [[fascism]]. He used the term ''totalitario'' to refer to the structure and goals of the new state, which were to provide the "total representation of the nation and total guidance of national goals".&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G., ''Fascism: Comparison and Definition'' (UW Press, 1980), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He described totalitarianism as a society in which the ideology of the state had influence, if not power, over most of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Giovanni and Benito Mussolini in "La dottrina del fascismo" (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benito Mussolini]], this system politicizes everything spiritual and human: "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state".&lt;ref name="regime"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'' (Oxford University Press, 1990) {{ISBN|0-19-507132-8}}, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first to use the term "totalitarianism" in the English language was the Austrian writer [[Franz Borkenau]] in his 1938 book ''The Communist International'', in which he commented that it united the Soviet and German dictatorships more than it divided them.&lt;ref&gt;Nemoianu, Virgil, "Review of ''End and Beginnings''" pp. 1235–38 from MLN, Volume 97, Issue #5, December 1982, p.1235.&lt;/ref&gt; The label "totalitarian" was twice affixed to the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]] during [[Winston Churchill]]'s speech of October 5, 1938&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/the-munich-agreement Speech to the House of Commons, October 5, 1938]: "We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries, have a perfect right to exalt the principle of self-determination, but it comes ill out of the mouths of those in totalitarian states who deny even the smallest element of toleration to every section and creed within their bounds."

"Many of those countries, in fear of the rise of the Nazi power, ... loathed the idea of having this arbitrary rule of the totalitarian system thrust upon them, and hoped that a stand would be made."&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in opposition to the [[Munich Agreement]], by which France and Great Britain consented to [[Nazi Germany]]'s annexation of the [[Sudetenland]]. Churchill was then a [[backbencher]] MP representing the [[Epping (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping constituency]]. In a radio address two weeks later, Churchill again employed the term, this time applying the concept to "a Communist or a Nazi tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/the-defence-of-freedom-and-peace Radio Broadcast to the United States and to London, October 16, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the historic Spanish [[reactionary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |date=2004 |title=Fascists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTE7ytbtp_cC |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=331 |isbn=9780521831314 |author-link=Michael_Mann_(sociologist) }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservatism|conservative]] party called the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] declared his intention to "give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity" and went on to say: "[[Democracy]] is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either [[Cortes Generales|parliament]] submits or we will eliminate it".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Preston. ''The Spanish Civil War: reaction, revolution and revenge''. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York: Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 pp. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] made frequent use of the word totalitarian and its cognates in multiple essays published in 1940, 1941 and 1942. In his essay ''[[Why I Write]]'', he wrote: "The [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish war]] and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for [[democratic socialism]], as I understand it".&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300011h.html#part47 "Why I Write"], Gangrel (Summer) 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'' (published as a book in 1946), the pro-Soviet British historian [[E. H. Carr]] claimed: "The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable" and that [[Marxism–Leninism]] was by far the most successful type of totalitarianism as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the [[Red Army]]'s role in defeating Germany. Only the "blind and incurable" could ignore the trend towards totalitarianism, said Carr.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution'', New York: Scribner, 1987, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' (1961), [[Karl Popper]] articulated an influential critique of totalitarianism: in both works, he contrasted the "open society" of [[liberal democracy]] with totalitarianism and argued that the latter is grounded in the belief that history moves toward an immutable future in accordance with knowable laws.

In ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] argued that [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Communism|Communist]] regimes were new forms of government and not merely updated versions of the old [[tyrannies]]. According to Arendt, the source of the mass appeal of totalitarian regimes is their [[ideology]], which provides a comforting, single answer to the mysteries of the past, present and future. For Nazism, all history is the history of [[race struggle]] and for [[Marxism]] all history is the history of [[class struggle]]. Once that premise is accepted, all actions of the state can be justified by [[appeal to nature]] or the [[Historicism|law of history]], justifying their establishment of authoritarian state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Richard Villa (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hannah Arendt''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|0-521-64571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Arendt, many scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds and ideological positions have closely examined totalitarianism. Among the most noted commentators on totalitarianism are [[Raymond Aron]], Lawrence Aronsen, Franz Borkenau, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Robert Conquest]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], Eckhard Jesse, [[Leopold Labedz]], [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Juan Linz]], [[Richard Löwenthal]], Karl Popper, [[Richard Pipes]], [[Leonard Schapiro]] and [[Adam Ulam]]. Each one of these describes totalitarianism in slightly different ways, but they all agree that totalitarianism seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an official state ideology and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the state, entailing repression or state control of [[business]], [[labour union]]s, [[non-profit organizations]], religious organizations and buildings and [[political party|political parties]].

==Cold War anti-totalitarianism&lt;!--'Anti-totalitarianism', 'Antitotalitarianism', 'Anti-totalitarian', and 'Anti-totalitarian' redirect here--&gt;==
The concept became prominent in [[Western world|Western]] [[anti-communist]] political discourse during the [[Cold War]] era as a tool to convert pre-war [[anti-fascism]] into postwar anti-communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Brook|last=Defty|date=2007|title=Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda 1945–1953|publisher=The Information Research Department|others=Chapters 2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Achim Siegel, ''The totalitarian paradigm after the end of Communism: towards a theoretical reassessment'', 1998, p. 200 "Concepts of totalitarianism became most widespread at the height of the Cold War. Since the late 1940s, especially since the Korean War, they were condensed into a far-reaching, even hegemonic, ideology, by which the political elites of the Western world tried to explain and even to justify the Cold War constellation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Guilhot, ''The democracy makers: human rights and international order'', 2005, p. 33 "The opposition between the West and Soviet totalitarianism was often presented as an opposition both moral and epistemological between truth and falsehood. The democratic, social, and economic credentials of the Soviet Union were typically seen as "lies" and as the product of a deliberate and multiform propaganda...In this context, the concept of totalitarianism was itself an asset. As it made possible the conversion of prewar anti-fascism into postwar anti-communism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Caute, ''Politics and the novel during the Cold War'', 2009, pp. 95–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George A Reisch, ''How the Cold War transformed philosophy of science: to the icy slopes of logic'', 2005, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientists [[Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] were primarily responsible for expanding the usage of the term in university social science and professional research, reformulating it as a paradigm for the [[Soviet Union]] as well as [[fascist]] regimes. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that a totalitarian system has the following six, mutually supportive, defining characteristics:
# Elaborate guiding [[ideology]].
# [[one-party state|Single mass party]], typically led by a [[dictator]].
# [[state terrorism|System of terror]], using such instruments as violence and [[secret police]].
# Monopoly on weapons.
# Monopoly on the [[Mass media|means of communication]].
# Central direction and control of the economy through [[state planning]].

Totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]] and allowed totalitarian movements to seize control of the government while the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled them to effectively establish what Friedrich and Brzezinski called a "totalitarian dictatorship". Some [[Social science|social scientists]] have criticized Friedrich and Brzezinski's '''anti-totalitarian'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; approach, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 186–89, 233–34&lt;/ref&gt; These critics pointed to evidence of popular support for the regime and widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt, but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.

The German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the "totalitarian typology" as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model and failed to consider the "revolutionary dynamic" that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian "closed" understanding of politics from the "open" democratic understanding.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"/&gt; Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition, Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter'' The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The True Believer]]'', [[Eric Hoffer]] argues that mass movements like [[Stalinism]], [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]] had a common trait in picturing Western democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people "too soft, too [[Hedonism|pleasure-loving]] and too [[selfish]]" to [[sacrifice]] for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and "fact-proof screens from reality" are established.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), {{ISBN|0-06-050591-5}}, pp. 61, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later research==
In the 1990s, [[François Furet]] used the term "[[totalitarian twins]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Furet, borrowing from [[Hannah Arendt]], describes [[Bolshevik]]s and [[Nazism|Nazis]] as totalitarian twins, conflicting yet united." [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19950417/singer Singer, Daniel, ''The Nation'' (April 17, 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; to link [[Stalinism]]&lt;ref&gt;"The totalitarian nature of Stalin's Russia is undeniable." [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19991213/singer/3 Singer, Singer,''The Nation'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The government of [[Nazi Germany]] was a fascist, totalitarian state." [http://www.remember.org/guide/Facts.root.nazi.html Grobman, Gary M.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Hobsbawm]] criticized Furet for his temptation to stress a common ground between two systems of different ideological roots.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Hobsbawm (2012), ''Revolutionaries''. Abacus, Ch. 7. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of Soviet history, the totalitarian concept has been disparaged by the [[historical revisionism|revisionist]] school, some of whose more prominent members were [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], [[Jerry F. Hough]], William McCagg, [[Robert W. Thurston]] and [[J. Arch Getty]].&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227"&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225–27&lt;/ref&gt; Though their individual interpretations differ, the revisionists have argued that the Soviet state under [[Joseph Stalin]] was institutionally weak, that the level of terror was much exaggerated and that—to the extent it occurred—it reflected the weaknesses rather than the strengths of the Soviet state.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227"/&gt; Fitzpatrick argued that the Stalin's purges in the Soviet Union provided an increased social mobility and therefore a chance for a better life.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225, 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Sheila, ''Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1987, [[Walter Laqueur]] said that the revisionists in the field of Soviet history were guilty of confusing popularity with morality and of making highly embarrassing and not very convincing arguments against the concept of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian state.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 228"&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur argued that the revisionists' arguments with regard to Soviet history were highly similar to the arguments made by [[Ernst Nolte]] regarding German history.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 228"/&gt; Laqueur asserted that concepts such as modernization were inadequate tools for explaining Soviet history while totalitarianism was not.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laqueur's argument has been criticized by modern revisionist historians, such as [[Paul Buhle]], who claim that Laqueur wrongly equates Cold-war revisionism with the German revisionism. The latter reflected a "revanchist, military-minded conservative nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Buhle and Edward Francis Rice-Maximin (1995), ''William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire''. Psychology Press, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Enzo Traverso]] has attacked the creators of the concept of totalitarianism, who invented it to designate the enemies of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Enzo Traverso (2001), ''Le Totalitarisme: Le XXe siècle en débat''. Poche. {{ISBN|978-2020378574}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Domenico Losurdo]], totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]], and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[USSR]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research. Other scholars, such as [[F. William Engdahl]], [[Sheldon Wolin]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]], have linked totalitarianism to capitalism and liberalism and used concepts, such as [[totalitarian democracy]], [[inverted totalitarianism]] or [[totalitarian capitalism]].

In the 2010s, Vladimir Tismaneanu, Richard Shorten and Aviezer Tucker argued that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems, but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism and/or political violence. They think that both Nazism and Soviet Communism emphasised the role of specialisation in modern societies and saw [[polymathy]] as "a thing of the past"; both claimed to have statistical scientific support for their claims, which led to a strict "ethical" control of culture, psychological violence and persecution of entire groups.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten "Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present", Palgrave, 2012; Vladimir Tismaneanu, “The Devil in History: Communism, Fascism, and Some Lessons of the Twentieth Century”, University of California Press, 2012; Aviezer Tucker "The Legacies of Totalitarianism: A Theoretical Framework", Cambridge University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Their arguments have been criticised by other scholars due to their partiality and anachronism. For instance, Juan Francisco Fuentes treats totalitarianism as an “[[invented tradition]]” and the use of notion of “modern [[despotism]]” as a “reverse anachronism”. For Fuentes, “the anachronistic use of totalitarian/totalitarianism involves the will to reshape the past in the image and likeness of the present.”&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco Fuentes, “How Words reshape the Past: The ‘Old, Old Story’ of Totalitarianism”, Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalitarianism in architecture==
{{main|Totalitarian architecture}}
Non-political aspects of the culture and motifs of totalitarian countries have themselves often been labeled innately "totalitarian". For example, [[Theodore Dalrymple]], a British author, physician and political commentator, has written for ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'' that [[Brutalism|brutalist structures]] are an expression of totalitarianism given that their grand, concrete-based design involves destroying gentler, more-human places such as [[gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian|date=Autumn 2009|author=[[Theodore Dalrymple]]|publisher=''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, author [[George Orwell]] described the [[Ministry of Truth]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as an "enormous, pyramidal structure of white concrete, soaring up terrace after terrace, three hundred metres into the air". [[Columnist]] [[Ben Macintyre]] of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that it was "a prescient description of the sort of totalitarian architecture that would soon dominate the Communist bloc".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|title=Look on those monuments to megalomania, and despair|date=March 30, 2007|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=[[Ben Macintyre]]|accessdate=January 5, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829160102/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|archivedate=August 29, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of totalitarianism in architecture is the [[Panopticon]], a type of institutional building designed by English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late eighteenth century. The concept of the design is to allow a watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without their being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. It was invoked by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' as metaphor for "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11534">'''Transformative social change''' is a philosophical, practical and strategic process to affect revolutionary change within society, i.e., [[social transformation]]. It is effectively a [[systems approach]] applied to broad-based [[social change]] and [[social justice]] efforts to catalyze sociocultural, socioeconomic and political [[revolution]]. In seeking to integrate and then politicize [[personal development]] and [[social development]] as an overarching approach to social change at multiple levels, addressing a wide range of issues, using holistic, nonviolent methods,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/a/deepchangegathering.org/home/ Deep Change Gathering: ''Transforming the Practice of Social Justice'', Gathering, [[Asheville]], NC, June 5–7, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; it may be best classified as a [[new social movement]]. Rather than focus on particular issue(s), it seeks to impact the culture of left of center social movement and organizing work. However, by considering the dismantling of and liberation from oppressive systems, including economic, as core to its goal, it defies even definitions put forth for new social movements. As a comprehensive approach to progressive social change, it seeks distinguishes to itself from the "ordinary" change of conventional social change, social justice and their respective organizing practices by placing emphasis on personal, organizational and social systemic change that cannot be undone, or "deep change".

==Definitions and components==
A key premise defining transformative social change is that "the ends of justice can never be served by the means of injustice, even when the injustice is as subtle as the mental framework instilled by the quest for liberation.("Change vs. Transformation" by [[Angel Kyodo Williams]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Williams| first =Angel Kyodo| authorlink =Angel Kyodo Williams|author2=Gass, Robert |author3=Horwitz, Claudia |author4=Vega-Frey, Jesse |author5=Maina, Ng'ethe |author6=Haines, Staci K. |author7= Movement Strategy Center | title =Framing Deep Change: Essays on Transformative Social Change| publisher =Third Way Press| year =2010| location =| pages =4| url =http://issuu.com/xsochange/docs/framingdeepchange| doi =| id = | isbn = 978-0-9828845-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams further proposes that "because suffering cannot be alleviated by instigating suffering"; the conditions under which social justice activists and seekers operate within organizationally need to exemplify the conditions they wish to ultimately see cultivated within society at large. This ideal coincides with the quote often attributed to but not said by [[Gandhi]], "You must be the change you wish to see in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Mahatma Gandhi|"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi" Wikiquote]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion/falser-words-were-never-spoken.html|title=''Falser Words Were Never Spoken''
|first= Brian|last=Morton |date=August 29, 2011 |work=NY Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to better define and cohere the emerging and evolving work of transformative social change, a People's Movement Assembly process was held at the 2010 [[US Social Forum]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan, in which the following framework for defining transformation was agreed to by way of resolution:

~Transformation, as applied to social change, is a process through which who we are – individually or collectively – is changed so deeply that the following are altered:
* identity (way of seeing/thinking/reflecting upon ourselves and environment),
* emotions (range of feelings and reactivity,)
* embodiment (relationship and connectedness to and within our bodies and how we show up,)
* actions (behaviors, patterned responses,)
* creativity (capacity for responsiveness and ability to access resources,) and
* paradigms (overall perspective and mode of operating.)

Further, the work of transformation requires the following components:
* Awareness of the default conditioning, habits and reactions in our individual, organizational and movement experience.
* Appreciation of old identities and states as they pass away and an understanding of the experience of crisis, breakdown, “undone-ness,” or “not-knowing” as a necessary catalyst that moves us toward new identities and states. People and entities can and must be supported in these periods.
*  A container at the individual, organizational and movement levels; practices that support the process, and a commitment to mentoring people into the necessary skills and processes.
* A sustainable relationship with the whole web of life.

~ Transformation can and does consist of multi-disciplinary practices, modalities and paths, but overall it points toward the centrality of consistent, rigorous practice capable of undoing conditioning. Such a practice must effect systemic changes, internal and external. We refer to the broad spectrum of varied modalities as transformative practices.

~ Transformation happens in its own time and it can’t be undone. We expect processes of transformation, as distinct from change, to be inclined towards being irreversible.

~ In the transformation process, one identity or self passes away and a new, radically altered one emerges. The new way of being is more integrated, resourceful and aligned. This is apparent to others in your presence, your actions and your increased capacity to respond based on vision, rather than reaction. This process repeats itself and deepens through continued engagement in transformative practices and processes. The old, previous “form” sheds again and new emerges again.

~ The methods and philosophy of transformation must be rooted in an explicit analysis of oppression.
&lt;br /&gt;
~ We recognize that this work is grounded in ancient wisdom, lineages and history, and that it is entering a new phase of coherence that allows us to move forward.

==Outcomes of sought==
Applied transformation leads to the following outcomes:
* Radically increased awareness, clarity and comfort with direct experience what is so.
* Breakthroughs in ways of knowing, thinking and accessing creativity
* Impacts our{{Who|date=May 2016}} character in a way that is observable, felt and experienced by others.
* Increased ability to respond from a place of vision and compassion rather than ego or self-interest.
* Increased capacity for, skillfulness with and practice of: presence, authenticity and interdependence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pma2010.org/node/237 ''Defining Transformation for Social Change''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720200008/http://pma2010.org/node/237 |date=2010-07-20 }}, 2010 [[US Social Forum]] People's Movement Assembly, Detroit, MI – June 22–26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grants and awards==
In 2009, the Seasons Fund for Social Transformation, a funding collaborative of representatives from small to large foundations, including W. W. [[Kellogg Foundation]], [[Ford Foundation]], Hidden Leaf Fund, [[Fetzer Institute]], [[Jewish Funds for Justice]], Seeds of Justice, [[Unitarian Universalist]] Veatch Program and small family funds held an inaugural Transformative Leadership Awards and awarded six collaborative teams $30,000 and two finalists $5,000 for their work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seasonsfund.org/?page_id=12 Transformative Leadership Awards, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Transformative social change is influenced by the work of social movements led by individuals that are viewed as attending to both their personal or spiritual development as well as systemic social issues because of the "realization that action is not enough":&lt;ref&gt;[http://seasonsfund.org/?page_id=16 Seasons Fund website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]
* [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]
* [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]
* [[Black Elk]]
* [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]

==Related work==
In 2002, scholars Raymond Allen Morrow and Carlos Alberto Torres used the phrase ''transformative social change'' as part of the subtitle in their book ''Reading Freire and Habermas: Critical Pedagogy and Transformative Social Change''&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Freire and Habermas: Critical Pedagogy and Transformative Social Change'', Teachers College Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8077-4202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a term to convey the intersection between [[Paulo Freire]]'s [[critical pedagogy]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]' critical social theory, and the implications those convergences have for educational practice. However, the term is never specifically defined in the book, nor is any distinct theory set 

The phrase is being applied{{By whom|date=May 2016}} as a social change field and movement in which developing inner awareness and nurturing one's inner life, i.e., personal development, is seen as essential in effective social justice work. This is taken to mean from an aligned, sustainable, and nonviolent place. It seeks to operationalize, in practical terms, the ideal of embodiment of the future desired state, in other words, to actualize [[Gandhi]]'s exhortation to "be the change."

While transformative social change has evolved to include secular practices with no specific spiritual ties, its emphasis on collective liberation shares history, principles and proponents with spiritual activism and liberation spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Horwitz &amp; Jesse Maceo Vega-Frey (2006). [http://www.berkana.org/articles/spiritual_activism.htm ''Spiritual Activism and Liberation Spirituality: Pathways To Collective Liberation'']&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it shares principles of [[transformative learning]] and [[transformative justice]], Examples of "transformative practice" include: yoga, meditation, centering prayer, tai chi, forward stance and types of somatic practices.

Transformative community organizing is being taught in university courses, in fields such as social work, community health, sociology, and other service learning classes.  Scholars such as Loretta Pyles have offered a transformative organizing framework, grounded in feminist social change work, and affirming a practice of collective and self-inquiry based on meditative traditions and social movement practices, such as popular education.&lt;ref&gt;Pyles, L. (2014). [https://www.amazon.com/Progressive-Community-Organizing-Reflective-Globalizing/dp/0415538084/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396640827&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=progressive+community+organizing ''Progressive Community Organizing: Reflective Practice in a Globalizing World'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC)''' was an international [[Advocacy group|advocacy]] organization, created in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424602884.html]&lt;/ref&gt; representing [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jewish refugees from Arab countries]]. The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries was created to make certain that any "just settlement of the refugee problem" recognizes those Jews who were forced to flee from lands where they had lived for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm THE OTHER REFUGEES: JEWS OF THE ARAB WORLD]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WOJAC functioned for approximately 25 years (from 1975 until 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Yehouda Shenhav.

Volume 29, Issue 1, 2002, Pages 27 - 56.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2016}} WOJAC's aspiration was to operate in the national arena, to counterbalance the claims of the Palestinian leadership on the right to the land and on the refugee question.

'''Wreath of wheat ears''' ({{lang-de|'''Ährenkranz'''}}) is a [[political symbol]], visually a [[wreath]] made of [[Ear (botany)|ears of wheat]]. It usually represents the class of [[farmers]] in the society.

The wreath of wheat ears appeared in emblems and logos of many socialist and [[communist countries]], especially the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet states]], for its symbolic meaning of peasantry.
