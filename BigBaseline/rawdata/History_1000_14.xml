*The year brings other significant changes in Detroit radio, as [[WDRQ]] flips from [[urban contemporary]] to [[soft AC]] as WLTI, and [[WYCD|WCLS]] flips from AC to rock-based Top 40 as WDTX.

==Debuts==

* [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] in Munich debuts with ''[[Bit, byte, gebissen]]'', the first radio program on computer topics in Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7604">The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that calls international attention to [[cultural heritage]] around the world that is threatened by [[neglect]], [[vandalism]], [[war|conflict]], or [[natural disaster|disaster]].&lt;ref name=press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = World Monuments Fund Announces 2018 World Monuments Watch | author = Hillary Prim | date = October 16, 2017 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url =https://www.wmf.org/press-release/world-monuments-fund-announces-2018-world-monuments-watch|accessdate= July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of Endangered Sites that are in urgent need of [[Historic preservation|preservation]] funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2006 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES |author=Holly Evarts |date= October 6, 2009 |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |accessdate= July 29, 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ab urbe condita''}}
[[Image:Antoninianus-Pacatianus-1001-RIC 0006cf.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Antoninianus]] of [[Pacatianus]], [[Roman usurper|usurper]] of Roman emperor [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] in 248. It bears the legend ROMAE AETER[NAE] AN[NO] MIL[LESIMO] ET PRIMO, "To eternal Rome, in its one thousand and first year".]]
'''''Ab urbe condita''''' ({{IPA-la|ab ˈʊrbɛ ˈkɔndɪtaː}}), or '''''Anno urbis conditæ''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈannoː ˈʊrbɪs ˈkɔndɪtae̯}}), often abbreviated as AUC in either case, is a convention that was used in antiquity and by [[Classicist|classical historians]] to refer to a given year in [[Ancient Rome]].  ''Ab urbe condita'' literally means "from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the City]]," while ''anno urbis conditæ'' means "in the year since the City's founding."  Therefore, the traditional year of the foundation of Rome, [[753 BC]], would be written AUC 1, while [[AD 1]] would be AUC 754. The foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] in 27 BC would be AUC 727.

Usage of the term was more common during the [[Renaissance]], when editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the convention was commonly used in antiquity.  In reality, the dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. In late antiquity, [[regnal years]] were also in use, as was the [[Diocletian era]] in Roman Egypt after AD 293, and in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 537, following a decree by [[Justinian]].

==Significance==
The traditional date for the founding of Rome, 21 April 753 BC, is due to  [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ([[1st century BC|First Century BC]]). Varro may have used the consular list (with its mistakes) and called the year of the first consuls "''ab urbe condita'' 245," accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of this calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.

From the time of [[Claudius]] (ruled AD 41 to AD 54) onward, this calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the anniversary of the city, in AD 48, the eight hundredth year from the founding of the city.{{cn|date=June 2016}} [[Hadrian]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, in AD 121, and in AD 147 and AD 148, respectively.

In AD 248, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum|sæculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states "[y]ear one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Sæculum Novum''.

==Calendar era==
{{see|Calendar era}}
The [[Anno Domini]] (AD) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in AD 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. 
Dionysius did not use the AUC convention, but instead based his calculations on the 
[[Diocletian era]].
This convention had been in use since AD 293, the year of the [[tetrarchy]], as it became impractical to use regnal years of the current emperor.&lt;ref&gt;

''Chronique d'Egypte'' 46.91 (1971),  173&amp;ndash;179, [https://doi.org/10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234 doi:10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234].&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Easter table, the year AD 532 was equated with the 248th regnal year of  Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November AD 284, or as stated by Dionysius: "''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare…''" ("but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ …").&lt;ref&gt;''Liber de Paschate'', [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC12663742&amp;id=LcEYeL-4ZuEC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+LXVII#PRA1-PT165,M1 Volume 67, page 481, note f]&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn and Holford-Strevens review interpretations of Dionysius which place the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'' (Oxford University Press, 2003 corrected reprinting, originally 1999) 778&amp;ndash;780.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has later been calculated{{by whom|date=May 2018}} (from the historical record of the succession of [[List of Roman consuls|Roman consuls]]) that the year AD 1 corresponds to AUC 754, based on the epoch of Varro. 
Thus, 
* AUC 1 = 753 BC
* AUC 753 = 1 BC
* AUC 754 = AD 1 
* AUC 1000 = AD 247
* AUC 2753 = AD 2000
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+752}} = AD {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}

An '''academic history''' can be a large, multivolume work such as the ''[[Cambridge Modern History]]'', written collaboratively under some central editorial control. 

In the 19th century, the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopedia was written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of ''natural'' history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different ''phyla.'' Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by [[Cambridge]] on [[Greco-Roman]] history, and that of [[Oxford]] on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century.  

What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or "cubbyhole in time", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be ''definitive'' even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not ''objective''. When the volume on the [[English Regency|Regency]] was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]] on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the ''Oxford History'' volumes to appear outdated.

It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th, there weren't any more academic histories. History is no longer subdivided in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. 

However, the project of [[globalization]] has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic, in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.

[[File:ages-in-chaos.jpg|right|thumb|''Ages in Chaos'' book cover]]

'''''Ages in Chaos''''' is a book by the controversial writer [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], first published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1952, which put forward a major revision of the history of the Ancient Near East, claiming that the histories of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Israel]] are five centuries out of step.  He followed this with a number of other works where he attempted to complete his reconstruction of ancient history, collectively known as the ''Ages in Chaos'' series.

Velikovsky's work has been harshly criticised, including even by some fellow chronological revisionists.

==Summary==
Velikovsky had put forward his ideas briefly in ''Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History'' in 1945, where he claimed that the history of the ancient Near East down to the time of [[Alexander the Great]] is garbled, but ''Ages in Chaos'' was his first full-length work on the subject.

His starting point for the first volume of the series was that [[the Exodus]] took place not, as orthodoxy has it, at some point during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]], but at the fall of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Ages in Chaos''&lt;/ref&gt;  In this and later volumes, he made heavy use of the concept of "ghost doubles" or alter-egos: historical figures who were known by different names in two different sources (e.g. Egyptian and Greek) and were considered to be entirely different people living in different centuries, but who he proposed to be actually erroneously dated accounts of the same individuals and events.

First he claimed that the [[Ipuwer Papyrus]] came from the beginning of Egypt's [[Second Intermediate Period]], and that this was an Egyptian account of the [[Plagues of Egypt]].  He then identified [[Dudimose|Tutimaios]] as the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] (much earlier than any of the mainstream candidates), the [[Hyksos]] with the biblical [[Amalek]]ites, the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] with the Biblical [[Queen of Sheba]], the [[land of Punt]] with [[Solomon]]'s kingdom, and Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] with the Biblical King [[Shishak]].  He claimed that the Egyptian [[Amarna letters]] from the late [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] describe events from the kingdoms of Israel and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], from roughly the time of King [[Ahab]].

== Later works on ancient history ==
[[File:GD-EG-Caire-Musée061.JPG|right|thumb|Akhnaton]]
A second volume was due for publication shortly after this but was postponed.  Instead it was followed in 1960 by ''Oedipus and Akhnaton'', where he claimed that the story of the Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] was the origin of the Greek legend of [[Oedipus]], and that [[Amenophis III]] was [[Laius]], and [[Tutankhamun]] was [[Eteocles]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two years of his life Velikovsky published a further two volumes of the series.  In ''Peoples of the Sea'' he dealt with the final period of his reconstruction, the Persian invasions of Egypt.  [[Manetho]]'s [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]] here becomes identified with the dynasties which ruled a newly independent Egypt in the early 4th century BCE, and [[Nectanebo I]] is a ghost double of [[Rameses III]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Peoples of the Sea''&lt;/ref&gt;  Rameses III fought invasions by the [[Sea Peoples]], including the "Peleset", conventionally identified with the [[Philistines]].  According to Velikovsky, the "Peleset" are actually the Persians and the other Sea Peoples are their Greek mercenaries.  The [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st dynasty]] then becomes a line of priest-kings who ruled in the [[oasis|oases]] simultaneously with the Persians.

[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|Ramses II]]
In ''Ramses II and His Time'' Velikovsky identified each of the major 19th dynasty pharaohs with a corresponding pharaoh of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]].  Thus, [[Ramses I]] was an alter-ego of [[Necho I]], [[Seti I]] of [[Psamtik I]], [[Ramses II]] of [[Necho II]], and [[Merneptah]] of [[Apries]].  In order to make these identifications work, Velikovsky claimed that the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] was an invention of modern historians, and the supposedly Hittite archaeological remains in modern [[Turkey]] were actually Chaldean, i.e. Neo-[[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]].  The Hittite kings are held to be ghost doubles of the Neo-Babylonian kings, and Rameses II's battle with the Hittites at [[Battle of Kadesh|Kadesh]] is identical to Necho's fight against [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]], [[Nabopolassar]] is [[Mursili II]], [[Neriglissar]] is [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]], [[Labashi-Marduk]] is [[Mursili III|Urhi-Teshup]], and Nebuchadrezzar II is [[Hattusili III]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Ramses II and His Time''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death he considered that completing his reconstruction of ancient history would require a further two volumes: ''The Assyrian Conquest'' and ''The Dark Age of Greece''; these were never published in print in English, but online versions are available at the Velikovsky archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varchive.org/ The Immanuel Velikovsky Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former work, Velikovsky separated the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th]] and [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasties]], specifically arguing that over a century separated [[Ay]] and [[Horemheb]], conventionally regarded as his successor.  Instead, he had the 22nd through 25th dynasties follow upon the earlier part of the 18th, leading down to the Assyrian invasions of the early 7th century BCE.  The "great king" who crowned Horemheb was the Assyrian king.

The books have remained popular.  The British publisher [[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]] reprinted ''Ages in Chaos'' ten times between 1953 and 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Velikovsky |1977 |p=iv (publisher's summary)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paradigma reprinted it as recently as 2009.

==Controversy and criticism==
The revised chronology proposed by ''Ages in Chaos'' has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]]. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, William]] 1952. ''New York Herald Tribune Book Review'' April 20. Retelling the Near East's Ancient History. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Waldemar Kaempffert|Kaempffert, Waldemar]] 1952. ''New York Times Book Review'' April 20. Solomon, the Queen of Sheba, and the Egypt of Exodus. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiebing, Jr., William H. 1984. Cosmic Catastrophism, Chap. III, in ''Ancient Astronauts, Cosmic Collisions'' Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-260-2}}. pp. 57-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965 the leading cuneiformist [[Abraham Sachs]], in a forum at [[Brown University]], discredited Velikovsky's use of [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;see transcript in ''Aeon'' 1992, Vol.3 No.1, pp.103-5, and also http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/vsachs.html&lt;/ref&gt; Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs' attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, Leroy]] 1992. ''Aeon'' '''3''' (1), section "Bonanza from Brown" in "Of Lessons, Legacies, and Litmus Tests: A Velikovsky Potpourri (Part One)", pp. 88-90. "Velikovsky confronted a panel of four professors [at Brown University on March 15, 1965]: [[Leon Cooper|Leon N. Cooper]] (physics), Bruno J Giletti (geology), Charles Smiley (astronomy) and Abraham J. Sachs (history of mathematics) [who was substituting for [[Otto Neugebauer]] ], moderated by [[Henry Kučera]] (linguistics). In the event, Velikovsky debated the first three handily. He was stunned by Sachs whose address was both a rhetorical and substantive ''tour de force''. Velikovsky's rebuttal began: 'Dr. Sachs threw so many accusations in that [[Philippic]] of his that I am at a difficulty to answer; but I invite Dr. Sachs to spend the hour and a half tomorrow at the meeting [at Diman House], and every one of you too, and point by point each of his statements will be proven wrong.' Unfortunately, Sachs did not show up the next day and Velikovsky did not even mention Sachs [according to the tape recording of the proceedings in the possession of [http://www.velikovsky.info/Warner_B._Sizemore Warner B. Sizemore] who loaned it to Ellenberger March 31, 1979]. Curiously, Velikovsky's file for the Brown trip contains typed rebuttals to all the panelists ''except'' Sachs, for whom only partial, penciled notes exist&amp;mdash;but later that year Velikovsky would reply to Kim J. Masters, a Princeton sophomore, within a week in ''The Daily Princetonian'' (Nov. 15, 1965) over a criticism of ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''. Velikovsky's rebuttal to Masters was scathing, running the gamut from haggling over details to ''ad hominems''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[fringe science]] expert [[Henry H. Bauer]] wrote ''Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy'', which ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' described as "the definitive treatise debunking Immanuel Velikovsky".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1064461-2,00.html | title = Science on the Fringe | publisher = [[Time magazine]] | author = Michael D. Lemonick/Gainesville | date = 2005-05-24 | accessdate = 2008-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bauer accused Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting his own point of view to be correct, where at best this is only one possible interpretation of the historical material in question, and gives several examples from ''Ages in Chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Bauer |1999 |pp=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Egyptologist David Lorton produced a detailed critique of chapter 3 of ''Ages in Chaos'', which identifies Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba, e.g. accusing Velikovsky of mistakes which he would have avoided if he had a basic knowledge of the languages of the ancient near east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reocities.com/Athens/academy/1326/hatshepsut.html Lorton, David ''Hatshepsut, the Queen of Sheba, and Immanuel Velikovsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's ''Ages in Chaos'' series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in [[Glasgow]] specifically to debate the revised chronology.&lt;ref&gt;"Ages in Chaos?'-Proceedings of the Residential Weekend Conference, Glasgow, 7th-9th April 1978" ''Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Review'' Vol. VI, issue 1/2/3 84pp (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and [[David Rohl]], was that this particular revision of chronology was untenable,&lt;ref&gt;Bimson, "Finding the Limits of Chronological Revision" in "Proceedings of the SIS Conference: Ages Still in Chaos" ''Chronology &amp; Catastrophism Review'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; although they considered that the work had highlighted problems with the orthodox chronology.&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{harvnb |James |1991 |p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rohl, one of those involved in the 1978 Glasgow conference, has developed his own revised chronology. While he agrees that the Exodus should be dated to the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, and that Tutimaios is the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]],&lt;ref name=rohl283&gt;{{harvnb |Rohl |1995 |p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are few points of contact between the Velikovsky and Rohl chronologies, largely because of the different methodologies used to resolve the later periods.&lt;ref name=rohl402&gt;{{harvnb |Rohl |1995 |p=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James, another Glasgow delegate who went on to publish a work challenging the concept of a widespread dark age at the [[Bronze Age collapse|end of the Bronze Age]], credited Velikovsky with "point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology", but criticised Velikovsky's chronology as "disastrously extreme", producing "a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve" and noted that "Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy".&lt;ref name=James/&gt;

One important disagreement is that Rohl and James consider that the chronology of the ancient Near East becomes fixed by the conquests of the [[Assyria]]ns in the 7th century BCE.  Velikovsky carried his revisionism into the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], and considered that chronology only becomes fixed by the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BCE.  They have also rejected some of Velikovsky's more extreme claims e.g. non-existence of Hittite Empire, changing the order of some Egyptian dynasties.  Rohl and James's views remain controversial and are not accepted by most historians.

==Legacy== 
In spite of the unrelenting hostility of mainstream historians, Velikovsky's revisionism continues to attract adherents. Following his death in 1979 Velikovsky's theories were championed by Lynn E. Rose, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[University at Buffalo|Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ginenthal is the founder and principal contributor to an online journal ''The Velikovskian''. He has also authored a series of revisionist works under the title ''Pillars of the Past''. Emmet Sweeney has published his chronological revisions in a series of works entitled ''Ages in Alignment''.

Far from slavishly championing Velikovsky's chronology, these scholars believe that Velikovsky did not go far enough. Under the influence of [[Gunnar Heinsohn]] they have shortened Velikovsky's timeline of ancient history even more. The 12th Dynasty of ancient Egypt has been moved almost 1500 years closer to the present, ending with Alexander the Great's invasion in -331.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Little if any of this has been endorsed by the mainstream historians.

"'''Arrested decay'''" is a term coined by the State of [[California]], [[United States]] to explain how it would preserve its [[Bodie, California|Bodie State Historic Park]].  A more common application of this concept is the preservation of war ruins as memorials.

Any building that was standing in 1962, when Bodie became a State Park, may be rebuilt or preserved as the photographs of 1962 showed them. By putting new roofs on the buildings, rebuilding foundations, and resealing glass that is in window frames, the State is able to keep buildings from naturally decaying.

[[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] uses a similar system, though it uses the term "'''preserved ruin'''."

== Croatia ==
The authorities in [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]] decided to keep the [[Vukovar water tower|old water tower in the city]] as it is found today and as it had become after the war &amp;mdash; gnarled by [[artillery]].

== Berlin, Germany ==
Several buildings destroyed in the [[World War II|Second World War]] have been preserved in their ruined condition as memorials.  These include part of the facade of the [[Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof|Anhalter Bahnhof]] and the belfry of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]].

== Sarajevo, Bosnia ==
The authorities in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] have also preserved the building of the daily newspaper [[Oslobođenje]] to this day the way it was shelled during the [[Bosnian War]].

== Hiroshima, Japan ==
In 1996,  the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]]  was acknowledged as a [[World Heritage Site|Unesco World Heritage Site]]. Originally completed in 1905, the building was known at the time of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|Hiroshima atomic bomb explosion]] on August 6, 1945  as the ''Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall''. Although suffering considerable damage, it was the closest structure to the [[hypocenter]] of the explosion to withstand the blast without being leveled to the ground. It has been preserved in the condition it was in after the bombing to serve as a symbol of hope for [[world peace]] and [[nuclear disarmament]].

== Oradour-sur-Glane, France ==
[[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was a village in the [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] [[Regions of France|région]] of [[France]] that was destroyed on 10 June 1944, when 642 of its inhabitants &amp;ndash; men, women and children &amp;ndash; were murdered by a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Waffen-SS]] company. Although a new village was built after World War II, away from the ruins of the former village, the old village &amp;ndash; the site of the massacre &amp;ndash; still stands as a memorial to the dead and as being representative of similar sites and events. Part of the memorial includes items recovered from the burned out buildings: watches stopped at the time their owners were burned alive; glasses &amp;ndash; melted from the intense heat; and various personal items and money.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">'''Beef rings''' are cooperative groups of six to twenty-four farms, with each member of the cooperative being required to supply one animal over the course of the summer to the cooperative for [[animal slaughter|slaughter]] they are either done locally on the farm or at a [[slaughterhouse]] at the member's expense. 

==Information==
Beef rings were common among [[North America]]n farmers who had no means for [[refrigeration]] of meat until the beginning of the 20th century. Although pigs were small enough that a smoked [[pork]] carcass could be consumed by a single farming family before the meat spoiled, the same was not true of [[cattle]], and smoked or salted beef was not popular in any case.&lt;ref name=MacLachlan&gt;{{cite book|title=Kill and Chill|author=Ian MacLachlan|pages=124|publisher=University of Toronto Press|date=2002|isbn13=9780802078322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining the slaughtered steer, the meat would be distributed among the members of the cooperative, providing them with a [[steak]], a [[roast beef|roast]], and a boiling [[joint]] each week.&lt;ref name=MacLachlan/&gt; By slaughtering each animal in sequence, the cooperative ensured that all members received fresh meat throughout the summer. Distributions were weighed, so that each member received a fair share of the meat.&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite book|title=Farmers "making Good"|author=Lyle Dick|pages=170|publisher=University of Calgary Press|date=2008|isbn13=9781552382417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beef rings died out for several reasons, including technological advances in refrigeration, greater economic prosperity for farmers, greater independence, and the ability of farmers to buy meat at butchers' shops rather than slaughter and store it themselves.&lt;ref name=Dick/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">A '''blade mill''' was a variety of [[water mill]] used for sharpening newly fabricated [[blade]]s, including [[scythe]]s, [[sword]]s, [[sickle]]s, and [[knife|knives]].  

In the [[Sheffield]] area, they were known as cutlers wheels, scythesmiths wheels, etc.  Examples are preserved in [[Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]].  They also existed in the 17th century and 18th century in [[Birmingham]] and in connection with the [[scythe]] industry in [[Belbroughton]] and [[Chaddesley Corbett]] in north [[Worcestershire]].  There were also small numbers in other areas of England.  

A [[water wheel]] was used to turn a grind stone, which wore down from being up to two metres in diameter to a 'cork' of a fraction of this size.  The dust generated by the process was bad for the grinder's health, and many of them died young from [[silicosis|'grinder's disease']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7405">The '''Borussian myth''' or '''Borussian legend'''&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Michael (1992). ''Early Modern Germany, 1477-1806'', MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. xi. {{ISBN|0-8122-1427-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given by 20th-century historians of German history to the earlier idea that [[German unification]] was inevitable, and that it was [[Prussia]]'s destiny to accomplish it.  The Borussian myth is an example of a [[teleological]] argument.  ''Borussia'' is the Latin name for Prussia.

==Teleological arguments==
A teleological argument holds all things to be designed for, or directed toward, a specific final result.  That specific result gives events and actions, even retrospectively, an inherent purpose.  When applied to the historical process, an historical teleological argument posits the result as the inevitable trajectory of a specific set of events.  These events lead "inevitably," as [[Karl Marx]] or [[Friedrich Engels]] proposed, to a specific set of conditions or situations; the resolution of those lead to another, and so on.  This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the historical process as a whole is present in a variety of arguments about the past: the "inevitability," for example, of the revolution of the proletariat and the [[Whig history|"Whiggish"]] narrative of past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment that culminated in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Butterfield]], ''The Whiggish Interpretation of History,'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinning the myth==

The narrative of the heroic past fell to such nationalist German historians as  [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] (1834–1896), [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), and [[Heinrich von Sybel]] (1817–1895), to name three. Treitschke in particular viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, ''The peculiarities of German history: bourgeois society and politics in nineteenth-century Germany.'' Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-19-873057-6}} p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; These historical arguments can also be called the grand, or great, narratives but they are inherently [[ethnocentric]], at least when applied to the historical process.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  Treitschke's'' History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century'', published in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges the history of Prussia over the history of other German states, and it tells the story of the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this myth (''Borussia'' is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Friedrich, ''The other Prussia: royal Prussia, Poland and liberty, 1569–1772'', New York, 2000, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. This interpretation emphasizes Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of [[Napoleon]]'s power in 1814, at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], creating some semblance of economic unity through the ''[[Zollverein]]'' (German customs union), and uniting Germans under one proud flag after the defeat of France in the [[Franco Prussian War]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Many modern historians describe this myth, without subscribing to it: for example, Rudy Koshar, ''Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and the National Memory in the Twentieth Century.'' Chapel Hill, 1998; Hans Kohn. ''German history; some new German views.'' Boston, 1954; Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany history from Napoleon to Bismarck.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deconstructing the myth==

After [[World War II]], various historians of Germany sought to re-examine the German past, in part to understand the immediate German past and the [[Holocaust]], and in part to understand Germany's supposed [[democratic deficit]]: Theoretically, Germans were inexperienced with democracy and self-government because their experience in unification came under the leadership of the least democratic of the German states (Prussia). This inevitably led to, first, [[World War I]], and second the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]], third, to the rise of [[National Socialism]], and fourth, to [[World War II]].

The Borussian myth was linked to the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' theory of Germany's ''peculiar road'' to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, ''Peculiarities of German History,'' p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  The set of circumstances that predated the Unification, for example, the so-called failure of the [[1848 revolution|1848 German revolutions]] and the elimination of [[German dualism|Austria]] as a possible leader in the unification process strengthen the myth's appeal.  In this way, teleological arguments tend to work backward from an event, to describe and rationalize all trends leading to it;&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  they are [[genealogy|genealogical]]&amp;mdash;trace from the present to the past&amp;mdash;rather than historical, which explores the past to the present.

In the 1970s, and later, as [[social history|social]] and [[cultural history|cultural]] historians examined nineteenth-century German history in greater depth, they realized that not only was there a vibrant and lively German culture without Prussia, but they also deconstructed significant elements of the ''Sonderweg'' theory as well.  They discovered, for example, that the 1848 Revolutions in Germany actually had some significant successes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, Rhineland radicals: the democratic movement and the revolution of 1848–1849. Princeton, N.J., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the history of 19th-century Germany was not a long process of grinding under the heel of Prussian militarism, but instead a process of economic expansion, testing of democratic institutions, the writing and testing of constitutions, and the creation of social insurance systems to maintain long term economic security.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn, ''The long nineteenth century: a history of Germany, 1780–1918.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507672-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Roman–Sassanid War of 440''' was a short conflict between the [[East Roman Empire]] and the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Empire]]. The reason for its short ending was that the southern Roman provinces were being invaded by the [[Vandals]], which forced the East Romans to sue for a quick end to the war to focus on the Vandal invasion.

[[File:Consensus Tigurinus.jpg|thumb|Title page of 1551 Geneva edition]]
The '''''Consensus Tigurinus''''' or '''Consensus of Zurich''' was a document intended to bring unity to the [[Protestant]] churches on their doctrines of the [[sacraments]], particularly the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]. [[John Calvin]], who stood in between the [[Lutheran]] view of [[Real Presence]] and the [[Zwingli]]an view of pure symbolism,  wrote the first draft of the document in November 1548, with notes by [[Heinrich Bullinger]]. It taught:

:that the Sacraments are not in and of themselves effective and conferring [[divine grace|grace]], but that God, through the [[Holy Spirit]], acts through them as means; that the internal effect appears only in the [[predestination|elect]]; that the good of the Sacraments consists in leading us to [[Christ]], and being instruments of the grace of God, which is sincerely offered to all; that in [[baptism]] we receive the remission of sins, although this proceeds primarily not from baptism, but from the blood of Christ; that in the Lord's Supper we eat and drink the body and blood of Christ, not, however, by means of a carnal presence of Christ's human nature, which is in heaven, but by the power of the Holy Spirit and the devout elevation of our soul to  heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.ii.ix.html |title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes |volume=I |author=[[Philip Schaff]] |chapter=The Consensus of Zurich. A.D. 1549 |pages=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin sent the document to the Swiss churches, but the Synod at [[Berne]] opposed Calvin's view strongly and continued to do so until after Calvin's death. In May 1549, Calvin met with [[William Farel]] and Bullinger in [[Zurich]], and the three revised the document into its final form, which was published in Zurich and [[Geneva]] in 1551. It attempted to coalesce the Calvinist and the advanced Zwinglian doctrines while standing opposed to [[transubstantiation]], the [[Roman Catholic]] view, and [[sacramental union]], the Lutheran view. It was accepted by the churches in Zurich, Geneva,  [[Saint Gall]], [[Schaffhausen]], the [[Grisons]], [[Neuchâtel]], and eventually by [[Basel]], and brought them into harmony with one another. It was "favorably received" in France, England, and parts of Germany, but while [[Melancthon]] said that he understood the Swiss for the first time and would no longer write against them, it was attacked by the [[Gnesio-Lutheran]] [[Joachim Westphal (of Hamburg)|Joachim Westphal]] and "became the innocent occasion of the second sacramental war."&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, pp. 472–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crippen Point site''' is a [[Coles Creek culture]] [[archaeological site]] located in [[Sharkey County, Mississippi]]. It is the archaeological [[type site]] of the Crippen Point phase(1050 to 1200 CE) for Late Coles Creek culture in the Lower [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valley. The phase marks a significant change in the cultural history of the area. Population increased dramatically and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity by this portion of the Coles Creek sequence. Although many of the classic traits of [[chiefdom]] societies are not yet manifested, by 1000 CE the formation of simple elite polities had begun. Sites for this phase are found in [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]]. After the Crippen Point phase the [[Plaquemine culture]] period begins.

[[File:Kyrgyz Manaschi, Karakol.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Kyrgyz ''[[Epic of Manas|manaschi]]'' performing part of the epic poem (dastan) at a yurt camp in [[Karakol]]]]
'''Dastan''' ({{lang-fa|داستان}} ''dâstân'', meaning "story" or "tale")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steingass|first=Francis Joseph|authorlink=Francis Joseph Steingass|title=A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary, Including the Arabic Words and Phrases to Be Met with in Persian Literature|place=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul|year=1892|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:5495.steingass}}{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Ralph|authorlink=Ralph Russell|year=1992|title=The Pursuit of Urdu Literature: A Select History|place=London and New Jersey|publisher=Zed Books|page=85|ISBN=1-85649-029-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ornate form of [[oral history]] from [[Central Asia]]. 

A dastan is generally centered on one individual who protects his tribe or his people from an outside invader or enemy, although only occasionally can this figure be traced back to a historical person. This main character sets an example of how one should act, and the dastan becomes a teaching tool — for example the [[Sufi]] master and Turkic poet [[Khoja Akhmet Yassawi|Ahmet Yesevi]] said "Let the scholars hear my wisdom, treating my words like a dastan".{{Quote without source|date=November 2018}} Alongside the wisdom, each dastan is rich with cultural history of interest to scholars.

During the [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|Russian invasion and occupation of Central Asia]], many new dastans were created to protest the Russian occupation. It is possible that they came into contact and influenced each other. According to Turkish historian [[Hasan Bülent Paksoy]], the [[Bolsheviks]] tried to destroy these symbols of culture, e.g. by only publishing them in insufficiently large quantities and in a distorted form "in order to weaken the heroic impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paksoy|first=H.B.|authorlink=Hasan Bülent Paksoy|chapter-url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/paksoy-6/cae05.html|chapter=Dastan Genre in Central Asia|title=Essays on Central Asia|year=1999|place=Lawrence|publisher=Carrie|pages=82|OCLC=45603165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable dastan is ''[[Book of Dede Korkut|Korkut Ata]]'' of the [[Oghuz Turks]] — which may have been created as early as the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meeker|first=Michael E.|title=The Dede Korkut Ethic|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=24|issue=3|date=August 1992|pages=395–417|doi=10.1017/S0020743800021954|quote=The ''Book of Dede Korkut'' is an early record of oral [[Turkish folklore|Turkic folktales]] in [[Anatolia]], and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the ''Book of Dede Korkut'' consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among [[Turkic peoples]] living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to [[Geoffrey Lewis (scholar)|Lewis]] (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the [[Aq Qoyunlu|Akkoyunlu Confederation]] of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves “Turcoman” rather than “Oghuz,” had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2454">'''Diocles of Peparethus''' ({{lang-el|Διοκλῆς}}; fl. late 4th – early 3rd century BC) was a historian from the Greek island of [[Peparethus]]. His works are lost, but they included histories of Persia and Rome: [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]] and [[Plutarch]] acknowledge their debts to the latter as a source for their histories of early Rome, its native traditions and ancestral Greek connections.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives, Life of Romulus'', 3. Loeb edn. available at Thayer's site: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/romulus*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Fabius' work survives only as a brief but historically significant catalogue summary. Plutarch seems to have relied on Fabius' history but acknowledges Diocles as its basis and authority. Diocles' own sources are unknown. He may have had access to Roman sources and traditions on which he foisted Greek interpretations and interpolations.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldo Momigliano, ''The classical foundations of modern historiography'', University Presses of California, Columbia and Princeton, 1990, p101; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Djv5ttMz-HYC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Diocles+of+peparethus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NreVzMV8R4&amp;sig=5CfZzc2PTD3cf5-fvnNAsABbnMA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q51pS_fEOaWy0gS8pNWpCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Diocles%20of%20peparethus&amp;f=false]: see also Dillery, in Andrew Feldherr (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Historians, Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp78-81.

Little else is known of Diocles. He appears to have been a figure of note, well travelled, and abstemious; [[Athenaeus]] cites Demetrius of Scepsis to attest that Diocles "drank cold water to the day of his death".&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus: ''The Deipnosophists'', 22 (trans.

The '''Dominican Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Dominicano}}, PD) was the ''[[de facto]]'' [[One-party state|only political party]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] during the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]], who ruled the country from 1930 to 1961. Its symbol was a [[Arecaceae|palm tree]].

== History ==
The Dominican Party was founded on 2 August 1931, a year after Trujillo came to power. It was an outgrowth of the "Patriotic Coalition of Citizens" that supported Trujillo's run for president. Soon afterward, it was proclaimed to be the only legal party.

On 16 August 1935, the HIN radio station, known as "The Voice of the Dominican Party", was opened. It was dedicated to serving as the media propagator of the activities of the Dominican Party.

The insignia of the Party had a motto that coincided with Trujillo's initials:

*'''R'''ectitud (Righteousness) = Rafael
*'''L'''ibertad (Freedom; Liberty) = Leonidas
*'''T'''rabajo (Work; Labour; Job) = Trujillo.

Later, he added: '''M'''oralidad (Morality) = Molina.

Officially, Trujillo was only president from 1930 until 1938 and from 1942 until 1952, and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1953 until 1961.  However, for 30 years he held the real power as leader of the Dominican Party and [[Generalissimo]] of the [[Dominican Army]]. In these roles, he was able to ensure that when he was not actually president, the position was held by family members or politicians allied to him: [[Jacinto Peynado]] (President from 1938 until 1940), [[Manuel de Jesús Troncoso de la Concha]] (President from 1940 until 1942), his brother [[Héctor Trujillo|Hector]] (President from 1952 until 1960), and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (took office as president in 1960; was president at the time of Trujillo's death). In this way, for the 31 years of his rule, he was able to maintain all governing power in the nation while appearing to be honorable and only hold power for 18 years.

All adult citizens of the Dominican Republic were required to be members of the party. They needed to carry "[the] three strikes" ({{lang-es|"los tres golpes"}})

*Personal Identity Card
*Compulsory Military Service Card
*Dominican Party Membership Card, popularly known as "La Palmita"

The party had no real ideology other than support for Trujillo.  It lingered for a brief time after Trujillo's assassination in 1961.  However, it was apparent there was no place for the party in the more open society, and it was finally wound up in January 1962.

At various times, Trujillo allowed other political parties to coexist.  However, this was done only to impress foreign observers that democratization was progressing, and to allow Trujillo to monitor opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crassweller RD |title=Trujillo.

{{Periods in English History}}

The '''Georgian era''' is a period in [[British history]] from 1714 to {{circa|1830&amp;ndash;37}}, named after the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] kings [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. The sub-period that is the [[Regency era]] is defined by the regency of George IV as [[Prince of Wales]] during the illness of his father George III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-III |title=George III King of Great Britain |author=John Steven Watson  |website=Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the Georgian era is often extended to include the relatively short reign of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], which ended with his death in 1837.

The term "[[wikt:Georgian|Georgian]]" is typically used in the contexts of social and political history [[Georgian architecture|and architecture]].  The term "[[Augustan literature]]" is often used for [[Augustan drama]], [[Augustan poetry]] and [[Augustan prose]] in the period 1700–1740s. The term "Augustan" refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of [[Latin literature]] from the ancient [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Lund,  ''Ridicule, Religion and the Politics of Wit in Augustan England'' (Ashgate, 2013) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
Georgian society and its preoccupations were well portrayed in the novels of writers such as [[Henry Fielding]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Jane Austen]], characterised by the architecture of [[Robert Adam]], [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[James Wyatt]] and the emergence of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, which hearkened back to a supposed [[Golden Age|golden age]] of building design.

The flowering of the arts was most vividly shown in the emergence of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, principally through [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[William Blake]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Robert Burns]]. Their work ushered in a new era of poetry, characterised by vivid and colourful language, evocative of elevating ideas and themes.

The paintings of [[Thomas Gainsborough]], Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and the young [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[John Constable]] illustrated the changing world of the Georgian period – as did the work of designers like [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown|Capability Brown]], the [[Landscape architecture|landscape designer]].

Fine examples of distinctive Georgian architecture are Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], [[Georgian Dublin]], [[Grainger Town]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the Georgian Quarter of [[Liverpool]] and much of Bristol and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

The music of [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], [[Handel]], [[Haydn]], [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]] and [[Mendelssohn]] was some of the most popular in England at that time.

==Social change==
It was a time of immense social change in Britain, with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] which began the process of intensifying [[social class|class divisions]], and the emergence of rival [[political party|political parties]] like the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]].

In rural areas the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] saw huge changes to the movement of people and the decline of small communities, the growth of the cities and the beginnings of an integrated [[historic transport|transportation system]] but, nevertheless, as rural towns and villages declined and work became scarce there was a huge increase in [[emigration]] to Canada, the [[Thirteen Colonies|North American colonies]] (which became the United States during the period) and other parts of the [[British Empire]].

===Evangelical religion and social reform===
The evangelical movement inside and outside the [[Church of England]] gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century. The movement challenged the traditional religious sensibility that emphasized a code of honor for the upper-class, and suitable behaviour for everyone else, together with faithful observances of rituals. [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791) and his followers preached revivalist religion, trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading, regular prayer, and especially the revival experience. Wesley himself preached 52,000 times, calling on men and women to "redeem the time" and save their souls. Wesley always operated inside the Church of England, but at his death, it set up outside institutions that became the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Armstrong, ''The Church of England: the Methodists and society, 1700–1850'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  It stood alongside the traditional nonconformist churches, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers. The nonconformist churches, however, were less influenced by revivalism.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The age of improvement, 1783–1867'' (1959), pp 66–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England remained dominant, but it had a growing evangelical, revivalist faction the "Low Church". Its leaders included [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Hannah More]]. It reached the upper class through the [[Clapham Sect]]. It did not seek political reform, but rather the opportunity to save souls through political action by freeing slaves, abolishing the duel, prohibiting cruelty to children and animals, stopping gambling, avoiding frivolity on the Sabbath; they read the Bible every day. All souls were equal in God's view, but not all bodies, so evangelicals did not challenge the hierarchical structure of English society.&lt;ref&gt;John Rule, ''Albion's People: English Society 1714–1815'' (1992) ch 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;  As R.J. Morris noted in his 1983 article "Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850," "[m]id-eighteenth-century Britain was a stable society in the sense that those with material and ideological power were able to defend this power in an effective and dynamic manner," but "in the twenty years after 1780, this consensus structure was broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=R.J.|date=March 1983|title=Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850: An Analysis|url=|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=26|issue=1|pages=99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglican Evangelicalism thus, as historian Lisa Wood has argued in her book ''Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel After the French Revolution'', functioned as a tool of ruling-class social control, buffering the discontent that in France had inaugurated a revolution; yet it contained within itself the seeds for challenge to gender and class hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel after the French Revolution|last=Wood|first=Lisa|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Lewisburg, PA|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire==
The Georgian period saw  continual warfare, including the [[Seven Years' War]], known in America as the [[French and Indian War]] (1756–63), the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802), the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–15).  The British won most of the wars except for the American Revolution, where the combined weight of the United States, France, Spain and the Netherlands overwhelmed Britain, which stood alone without allies.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of some of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] in the [[American War of Independence]] was regarded as a national disaster and was seen by some foreign observers as heralding the end of Britain as a [[great power]]. In Europe, the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France]] dragged on for nearly a quarter of a century, 1793–1815. Victory over [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) and the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815) under  [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] brought a sense of triumphalism and political reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Eliga H. Gould, "American independence and Britain's counter-revolution", ''Past &amp; Present'' (1997) #154 pp 107–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of empire brought fame to statesmen and explorers such as [[Robert Clive|Clive of India]] and [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], and sowed the seeds of the worldwide British Empire of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s which were to follow.

===The trading nation===
The era was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:
:we are the most "diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p 344&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Evans, ''The forging of the modern state: early industrial Britain, 1783–1872'' (1996) p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. "'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals." ''Business history review'' 62#3 (1988): 398-419.

[[Mercantilism]] was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204–211]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a large and powerful Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607–1755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the companies earned good profits, and enormous personal fortunes were created in India, but there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to ₤31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from ₤130 a share to ₤1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king.  The prime minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) pp 334–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Myths of the South Sea Bubble", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141–165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and social revolt==
With the ending of the [[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]], Great Britain entered a period of greater economic depression and political uncertainty, characterised by social discontent and unrest. The [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] political party published a leaflet called ''The Political Register'', also known as "The Two Penny Trash" to its rivals. The so-called [[Blanketeers|March of the Blanketeers]] saw 400 [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]] and [[Weaving|weavers]] march from [[Manchester]] to London in March 1817 to hand the Government a petition. The [[Luddite]]s destroyed and damaged machinery in the industrial north-west of England. The [[Peterloo Massacre]] in 1819 began as a protest rally which saw 60,000 people gathering to protest about their living standards, but was quelled by military action and saw eleven people killed and 400 wounded. The [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] of 1820 sought to blow up the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] and then move on to storm the [[Tower of London]] and overthrow the government. This too was thwarted, with the conspirators executed or [[penal transport|transported]] to Australia.

==Enlightenment==
{{Further|Age of Enlightenment}}
Historians have long explored the importance of the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as the American Enlightenment,&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Koch, ed., ''The American enlightenment: The shaping of the American experiment and a free society'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; while debating the very existence of the English Enlightenment.

===Scottish Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
English historian [[Peter Gay]] argues that the Scottish Enlightenment "was a small and cohesive group of friends – David Hume, Adam Smith,  Adam Ferguson, and others – who knew one another intimately and talked to one another incessantly.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Education was a priority in Scotland, both at the local level and especially in four universities that had stronger reputations than any in England.  The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions that took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as [[The Select Society]] and, later, [[The Poker Club]] as well as within Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient universities]] ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Daniel Eddy, "Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership", in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall, eds., ''The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Vol. II: Enlightenment and Expansion, 1707–1800'' (2012),
 pp 297-309 [https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing the [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] outlook of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing [[empiricism]] and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.  Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, economics, history architecture, and medicine. Leaders included  [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Playfair]], [[Joseph Black]] and [[James Hutton]].  The Scottish Enlightenment influenced England and the American colonies, and to a lesser extent continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David  Daiches, Peter Jones, Jean Jones, eds., ''A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment 1731–1790'' (Edinburgh UP, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English Enlightenment===
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars.   The majority of textbooks and standard surveys make no room for an English Enlightenment. Some European surveys include England, others ignore it but do include as enlightenment intellectuals such representative Englishmen as Newton, Locke, Jonathan Swift, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the  reason for the neglect was the assumption that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that after the 1720s, England could claim few thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. Indeed, its leading intellectuals, such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book|author=José Rabasa et al. eds.|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing|volume=3: 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=518–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]], and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supported the standing order.  Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England, and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. The coffee-house culture provided an ideal venue for enlightened conversation. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent, and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp 1–12, 36-37, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ghaza''' or '''Ghazi thesis''' (from {{lang-ota|غزا}}, ''ġazā'', "holy war," or simply "raid"){{refn|group=nb|The ''Cambridge History of Turkey'' defines ''ghaza'' as "a raid for plunder, later came to mean holy war fought for Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor= Kate Fleet |title=The Cambridge History of Turkey |volume= 1, Byzantium to Turkey, 1071–1453 |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |page=424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a historical [[paradigm]] first formulated by [[Paul Wittek]] which has been used to interpret the nature of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the earliest period of its history, the fourteenth century,&lt;ref name=Kafadar&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=xi–xii }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its subsequent history. The thesis addresses the question of how the Ottomans were able to expand from a small principality on the frontier of the [[Byzantine Empire]] into a centralized, intercontinental empire. According to the Ghaza thesis, the Ottomans accomplished this by attracting recruits to fight for them in the name of [[Islamic holy war]] against the [[kafir|non-believers]]. Such a warrior was known in [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] as a ''[[ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', and thus this thesis sees the early Ottoman state as a "Ghazi State," defined by an ideology of holy war. The Ghaza Thesis dominated early Ottoman historiography throughout much of the twentieth century before coming under increasing criticism beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Kafadar" /&gt; Historians now generally reject the Ghaza Thesis, and consequently the idea that Ottoman expansion was primarily fueled by holy war, but are conflicted with regard to what to replace it with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor= Kate Fleet |title=The Cambridge History of Turkey |volume= 1, Byzantium to Turkey, 1071–1453 |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |last=Lindner |first=Rudi Paul |page=104 |chapter= Anatolia, 1300–1451 |quote=Scholars following in Wittek's footsteps have moved away from his strong formulation [...] It is probably safe to suggest that at the moment there is no agreed point of reference about which most scholars gather, and that a more eclectic approach, resting more on the sources than on scholarly tradition, holds the field. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ghaza/&gt;

==Formation of the Ghaza thesis==

The Ghaza thesis was first formulated in the 1930s by Turkish historian [[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü|Fuat Köprülü]] and Austrian historian [[Paul Wittek]]. Partly in response to contemporary [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] historians, who tried to marginalize the role of the Turks in Ottoman state formation, Köprülü formulated what was to become the [[Turkish nationalist]] view of early Ottoman history. According to Köprülü, the Ottoman polity was formed by Turkish tribes fleeing the advance of the [[Mongol Empire]], built upon Turkish tribal manpower, and administered by men from the Anatolian hinterland experienced in the Turco-Muslim political tradition of the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuks]]. Paul Wittek, responding to Köprülü's claims, accepted the Turco-Muslim basis of the early Ottoman state, agreeing that it grew out of the already highly developed civilization of Seljuk Anatolia and was fundamentally shaped by the unique conditions of the Byzantine frontier. Yet rather than Turkish ethnicity and tribal connections, he placed his primary emphasis upon the role of Islam. For Wittek, the Ottomans were first and foremost Islamic holy warriors. His primary evidence for this included the titles adopted by early Ottoman rulers, including an inscription erected in [[Bursa]] in 1337 describing [[Orhan]], the second Ottoman ruler, as "ghazi, son of ghazi." Wittek also relied upon the work of the early fifteenth-century Ottoman poet Ahmedi, who likewise described the early Ottoman rulers as ghazis. Thus in this formulation, the early Ottoman polity was built upon an "ideology of Holy War," and was able to grow powerful by attracting warriors to join in conquering the Christians of Anatolia and the Balkans. The early Ottomans harnessed the religious and martial energies of the frontier (''uc'') between the crumbling Byzantine and Seljuk states in order to conquer an empire.&lt;ref&gt;For this summary of their views, {{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=10–11, 35–41, 48 }} For these authors' works see {{Cite book |last=Wittek |first=Paul |title=The Rise of the Ottoman Empire |date=1938}}; and {{Cite book |last=Köprülü |first=Mehmet Fuat |title=Les origines de l'empire ottoman |place=Paris |date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Wittek's formulation which became generally (though not unanimously) accepted among Western historians of the Ottoman Empire for much of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revisionism==

The fundamental problem with the study of the fourteenth-century Ottomans is the lack of surviving documentation from that time period. Not a single Ottoman authentic written document has been found from the time of [[Osman I]], the first Ottoman ruler.&lt;ref name="Kafadar" /&gt; Historians are thus forced to rely upon sources produced long after the events they purport to describe. Ottoman studies have thus benefited from the techniques of [[literary criticism]], allowing historians to properly analyze Ottoman literary works from later periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=xiii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghaza thesis came under attack from numerous scholars beginning in the 1980s.{{refn|group=nb|Such early critics included G. Káldy-Nagy, R. C. Jennings, Colin Heywood, Colin Imber, Şinasi Tekin, and Feridun Emecen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=166n56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Critics drew attention to the fact that the early Ottomans acted in ways contrary to what one would expect from zealous religious warriors. They were not strictly orthodox Muslims, but rather tolerated many heterodox and [[syncretic]] beliefs and practices. They also willingly recruited Byzantines into their ranks and fought wars against other Muslims. Thus rather than describing reality, later Ottoman writers who characterized their ancestors as ghazis were "adorning [them] with higher ideals," when in fact their original motivations had been much more mundane. For Ottomans writing in the fifteenth century, presenting the earlier Ottoman rulers as ghazis served their political objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=11–2, 49–51 |quote=The main thrust of the critique was to underline certain actions of the early Ottomans that were now deemed contradictory to the spirit of holy war and to argue therefore that they cannot have been motivated by the ghazi ethos. [...] Rather, the critics of the ghaza thesis argue, what once were plain political and/or material motives were adorned with higher ideals in later sources written by ideologues serving the Ottoman dynasty (p. 49-50). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |date=2003 |page=9–11 |quote=In 1984, Pal Fodor, a Hungarian Turcologist, opened a fresh page in the debate with an important article in which he convincingly demonstrated that the ideas of ''ghaza'' and ''ghazi'' in the work of Ahmedi (Wittek's most important source), were a literary device, whereby "Ahmedi presents the Ottoman rulers as ''ghazis'' in a manner that served well-definable political objectives."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In emphasizing the mythical and legendary quality of the stories presented by Ottoman writers, the historian Colin Imber has even gone so far as to declare the entire period a "black hole," the truth about which can never truly be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Imber |first=Colin |editor=Elizabeth Zachariadou |title=The Ottoman Emirate (1300–1389) |chapter=The Legend of Osman Gazi |page=75 |date=1991 |publisher=Crete University Press |place=Rethymnon |quote=Almost all the traditional tales about Osman Ghazi are fictitious. The best thing a modern historian can do is to admit frankly that the earliest history of the Ottomans is a black hole. Any attempt to fill this hole will result simply in more fables. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ottomans as a tribal group===

While many scholars criticized the Ghaza thesis, few sought an alternative to replace it. Rudi Paul Lindner was the first to try in his 1983 publication ''Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia'', in which he argued that the peculiarities of early Ottoman activity could best be explained through tribalism. Lindner saw tribalism through the lens of [[anthropology]], which views tribes as organizations based not on shared bloodlines, but on shared political interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner |first=Rudi P. |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |place=Bloomington |date=1983 |pages=vii–viii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Ottoman raids against the Byzantines were motivated not by religious zeal, but by the nomadic tribe's need to engage in predation against settled society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner |first=Rudi P. |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |place=Bloomington |date=1983 |pages=23–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans were able to incorporate Byzantines and fight against Muslims because their organization was fundamentally tribal, which allowed them to assimilate individuals and groups of diverse backgrounds. Citing various instances of their heterodoxy, Lindner even suggested that the early Ottomans may have been more Pagan than Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner |first=Rudi P. |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |place=Bloomington |date=1983 |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lindner's view, this tribal inclusiveness began to break down during the reign of Osman's son [[Orhan]] (r. 1323/4-1362), as the Ottomans began to shift from being nomadic pastoralists into settled agricultural society. Orhan subsequently attracted Islamic scholars to his realm, who brought with them ideas about ''ghaza'', and it was from them that he adopted the ''ghaza'' ideology in time for it to appear in his 1337 inscription in Bursa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner |first=Rudi P. |title=Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia |publisher=Indiana University Press |place=Bloomington |date=1983 |pages=29–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghaza as one of many factors===
In his 1995 book ''Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State'', Turkish scholar [[Cemal Kafadar]] addressed criticism of the Ghaza thesis by arguing that previous scholars had drawn too great a distinction between "orthodox" and "heterodox" Islam – one could consider oneself a legitimate Muslim without conforming exactly to a scholarly orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=50–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kafadar argued that the early Ottomans' very idea of ''ghaza'' may have differed from that of "orthodox" Islam. Citing contemporary Anatolian legends, he noted that the same figure could be portrayed as a ''ghazi'' while still cooperating with Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=70–5 |quote=My intention here is not to provide more evidence of cooperation between Anatolian Muslim warriors and Byzantines, the prevalence of which is beyond doubt. The point is rather to show that the literature produced by or among the ghazis to glorify their deeds did not find it contradictory to present their ghazi protagonists in cooperation with Christians.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kafadar's view, ''ghaza'' was a real ideology which gave shape to frontier warriors as a social class, not simply an import from Muslim scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=109–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms ''ghaza'' and ''ghazi'' had a range of different meanings which shifted over time, sometimes referring to religiously motivated warriors and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=91 |quote=It would thus seem inappropriate to conceptualize ghaza by assuming, like Wittek and his critics, that it was one and the same notion of "war for the faith" from its earliest emergence to the end of the empire. Another way of looking at it would be to observe that the concept of ghaza underwent transformation in Ottoman thought.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nevertheless ever present, and served as simply one out of many motivating forces behind Ottoman expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State |date=1995 |page=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghaza as a non-religious term===
Following Kafadar, the next major reformulation of the theory of Ottoman origins was carried out by [[Heath Lowry]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Imber |first=Colin |title=Review of Heath Lowry's ''The Nature of the Early Ottoman State'' |journal=The Turkish Studies Association Journal |volume=27 |date=2003 |page=108 |quote=Heath Lowry's ''The Nature of the Early Ottoman State'' is the latest in a series of works that have appeared since the 1920s, attempting to explain the origins of the Ottoman Empire and its subsequent rise to power.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowry attacked Wittek's sources, arguing that Ahmedi's literary work cannot be interpreted as factual history, but rather was a fictionalized idealization of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |place=Albany |date=2003 |pages=15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lowry, the terms ''ghaza'' and ''ghazi'' when used in the fourteenth and fifteenth-century Ottoman context had entirely non-religious meanings, as ''ghaza'' was interchangeable with the term ''akın'', simply referring to a military raid. Many ''[[akıncı]]s'' (raiders) were also Christians, and would thus be very out of place in an army devoted to Islamic holy war. Ottoman warriors were thus motivated by the desire to win plunder and slaves, not to fight in the name of Islam. It was only certain writers, educated in the Islamic tradition, who tried to draw a connection between the secular ''ghaza'' of the frontier warriors and the religious ''ghaza'' as understood by Muslim intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |place=Albany |date=2003 |pages=45–7, 51–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New consensus==

While they differ in many particulars, these new perspectives on early Ottoman history share in the belief that early Ottoman expansion was not primarily fueled by an ideology of Islamic holy war. Historians now generally regard ''ghaza'' as having been "a much more fluid undertaking, sometimes referring to actions that were nothing more than raids, sometimes meaning a deliberate holy war, but most often combining a mixture of these elements."&lt;ref name=ghaza&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Ghaza (gaza) |date=2009 |page=231 |quote=The early Ottoman military activity described as ''ghaza'' is now thought to have been a much more fluid undertaking, sometimes referring to actions that were nothing more than raids, sometimes meaning a deliberate holy war, but most often combining a mixture of these elements. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view also appears in Caroline Finkel's 2005 scholarly survey of Ottoman history, ''Osman's Dream''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Finkel |first=Caroline |title=Osman's Dream: The Story of the Ottoman Empire, 1300–1923 |page=10 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02396-7|date=2006-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Information Age''' (also known as the '''Computer Age''', '''Digital Age''', or '''New Media Age''') is a [[history of the world|historic period]] in the [[21st century]] characterized by the rapid shift from traditional industry that the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought through industrialization, to an economy based on [[information technology]]. The onset of the Information Age is associated with the [[Digital Revolution]], just as the Industrial Revolution marked the onset of the Industrial Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43092627|title=The information age : economy, society and culture|last=Manuel.|first=Castells,|date=1996|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631215948|location=Oxford|oclc=43092627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of what digital means (or what information means) continues to change over time as new technologies, user devices, methods of interaction with other humans and devices enter the domain of research, development and market launch.

During the Information Age, the phenomenon is that the digital industry creates a knowledge-based society surrounded by a high-tech global economy that spans over its influence on how the manufacturing and service sectors operate in an efficient and convenient way.  In a commercialized society, the information industry is able to allow individuals to explore their personalized needs, therefore simplifying the procedure of making decisions for transactions and significantly lowering costs for both the producers and buyers.  This is accepted overwhelmingly by participants throughout the entire economic activities for [[wikt:efficacy|efficacy]] purposes, and new economic incentives would then be indigenously encouraged, such as the [[knowledge economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/146804/files/InformationSchool.pdf "Technology and Workforce: Comparison between the Information Revolution and the Industrial Revolution"] by Mathias Humbert, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;

The Information Age formed by capitalizing on [[Miniaturization|computer microminiaturization]] advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kluver|first=Randy|title=Globalization, Informatization, and Intercultural Communication|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan002006.htm|publisher=[[United Nations Public Administration Network]]|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution of technology in daily life and social organization has led to the fact that the modernization of information and communication processes have become the driving force of social evolution.&lt;ref name="HilbertDT&amp;SC"&gt;Hilbert, M.

==Progression==
[[File:Rings of time Information Age (Digital Revolution).jpg|thumb|Rings of time showing some important dates in Information Age ([[Digital Revolution]]) from 1968 to 2017]]
===Library expansion===
Library expansion was calculated in 1945 by [[Fremont Rider]] to double in capacity every 16 years, if sufficient space were made available.&lt;ref name="The Scholar"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rider| title = The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library| publisher = Hadham Press| date = 1944| location = New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated replacing bulky, decaying printed works with miniaturized [[microform]] analog photographs, which could be duplicated on-demand for library patrons or other institutions. He did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media. Automated, potentially lossless digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of information growth. [[Moore's law]], which was formulated around 1965, calculated that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.&lt;ref name="news.cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-984051.html |title=Moore's Law to roll on for another decade |quote=Moore also affirmed he never said transistor count would double every 18 months, as is commonly said. Initially, he said transistors on a chip would double every year. He then recalibrated it to every two years in 1975. David House, an Intel executive at the time, noted that the changes would cause computer performance to double every 18 months. |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of the smaller and less expensive personal computers and improvements in computing power by the early 1980s resulted in a sudden access to and ability to share and store information for increasing numbers of workers.  Connectivity between computers within companies led to the ability of workers at different levels to access greater amounts of information.

===Information storage===
The world's technological capacity  to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986 to 15.8 in 1993, over 54.5 in 2000, and to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), roughly 4 CD-ROM per person of 1993, 12 CD-ROM per person in the year 2000, and almost 61 CD-ROM per person in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|last2=López|first2=Priscila|year=2011|title=The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60|journal=Science|language=en|volume=332|issue=6025|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.1200970|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21310967|via=|bibcode=2011Sci...332...60H}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the world's capacity to store information has reached 5 [[zettabytes]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillings|first=Michael R.|last2=Hilbert|first2=Martin|last3=Kemp|first3=Darrell J.|year=2016|title=Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/38f4b791|journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]]|volume=31|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013|via=}} &lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 4,500 stacks of printed books from the [[earth]] to the [[sun]].

===Information transmission===
The world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 715 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1993, 1.2 (optimally compressed) [[zettabytes]] in 2000, and 1.9 zettabytes in 2007 (this is the information equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day).&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; The world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007 (this is the information equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day).&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; In the 1990s,  the spread of the Internet caused a sudden leap in access to and ability to share information in businesses and homes globally. Technology was developing so quickly that a computer costing $3000 in 1997 would cost $2000 two years later and $1000 the following year.

===Computation===
The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[Million instructions per second|MIPS]] in 1986, to 4.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS in 1993, 2.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS in 2000 to 6.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; An article in the recognized Journal [[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] reports that by now digital technology "has vastly exceeded the cognitive capacity of any single human being and has done so a decade earlier than predicted. In terms of capacity, there are two measures of importance: the number of operations a system can perform and the amount of information that can be stored. The number of synaptic operations per second in a human brain has been estimated to lie between 10^15 and 10^17. While this number is impressive, even in 2007 humanity's general-purpose computers were capable of performing well over 10^18 instructions per second. Estimates suggest that the storage capacity of an individual human brain is about 10^12 bytes. On a per capita basis, this is matched by current digital storage (5x10^21 bytes per 7.2x10^9 people)".&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016" /&gt;

==Relation to economics==
Eventually, [[Information and Communication Technology]]—computers, computerized machinery, [[fiber optic communication|fiber optics]], communication satellites, internet, and other ICT tools—became a significant part of the economy. Microcomputers were developed and many businesses and industries were greatly changed by ICT.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

[[Nicholas Negroponte]] captured the essence of these changes in his 1995 book, ''[[Being Digital]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/nn/bdcont.htm |title=Negroponte's articles |publisher=Archives.obs-us.com |date=1996-12-30 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book discusses similarities and differences between products made of atoms and products made of bits. In essence, a copy of a product made of bits can be made cheaply and quickly, and shipped across the country or internationally quickly and at very low cost.

===Impact on jobs and income distribution===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}

The Information Age has affected the workforce in several ways. It has created a situation in which workers who perform easily automated tasks are forced to find work that is not easily automated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Michael|title=How Information Gives You Competitive Advantage|url=https://hbr.org/1985/07/how-information-gives-you-competitive-advantage|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Workers are also being forced to compete in a global [[job market]]. Lastly, workers are being replaced by computers that can do their jobs faster and more effectively. This poses problems for workers in industrial societies, which are still to be solved. However, solutions that involve lowering the [[working time]] are usually highly resisted.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Jobs traditionally associated with the middle class (assembly line workers, data processors, foremen and supervisors) are beginning to disappear, either through outsourcing or [[automation]]. Individuals who lose their jobs must either move up, joining a group of "mind workers" (engineers, doctors, attorneys, teachers, scientists, professors, executives, journalists, consultants), or settle for low-skill, low-wage service jobs.

The "mind workers" are able to compete successfully in the [[world economy|world market]] and receive (relatively) high wages. Conversely, production workers and service workers in industrialized nations are unable to compete with workers in developing countries and either lose their jobs through outsourcing or are forced to accept wage cuts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGowan|first=Robert|year=1991|title=The work of nations: Preparing ourselves for the 21st century capitalism, by Robert Reich. New York: Knopf Publishing, 1991|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.3930300407/abstract|journal=Human Resource Management|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=535–538|doi=10.1002/hrm.3930300407|issn=1099-050X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the internet makes it possible for workers in developing countries to provide in-person services and compete directly with their counterparts in other nations.

This has had several major consequences, including increased opportunity in developing countries and the globalisation of the workforce.

Workers in [[developing countries]] have a [[competitive advantage]] that translates into increased opportunities and higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In defense of Globalization|last=Bhagwati|first=Jagdish N.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The full impact on the workforce in [[developing countries]] is complex and has downsides. (see discussion in section on [[Globalization|Globalisation]]).

In the past, the economic fate of workers was tied to the fate of [[national economies]]. For example, workers in the United States were once well paid in comparison to the workers in other countries. With the advent of the [[Information]] Age and improvements in communication, this is no longer the case.  Because workers are forced to compete in a global [[job market]], wages are less dependent on the success or failure of individual economies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Automation, productivity and job gain===
The Information Age has affected the workforce in that automation and computerisation have resulted in higher productivity coupled with net job loss in manufacture. In the United States for example, from January 1972 to August 2010, the number of people employed in manufacturing jobs fell from 17,500,000 to 11,500,000 while manufacturing value rose 270%.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Manufacturing : Output vs. Jobs, January 1972 to August 2010 ".

[http://www.openmarket.org/2010/10/05/job-losses-and-productivity-gains/ "Job Losses and Productivity Gains"], OpenMarket.org, Oct 05, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it initially appeared that [[job loss]] in the [[industrial sector]] might be partially offset by the rapid growth of jobs in the [[IT sector]], the recession of March 2001 foreshadowed a sharp drop in the number of jobs in the IT sector. This pattern of decrease in jobs continued until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Sandra D. [http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/DE-Chap2.pdf "Information Technology Workers in the Digital Economy"], in Digital Economy 2003.  2003: Economics and Statistics Administration, Department of Commerce.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data has shown that overall, technology creates more jobs than it destroys even in the short run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yongsung|first=Chang|author2=Hong|title=Jay H.|journal=SERI Quarterly|date=July 2013|volume=6|issue=3|pages=44–53|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/89556690/does-technology-create-jobs|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of information-intensive industry===
Industry is becoming more information-intensive and less labor and capital-intensive (see [[Information industry]]). This trend has important implications for the workforce; workers are becoming increasingly productive as the value of their labor decreases. However, there are also important implications for capitalism itself; not only is the value of labor decreased, the value of capital is also diminished. In the classical model, investments in [[human capital]] and [[financial capital]] are important predictors of the performance of a new venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Arnold C.|last2=Gimeno-Gascon|first2=F. Javier|last3=Woo|first3=Carolyn Y.|year=1994|title=Initial human and financial capital as predictors of new venture performance|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883902694900132|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=9|issue=5|pages=371–395|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(94)90013-2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as demonstrated by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and [[Facebook]], it now seems possible for a group of relatively inexperienced people with limited capital to succeed on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/business/media/04carr.html|title=Film Version of Zuckerberg Divides the Generations|last=Carr|first=David|date=2010-10-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations==
The Information Age was enabled by technology developed in the [[Digital Revolution]], which was itself enabled by building on the developments in the [[Technological Revolution]].

===Computers===
{{main|History of computers}}

Before the advent of [[electronics]], [[mechanical computers]], like the [[Analytical Engine]] in 1837, were designed to provide routine mathematical calculation and simple decision-making capabilities. Military needs during [[World War II]] drove development of the first electronic computers, based on [[vacuum tubes]], including the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]], [[Colossus computer]], and [[ENIAC]].

The invention of the [[transistor]] in 1947 enabled the era of [[mainframe computers]] (1950s – 1970s), typified by the [[IBM 360]]. These large, room-sized computers provided data calculation and manipulation that was much faster than humanly possible, but were expensive to buy and maintain, so were initially limited to a few scientific institutions, large corporations, and government agencies. As transistor technology [[Moore's Law|rapidly improved]], the ratio of computing power to size increased dramatically, giving direct access to computers to ever smaller groups of people.

Along with electronic [[arcade machine]]s and [[home video game console]]s in the 1970s, the development of [[personal computer]]s like the [[Commodore PET]] and [[Apple II]] (both in 1977) gave individuals access to the computer. But data sharing between individual computers was either non-existent or largely [[sneaker net|manual]], at first using [[punched card]]s and [[magnetic tape]], and later [[floppy disk]]s.

===Data===
{{main|History of telecommunications}}

The first developments for storing data were initially based on photographs, starting with [[microphotography]] in 1851 and then [[microform]] in the 1920s, with the ability to store documents on film, making them much more compact.  In the 1970s, [[electronic paper]] allowed digital information to appear as paper documents.

Early [[information theory]] and [[Hamming code]]s were developed about 1950, but awaited technical innovations in data transmission and storage to be put to full use. While cables transmitting digital data connected [[computer terminals]] and [[peripheral]]s to mainframes were common, and special message-sharing systems leading to [[email]] were first developed in the 1960s, independent computer-to-computer networking began with [[ARPANET]] in 1969.  This expanded to become the [[Internet]] (coined in 1974), and then the [[World Wide Web]] in 1989.

Public digital data transmission first utilized existing phone lines using [[dial-up]], starting in the 1950s, and this was the mainstay of the Internet until [[broadband]] in the 2000s. The introduction of [[wireless networking]] in the 1990s combined with the proliferation of [[communications satellite]]s in the 2000s allowed for public digital transmission without the need for cables. This technology led to [[digital television]], [[GPS]], and [[satellite radio]] through the 1990s and 2000s.

Computers continued to become smaller and more powerful, to the point where they could be carried.  In the 1980s and 1990s, [[laptop]]s were developed as a form of portable computers, and [[PDA]]s could be used while standing or walking. [[Pager]]s existing since the 1950s, were largely replaced by [[mobile phone]]s beginning in the late 1990s, providing mobile networking features to some computers. Now commonplace, this technology is extended to [[digital camera]]s and other wearable devices. Starting in the late 1990s, [[Tablet computer|tablets]] and then [[smartphone]]s combined and extended these abilities of computing, mobility, and information sharing.

===Optics===
{{main|Optical communication}}

[[Optical communication]] has played an important role in [[communication network]]s.&lt;ref name="millman"&gt;S. Millman (1983), [http://doc.telephonecollectors.info/dm/BTL_History_Physical_Sciences_1983_op_r.pdf#page=34 ''A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System'', page 10], [[AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Optical communication provided the hardware basis for [[internet]] technology, laying the foundations for the [[Digital Revolution]] and Information Age.&lt;ref name="soh"&gt;[http://www.soh-vehe.jp/english/background3.html The Third Industrial Revolution Occurred in Sendai], Soh-VEHE International Patent Office, [[Japan Patent Attorneys Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While working at [[Tohoku University]], Japanese engineer [[Jun-ichi Nishizawa]] proposed [[fiber-optic communication]], the use of [[optical fiber]]s for optical communication, in 1963.&lt;ref name=Bhat&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bhat, K. N. |editor2=DasGupta, Amitava|title = Physics of semiconductor devices|publisher =Narosa Publishing House|year= 2004|location =New Delhi, India|chapter=Terahertz wave generation and light amplification using Raman effect|author1=Nishizawa, Jun-ichi  |author2=Suto, Ken|lastauthoramp=yes |url =https://books.google.com/?id=2NTpSnfhResC&amp;pg=PA27|isbn =81-7319-567-6|page =27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nishizawa invented other technologies that contributed to the development of optical fiber communications, such as the [[Graded-index fiber|graded-index optical fiber]] as a channel for transmitting light from [[semiconductor laser]]s.&lt;ref name="Sendai New"&gt;{{cite web|work=Sendai New |title=Optical Fiber |url=http://www.city.sendai.jp/soumu/kouhou/s-new-e6/page01.html |accessdate=April 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929124200/http://www.city.sendai.jp/soumu/kouhou/s-new-e6/page01.html |archivedate=September 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{cite web |work=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |title=New Medal Honors Japanese Microelectrics Industry Leader |url=http://www.ieee.org/portal/site/tionline/menuitem.130a3558587d56e8fb2275875bac26c8/index.jsp?&amp;pName=institute_level1_article&amp;TheCat=1003&amp;article=tionline/legacy/inst2003/jun03/6w.nishizawa.xml&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He patented the graded-index optical fiber in 1964.&lt;ref name="soh"/&gt; The [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state]] optical fiber was invented by Nishizawa in 1964.&lt;ref name="ohmsha"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2DEEAQAAIAAJ ''Semiconductor Technologies''], page 338, Ohmsha, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The three essential elements of optical communication were invented by Jun-ichi Nishizawa: the [[semiconductor laser]] (1957) being the light source, the graded-index optical fiber (1964) as the transmission line, and the [[PIN photodiode]] (1950) as the optical receiver.&lt;ref name="soh"/&gt; [[Izuo Hayashi]]'s invention of the [[continuous wave]] semiconductor laser in 1970 led directly to the light sources in fiber-optic communication, [[laser printer]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, and [[optical disc drive]]s, commercialized by Japanese entrepreneurs,&lt;ref name=burning&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnstone|first=Bob|title=We were burning : Japanese entrepreneurs and the forging of the electronic age.|year=2000|publisher=BasicBooks|location=New York|isbn=9780465091188|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opening up the field of optical communications.&lt;ref name="millman"/&gt;

(This article lists some of the '''states''', '''empires''', or '''dynasties''' that were ruled by a Muslim elite, or which were in some way central to or a part of a Muslim empire.)   

All the disparate Islamic Empires can all be traced back to Muhammad, as the founder not only of the Islamic faith but also the first leader of the Muslim people.   

Scholars debate what exactly constitutes an [[empire]]. One definition defines an empire as a [[Sovereign state|state]] that extends [[dominion]] over areas and populations [[culturally]] and [[ethnically]] distinct  from the culture/ethnicity at the center of power.  

== History of Muslim states==
The [[early Muslim conquests]] began in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. His successors conquered large swaths of the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to parts of [[southern Europe]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the decades after his death.  The [[caliphate]] founded by his earliest successors, called the [[Rashidun caliphate]], was succeeded by the [[Umayyad caliphate]] and later the [[Abbasid caliphate]].

While the caliphates gradually fractured and fell, other Muslim dynasties rose; some of these dynasties grew into "Islamic empires", with some of the most notable being the Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires.

== Caliphates ==

This is a '''list of [[circumnavigation]]s''' of the [[planet]] [[Earth]]. Sections are ordered by ascending date of completion of voyage.

==Global circumnavigations==

===Seacraft===
&lt;!-- NOTE: Not all of these may be "ships"--&gt;

====16th century====
* The 18 survivors, led by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|Castilian ('Spanish') expedition]] (which began with 5 ships and 270 men); 1519–1522; westward from Spain; in ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]''. After Magellan was killed by people of the [[Philippines]] Lapu-Lapu on 27 April 1521, the circumnavigation was completed under the command of the Basque Spanish seafarer [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] who returned to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Spain, on 6 September 1522, after a journey of 3 years and 1 month.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky, Mark. 1999. ''The Basque History of the World''. Walker &amp; Company, New York. {{ISBN|0-8027-1349-1}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; These men were the '''first to circumnavigate the globe in a single expedition'''.
* The survivors of [[García Jofre de Loaísa]]'s Spanish expedition 1525–1536 including [[Andrés de Urdaneta]]; westward from Spain. None of Loaísa's seven ships completed the voyage, but ''Santa María de la Victoria'' reached the [[Moluccas]] before being wrecked in a Portuguese attack. Successive chiefs of the expedition (Loaísa, Elcano, Salazar, Iñiguez, De la Torre) died during the voyages. [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] and other fellow men survived, reaching the [[Spice Islands]] in 1526, to be taken prisoner by the Portuguese. Urdaneta and a few of his men returned to Spain in 1536 aboard Portuguese ships via [[Portuguese India|India]], the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and Portugal, and completed the second world circumnavigation in history.
* [[Francis Drake]]; 1577–1580; westward from England; in ''[[Golden Hind]]''; discovered the [[Drake Passage]] but entered the Pacific via the [[Strait of Magellan]]; '''first English circumnavigation''' and the second carried out in a single expedition. Drake was the first to complete a circumnavigation as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire circumnavigation.
* [[Martín Ignacio de Loyola]]; 1580–1584; westward from Spain.
* [[Thomas Cavendish]]; 1586–1588; westward from England; in ''[[Desire (ship)|Desire]]''.
* [[Martín Ignacio de Loyola]]; 1585–1589; eastward from Spain (via Macau, China, and Acapulco, Mexico); '''First person to circumnavigate the world twice''', first one to circumnavigate '''eastwards''' and both westwards and eastwards (1580–1584 westward and 1585–1589 eastward), and first to use overland routes in his circumnavigation.
* [[João da Gama]]; 1584 (or 1585)–1590; eastward from Portugal; from Lisbon to India, Malacca, Macau (China) and Japan. Gama crossed the Pacific at a higher northern latitude; was taken prisoner in Mexico and carried in Spanish ships to the Iberian Peninsula. One of the first to do eastwards, mostly by sea.

====17th century====
* The survivors of the expedition of [[Jacques Mahu]]; 1598–1601; westward from Holland; Of Mahu's five ships only two returned.
* The survivors of the expedition of [[Olivier van Noort]]; 1598–1601; westward from Holland; Of Van Noort's four ships only two returned.
* [[Francesco Carletti]]; Florentine merchant; 1594–1602; westward from Italy; travelled across the American continent overland, through Panama. All Carletti's other travel was by sea until he ended in the Netherlands; he travelled from there overland back to Italy. Carletti was perhaps the first to travel all legs as a passenger, not as a ship's officer or a crew member. Carletti described his journey in his autobiography, "My Voyage Around the World", translated into various languages.
* [[Joris van Spilbergen]]; 1614–1617; westward from Holland.
* [[Willem Schouten]] and [[Jacob Le Maire]]; 1615–1617; westward from Holland; in ''Eendraght''; Discovered [[Cape Horn]] and the '''first expedition to enter the Pacific via the [[Drake Passage]]'''.
* [[Jacques l'Hermite]] and [[John Hugo Schapenham]]; 1623–1626; westward from Holland.
* [[Pedro Cubero]]; 1670–1679; eastward from Spain; the '''first maritime circumnavigation including significant travel overland'''.
* [[William Dampier]] (English); 1679–1691; westward from England.
* [[Gemelli Careri|Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri]]; 1693–1698; eastward from Naples; the '''first [[tourist]] to circumnavigate the globe, paying his own way on multiple voyages''', crossing Mexico on land.

====18th century====
* [[William Funnell (sailor)|William Funnell]] (English); 1703–1706.&lt;ref name="Robert Kerr Gutenberg"&gt;{{Gutenberg|no=13130 |name=A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Dampier]] (English); 1703–1706.&lt;ref name="Robert Kerr Gutenberg" /&gt;
* [[Woodes Rogers]] (English); 1708–1711; with the ''Duke'' and the ''Duchess''; He rescued [[Alexander Selkirk]] on Juan Fernandez on 31 January 1709. Selkirk had been stranded there for four years.
* [[William Dampier]] (English); 1708–1711; '''First person to circumnavigate the world three times''' (1679–1691, 1703–1707 and 1708–1711).

A '''logarithmic timeline''' is a timeline laid out according to a [[logarithmic scale]].  This necessarily implies a [[wikt:zero-point|zero point]] and an [[infinity point]], neither of which can be displayed. The most natural zero point is the [[Big Bang]], looking forward, but the most common is the ever-changing present, looking backward. (Also possible is a zero point in the present, looking forward to the infinite future.)

The idea of presenting history logarithmically goes back at least to 1932, when [[John B. Sparks]] copyrighted his chart "Histomap of Evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/08/12/the_1931_histomap_the_entire_history_of_the_world_distilled_into_a_single.html?wpisrc=obnetwork

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time it was also explored by the [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]] [[Heinz von Foerster]], who used it to propose that memories naturally fade in an exponential manner. Logarithmic timelines have also been used in [[future studies]] to justify the idea of a [[technological singularity]].

A logarithmic scale enables events throughout time to be presented accurately, but enables more events to be included closer to one end. Sparks explained this by stating:
: ''As we travel forward in geological time the more complex is the evolution of life forms and the more are the changes to be recorded. Further, the most recent periods of evolution hold the most interest for us. We need therefore increasingly more space for our outline the nearer we approach modern times, and the logarithmic scale fulfills just this condition without any break in the continuity.''

Two examples of such timelines are shown below, while a more comprehensive version (similar to that of Sparks' "Histomap") can be found at [[Detailed logarithmic timeline]].

== Example of a forward-looking logarithmic timeline ==

In this table each row is defined in seconds after the [[Big Bang]], with earliest at the top of the chart. (see [[Cosmological decade]])

|}

The present time is approximately {{val|4.3|e=17}} seconds after the Big Bang; the Sun and Earth formed about {{val|2|e=17}} seconds after the Big Bang. 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; seconds is 3&amp;nbsp;trillion years ({{val|3|e=12}} years) in the future.

== Example of a backward-looking logarithmic timeline ==

In this table each row is defined in ''years ago'', that is, years before the present [[calendar date|date]], with the most recent at the top of the chart. Each event is an occurrence of an observed or inferred process.  (Note that the logarithmic scale never actually gets to zero.)

The '''long 19th century''' is a term coined for the period between the years 1789 and 1914 by Russian literary critic and author [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/long-centuries/ |title=Long Centuries |publisher=the-tls.co.uk |date= April 29, 2011  |author= Gasan Gusejnov |accessdate= December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian and author [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The concept is an adaption of [[Fernand Braudel]]'s 1949 notion of ''le long seizième siècle'' ("the long 16th century" 1450–1640).&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. (1972). The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II

Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848]]'' (1962), ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875]]'' (1975), and ''[[The Age of Empire: 1875–1914]]'' (1987). Hobsbawn starts his long 19th century with the [[French Revolution]], which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the [[outbreak of World War I]], upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring [[European balance of power|European power balance]] of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.  In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, ''[[The Age of Extremes|The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991]]'' (1994), Hobsbawm details [[Short twentieth century|the short 20th century]] beginning with [[World War I]] and ending with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]].

A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by [[Peter N. Stearns]] in the context of the [[world history]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|title=World Civilizations: The Global Experience|year=2011|publisher=[[Longman]]|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-136020-4|edition=6th|author2=Michael Adas|author3=Stuart B. Schwartz|author4=Marc Jason Gilbert|authorlink=Peter Stearns|authorlink2=Michael Adas|authorlink3=Stuart B. Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the [[history of the Catholic Church]], the long 19th century was a period of centralization of [[Papacy|papal]] power over the [[Catholic Church]]. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals.  The church's long 19th century extended from the [[French Revolution#Revolution and the Church|French Revolution]] (1789) until the death of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Malley | first = John W. | author-link = John W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10470">'''National memory''' is a form of [[collective memory]] defined by shared experiences and culture. It is an integral part to [[national identity]].

It represents one specific form of [[cultural memory]], which makes an essential contribution to national [[group cohesion]]. Historically national communities have drawn upon commemorative ceremonies and monuments, [[myth]]s and rituals, glorified individuals, objects, and events in their own history to produce a common narrative&lt;!--worldview, conception--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory, History, and Colonialism|url=https://www.ghil.ac.uk/fileadmin/redaktion/dokumente/bulletin/GHIL%20Bulletin%20Supplement%201%20(2009).pdf|publisher=German Historical Institute London|accessdate=3 March 2017|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lorraine Ryan, national memory is based on the public's reception of national historic narratives and the ability of people to affirm the legitimacy of these narratives.
&lt;!--'''National remembrance''' ...--&gt;

==Conflicting versions, dynamicity, manipulation and subjectivity==
National memory typically consists of a shared interpretation of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=prague&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paces|first1=Cynthia|title=Prague Panoramas: National Memory and Sacred Space in the Twentieth Century|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=9780822977674|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ZztTm-zrjIYC|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interpretations can vary and sometimes compete.&lt;ref name=prague/&gt; They can get challenged and augmented by a range of interest groups, fighting to have their histories acknowledged, documented and commemorated and reshape national stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weedon|first1=Chris|last2=Jordan|first2=Glenn|title=Collective memory: theory and politics|journal=Social Semiotics|date=April 2012|volume=22|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1080/10350330.2012.664969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often national memory is adjusted to offer a politicized vision of the past to make a political position appear consistent with national identity.&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Samuel J.|title=Twice-divided Nation: The Civil War and National Memory in the Transatlantic World|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109024135|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=S7oq4-MZcr4C|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it profoundly affects how historical facts are perceived and recorded and may circumvent or appropriate facts.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt; A repertoire of discursive strategies functions to emotionalize national narrative and nationalize personal pasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Geoffrey M.|title=Emotional Remembering: The Pragmatics of National Memory|journal=Ethos|date=December 1999|volume=27|issue=4|pages=505–529|doi=10.1525/eth.1999.27.4.505|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229796645_Emotional_Remembering_The_Pragmatics_of_National_Memory|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National memory has been used calculatedly by governments for dynastic, political, religious and cultural purposes since as early as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillis|first1=John R.|title=Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691029253|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WAB4sd2nFyMC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing of memory by the [[culture industry]] and its instrumentalisation for political purposes can both be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;

Lorraine Ryan notes that individual memory both shapes and is shaped by national memory, and that there is a competition between the dominant and individual memories of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lorraine|title=Cosmopolitan memory and national memory conflicts: On the dynamics of their interaction|journal=Journal of Sociology|date=28 November 2012|volume=50|issue=4|pages=501–514|doi=10.1177/1440783312467097|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyung Park states that the nation is continuously revived, re-imagined, reconstituted, through shared memories among its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Hyung yu|title=Shared national memory as intangible heritage|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=April 2011|volume=38|issue=2|pages=520–539|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2010.11.013|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256987216_Shared_national_memory_as_intangible_heritage_Re-imagining_Two_Koreas_as_One_Nation|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National memories may also conflict&lt;!--/collide--&gt; with the other nations' collective memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomian|first1=Krzysztof|title=Divided memory: European sites of memory as political and cultural phenomenon|url=http://www.enrs.eu/pl/articles/219-divided-memory|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=pl-pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the media==
Reports that are narrated&lt;!--/written--&gt; in terms of national memory characterize the past in ways that merge the past, the present and the future into "a single ongoing tale".&lt;ref name="medmem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garde-Hansen|first1=Joanne|title=Media and Memory|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748688883|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xdpvAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Nora]] argues that a "democratisation of history" allows for emancipatory versions of the past to surface:&lt;ref name=ww2.0&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruyn|first1=Dieter De|title=World War 2.0: Commemorating War and Holocaust in Poland through Facebook|issn=2043-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|National memory cannot come into being until the historical framework of the nation has been shattered. It reflects the abandonment of the traditional channels and modes of transmission of the past and the desacralisation of such primary sites of initiation as the school, the family, the museum, and the monument: what was once the responsibility of these institutions has now flowed over into the public domain and been taken over by the media and tourist industry|source=Nora 1998, 363&lt;ref name="medmem"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;}}
&lt;!--More: &lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;--&gt;

However, national history being passed on by the culture industry, such as by [[historical films]], can be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;

===International media===
{{See also|Global news flow|Category:Cultural exchange|International communication}}
Nations' memories can be shared across nations via media such as the [[Internet]]&lt;!-- and thereby help globalize national memories--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ANDREWS|first1=MAGGIE|last2=BAGOT-JEWITT|first2=CHARLIE|last3=HUNT|first3=NIGEL|title=Introduction: National memory and war|journal=Journal of War &amp; Culture Studies|date=8 December 2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=283–288|doi=10.1386/jwcs.4.3.283_7|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269606175_Introduction_National_memory_and_war|language=en|issn=1752-6272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects and functions ==
National memory can be a force of cohesion as well as division and conflict. It can foster constructive national reforms, international communities and agreements,&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt; dialogue as well as deepen problematic courses and rhetoric.

[[Identity crisis]] can occur due to bad memories (such as national crimes)&lt;!--cn--&gt; or the absence of a belief in a shared past.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Often new developments, processes, problems and events are [[Sensemaking|made sense of]] and contextualized by drawing from national memory.

== Critical national memory ==
Critical history or historic memory cuts from national memory's tradition centric to national heritage and orients itself towards a specialized study of history in a more [[sociological]] [[Historical sociology|manner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koshar|first1=Rudy J.|title=Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and National Memory in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807862629|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=yVzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that the unthinkable ought not to be unmasked but that instead what made it thinkable should be reconstructed and that the difficulty of discussing the non-places or the bad places of national memory make it necessary to include forgetfulness and amnesia in the concept.&lt;ref name=places&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montaño|first1=Eugenia Allier|title=Places of memory. Is the concept applicable to the analysis of memorial struggles? The case of Uruguay and its recent past|url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/pdf/s_cclaeh/v4nse/scs_a01.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

National memory may lead to questioning the nation as it is as well as its identity and imply a societal negotiation of what the country wishes to be as a nation. To understand the links between memory, forgetfulness, identity and the imaginary construction of the nation analysis of the discourse in the places of memory is fundamental as in all writings of national history an image of the nation is being restructured.&lt;ref name=places/&gt;

The '''New Chronology''' is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical theory]] which argues that the conventional [[chronology]] of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] actually occurred during the [[Middle Ages]], more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Nikolai Morozov]] (1854–1946),&lt;ref name="billington83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |pages=83 |quote=The radical revisionism of Nosovsky and Fomenko's ''New Chronology of Rus'' has its origins in the attempt by Nicholai Morozov to synthesize science and history during twenty-five years in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work by French scholar [[Jean Hardouin]] (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colavito|2004}} "Today an intellectual successor to Hardouin claims that it is not classical antiquity that was forged, but instead the history of the Middle Ages. Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko has devised a system he calls the 'New Chronology'..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician [[Anatoly Fomenko]] (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in ''History: Fiction or Science?'', originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]].

The New Chronology also contains ''a reconstruction'', an alternative chronology, radically shorter than the standard historical timeline, because all ancient history is "folded" onto the Middle Ages. According to Fomenko's claims, the [[recorded history|written history]] of humankind goes only as far back as [[Anno Domini|AD]] 800, there is almost no information about events between AD 800–1000, and most known historical events took place in AD 1000–1500.

The New Chronology is rejected by mainstream [[historian]]s and is inconsistent with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating]] techniques used in the wider [[academia|scholarly community]]. The majority of scientific commentators consider The New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="prezRAS1999"&gt;[http://rc.nsu.ru/text/news/Physics/057.html Проблемы борьбы с лженаукой (обсуждение в Президиуме РАН)] — {{Interlanguage link multi|Вестник Российской академии наук|ru}} 1999, том&amp;nbsp;69, №&amp;nbsp;10, с.&amp;nbsp;879—904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prezRAS2003"&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/VRAN/2004/FALSCI.HTM Чем угрожает обществу лженаука?

==History of New Chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the early 17th century. [[Jean Hardouin]] then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by [[Benedictine]] monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks' reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diacu | first = Florin

In 1887, [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] expressed the opinion that [[early Christianity|early Christian history]] was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | last = Johnson | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Johnson (historian) | title = Antiqua Mater | chapter = Preface | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 [[Otto Rank]] made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities—in short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rank | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Rank

Fomenko became interested in Morozov's theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of [[Moscow State University]], he published several articles on "new mathematical methods in history" in peer-reviewed journals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to "a brief period of renown"; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal ''Questions of History'' complained, "Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science."&lt;ref name="beam"&gt;{{cite news|title=A shorter history of civilization|last=Beam|first=Alex|date=1991-09-16|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nosovsky G. V., Fomenko A. T., "Empire. Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, Egypt. New mathematical chronology of ancient times / Носовский Г. В., Фоменко А. Т. Империя. Русь, Турция, Китай, Европа, Египет. Новая математическая хронология древности." (in Russian), 1996, with at least 6 later editions — М.: Факториал, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fomenko's claims==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}
Central to Fomenko's New Chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, which he called the "Russian Horde", which he says played the dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the [[Scythians]], [[Huns]], [[Goths]] and [[Bulgars]], through the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyane]], [[Dulebes|Duleby]], [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]], [[Pechenegs]], to in more recent times, the [[Cossacks]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]], are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde. For the New Chronologists, peoples such as the Ukrainians, Belarusians, [[Mongols#Russia|Mongols]], and others who assert their national independence from Russia, are suffering from a historical delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) pp. 5, 8, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in 'biographies' of many real and imaginary persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.
 | script-title=ru:Царь Славян | language = Russian
 | publisher = СПб.: Нева | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical [[Jesus]] is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet [[Elisha]] (850–800 BC?), [[Pope Gregory VII]] (1020?–1085), Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] (330–379), and even [[Li Yuanhao]] (also known as Emperor Jingzong or "Son of Heaven" - emperor of [[Western Xia]], who reigned in 1032–48), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the [[Joshua's Hill]], overlooking the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = А.Т.Фоменко | author2 = Г.В.Носовский | title = Датировка Рождества Христова серединой XII века | language = Russian | url = http://chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | format = download | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413014454/http://www.chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | archivedate = 2008-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into "New Rome" = Gospel [[Jerusalem]] (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = [[Troy]] = [[Yoros Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.

 | publisher = М.: Астрель, АСТ | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of [[Yoros Castle]] is [[Joshua's Hill]] which Fomenko alleges is the hill [[Calvary]] depicted in the Bible.

Fomenko claims the [[Hagia Sophia]] is actually the biblical [[Temple of Solomon]]. He identifies Solomon as sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494–1566).

On the other hand, according to Fomenko the word "Rome" is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the "First Rome" or "Ancient Rome" or "Mizraim" is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the [[Nile]] with its capital in [[Alexandria]]. The second and most famous "New Rome" is Constantinople. The third "Rome" is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by [[Aeneas]] and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great "Russian Horde".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Specific claims===
{{cleanup list|date=May 2015}}
In volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of ''History: Fiction or Science?'', Fomenko and his colleagues make numerous claims:
* Historians and translators often "assign" different dates and locations to different accounts of the same historical events, creating multiple "phantom copies" of these events. These "phantom copies" are often misdated by centuries or even millennia and end up incorporated into conventional chronology.
* This chronology was largely manufactured by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in ''Opus Novum de emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurum temporum'' (1606), and represents a vast array of dates produced without any justification whatsoever, containing the repeating sequences of dates with shifts equal to multiples of the major cabbalistic numbers 333 and 360. The [[Jesuit]] [[Denis Pétau|Dionysius Petavius]] completed this chronology in ''De Doctrina Temporum'', 1627 (v.1) and 1632 (v.2).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One might wonder why we should want to revise the chronology of ancient history today and base our revision on new empirical-statistical methods. It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century chronology was considered to be a subdivision of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chronology | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* 37 complete Egyptian [[horoscope]]s found in Denderah, Esna, and other temples have unique valid astronomical solutions with dates ranging from AD 1000 and up to as late as AD 1700. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Egyptian astronomical symbols once applied to horoscopes from temples allows for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is sufficient for unique dating. There are symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation and the symbols do not change from one temple horoscope to another. The horoscopes from temples contain data about eclipses visible in Egypt allowing their exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = Astronomy Vs History | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The [[Book of Revelation]], as we know it, contains a horoscope, dated to 25 September - 10 October 1486, compiled by cabbalist [[Johannes Reuchlin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As we have already noted, the inability of the latter day commentators to comprehend the astronomical symbolism of the Apocalypse is directly resulting from the loss of knowledge about the correct chronology and the distortions introduced by historians of the XVI-XVIII century. Another possibility is that there was an unspoken general taboo on what concerned a subject quite as dangerous, which resulted in the misdating of the Apocalypse. One way or another, the understanding of the astronomical descriptions that the Apocalypse contains got lost at some point. The Apocalypse had lost its distinctive astronomical hue in the eyes of the readers. However, its “astronomical component” is not simply exceptionally important – it alone suffices for the dating of the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Apocalypse as seen by Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The horoscopes found in Sumerian/Babylonian tablets do not contain sufficient astronomical data; consequently, they have solutions every 30–50 years on the time axis and are therefore useless for purposes of dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Babylonian astronomical symbols once applied to clay tablets don't allow for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is not sufficient for unique dating. Either there not enough symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation or  the symbols change from one clay tablet to another. The clay tablets contain data about eclipses visible in Babylon  that could have taken place  every 30-40 years, therefore don’t allow there exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The Chinese tables of eclipses are useless for dating, as they contain too many eclipses that did not take place astronomically. Chinese tables of comets, even if true, cannot be used for dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese eclipse observations can neither confirm nor refute any chronology of China at all, be it veracious or erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chinese Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fomenko's methods==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}

===Statistical correlation of texts===
One of Fomenko's simplest methods is statistical [[correlation]] of texts. His basic assumption is that a text which describes a sequence of events will devote more space to more important events (for example, a period of [[war]] or an [[unrest]] will have much more space devoted to than a period of [[peace]]ful, non-eventful years), and that this irregularity will remain visible in other descriptions of the period. For each analysed text, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is devised which maps each year mentioned in the text with the number of pages (lines, letters) devoted in the text to its description (which could be zero). The function of the two texts are then compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1

 | chapter = 1. The local maxima method | pages = 187–194
 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Fomenko compares the contemporary history of Rome written by [[Titus Livius]] with a modern history of Rome written by [[Russia]]n [[historian]] [[Vladimir Sergeevich Sergeev|V. S. Sergeev]], calculating that the two have high [[correlation]], and thus that they describe the same period of history, which is undisputed.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compares modern texts which describe different periods, and calculates low correlation, as expected.&lt;ref name=F2/&gt; However, when he compares, for example, the ancient history of Rome and the medieval history of Rome, he calculates a high correlation, and concludes that ancient history of Rome is a copy of medieval history of Rome, thus clashing with mainstream accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical correlation of dynasties===
[[Image:Fomenko - Roman Empire parallelism.jpg|thumb|Sample Fomenko parallelism]]
In a somewhat similar manner, Fomenko compares two [[dynasty|dynasties]] of rulers using statistical methods. First, he creates a [[database]] of rulers, containing relevant information on each of them. Then, he creates "survey codes" for each pair of the rulers, which contain a number which describes degree of the match of each considered property of two rulers. For example, one of the properties is the way of death: if two rulers were both poisoned, they get value of +1 in their property of the way of death; if one ruler was poisoned and another killed in combat, they get -1; and if one was poisoned, and another died of illness, they get 0 (Fomenko claims there is possibility that chroniclers were not impartial and that different descriptions nonetheless describe the same person). An important property is the length of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. |authorlink= Anatoly Fomenko
 | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1 | pages = 215–223

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko lists a number of pairs of unrelated dynasties &amp;ndash; for example, dynasties of kings of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and emperors of late [[Western Roman Empire]] (AD 300-476) &amp;ndash; and claims that this method demonstrates correlations between their reigns. (Graphs which show just the length of the rule in the two dynasties are the most widely known; however, Fomenko's conclusions are also based on other parameters, as described above.) He also claims that the regnal history from the 17th to 20th centuries never shows correlation of "dynastic flows" with each other, therefore Fomenko insists history was multiplied and outstretched into imaginary antiquity to justify this or other "royal" pretensions.

Fomenko uses for the demonstration of correlation between the reigns exclusively the data from the ''Chronological Tables'' of J. Blair (Moscow 1808–09). Fomenko says that Blair’s tables are all the more valuable to us since they were compiled in an epoch adjacent to the time of Scaligerian chronology. According to Fomenko these tables contain clearer signs of “Scaligerite activity” which were subsequently buried under layers of paint and plaster by historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually [[medieval]]. For example:

* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D" ("a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon"&lt;ref name="Newton72"&gt;[[Robert Russell Newton|R.R. Newton]], [http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/atext/newton1.htm "Astronomical Evidence Concerning Non-Gravitational Forces in the Earth–Moon System"]. ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]'' vol. 16 (1972), pp. 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) between the years AD 700–1300, which the American astronomer [[Robert Russell Newton|Robert Newton]] had explained in terms of "non-gravitational" (i.e., tidal) forces.&lt;ref name="Newton72"/&gt; By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the New Chronology produces a constant value of D" beginning around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly T. Fomenko, ''History: Fiction or Science'' vol.I, Chronology, 2nd. ed. (Paris, London, New York: Delamere Publishing, 2006), pp.93-94, 105-6. Newton's analysis has since been criticized as suffering "from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions." F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.23-2.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He associates initially the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with the AD 1140 (±20) [[supernova]] (now [[Crab Nebula]]) and the [[Chronology of Jesus|Crucifixion Eclipse]] with the total [[solar eclipse]] of AD 1170 (±20). He also believes that [[Crab Nebula]] [[supernova]] could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He connects it with total eclipse of AD 1186. Moreover he holds in strong doubt the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the [[star catalog]] in the ''Almagest'', ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the ''Almagest'' is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity{{clarify|date=June 2013}} is well taken into account.
* He refines and completes [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Morozov's]] analysis of some ancient [[horoscopes]], most notably, the so-called [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera Zodiacs]]—two horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the [[Hathor temple|temple of Hathor]]—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his ''History: Fiction or Science'' series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek [[Thucydides]] in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the [[Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Athens|Athenians]] he was actually describing the conflict between the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrans]] and [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]] in Spain from AD 1374 to 1387.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30–40 years.

=== Rejection of common dating methods ===

On archaeological dating methods, Fomenko claims:

{{quote|Archaeological, dendrochronological, paleographical and carbon methods of dating of ancient sources and artifacts are both non-exact and contradictory, therefore there is not a single piece of firm written evidence or artifact that could be reliably and independently dated earlier than the XI century|Anatoly Fomenko|''History: Fiction or Science? (Chronology 1) [Second edition]''}}

[[Dendrochronology]] is rejected with a claim that, for dating of objects much older than the oldest still living trees, it isn't an absolute, but a [[relative dating]] method, and thus dependent on traditional chronology. Fomenko specifically points to a break of dendrochronological scales around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 | accessdate = 2006-09-09| language = Russian
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also cites a number of cases where [[carbon dating]] of a series of objects of known age gave significantly different dates. He also alleges undue cooperation between physicists and archaeologists in obtaining the dates, since most radiocarbon dating labs only accept samples with an age estimate suggested by historians or archaeologists. Fomenko also claims that carbon dating over the range of AD 1 to 2000 is inaccurate because it has too many sources of error that are either guessed at or completely ignored, and that calibration is done with a statistically meaningless number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 | url = http://www.univer.omsk.su/foreign/fom/fom.txt | format = .txt
 | accessdate = 2006-09-09 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, Fomenko concludes that carbon dating is not accurate enough to be used on historical scale.

Fomenko rejects [[numismatics|numismatic]] dating as circular, being based on the traditional chronology, and points to cases of similar coins being minted in distant periods, unexplained long periods with no coins minted and cases of mismatch of numismatic dating with historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==
Fomenko's historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scholars, who brand them as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]], [http://humanism.al.ru/en/articles.phtml?num=000051 ''Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It'']. Ginzburg is a [[Nobel laureate]] and a member of the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt; but were popularized by former world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-tradition.org/view-garry-kasparov.htm Mathematics of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newc.narod.ru/article/nx/ksprv.htm Некоторые выступления Г.

Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of [[Byzantium]] could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=44FE98F9E4576 "Answers of Kasparov"] (in Russian). Kasparov.ru ([[gazeta.ru]]). September 6, 2006. Retrieved 2009-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as "an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, "keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia".&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor [[Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky|Gleb Nosovsky]] were awarded for their books on "New Chronology" the anti-prize called [[:ru:Антипремия «Абзац»|"Abzatz"]] (literally 'paragraph', a Russian slang word meaning 'disaster' or 'fiasco') in the category "Pochotnaya bezgramota" (the term is a pun upon "Pochotnaya gramota" ([[Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour|Certificate of Honor]]) and may be translated either "Certificate of Dishonor" or literally, "Respectable Illiteracy" ) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he [[Confirmation bias|violates a key rule of statistics]] by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko's statistical arguments.&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt; The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on "The 'Myths' of New Chronology" chaired by the dean of the department of history of [[Moscow State University]] in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;V.L. Yanin, ed., [http://www.panrus.com/books/details.php?langID=1&amp;bookID=4434 Мифы "новой хронологии": Материалы конф. на ист. фак. МГУ им. М. В. Ломоносова, 21 дек. 1999] (Myths of the new chronology: Conference of the [[MSU Faculty of History|History Faculty]] of the [[Moscow State University|MSU]]...: 21 Dec. 1999), Moscow: Russkaia Panorama, 2001. {{ISBN|9785931650463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to article on Fomenko in the [http://maik.maik.rssi.ru/abstract/herald/0/herald3_0p217abs.htm ''Herald of the Russian Academy of Sciences'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/Hronol_f.htm О "глобальной хронологии" А.Т.Фоменко] (On the "Global Chronology" A.T. Fomenko).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the participants in that round table, the distinguished Russian archaeologist, [[Valentin Yanin]], compared Fomenko's work to "the sleight of hand trickery of a [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]], [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/janin.htm "Зияющие высоты" академика Фоменко] (The "Gaping Heights" of Academician Fomenko); passage translated in James H. Billington, ''Russia in Search of Itself'', (Washington: Woodrow Wilson Center Press / Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] argued that by using the Fomenko's approaches one can "prove" any historical correspondence, for example, between Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and French kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/02_a_3855010.shtml|script-title=ru:«Фоменко — жертва фанатизма»|last=Малянов|first=Дмитрий|date=2 December 2011|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/fomenko/zaliznk.htm|script-title=ru:Лингвистика по А.

[[James H. Billington|James Billington]], formerly professor of Russian history at [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Librarian of Congress]] from 1987-2015 placed Fomenko's work within the context of the political movement of [[Eurasianism]], which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko's chronology, "Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire."&lt;ref name="James H. Billington 2004, pp. 82-4"/&gt; A French reviewer of Billington's book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global "new chronology".&lt;ref name="monderusse.revues.org" /&gt;

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the [[University of Utrecht]], concluded his scathing review of Fomenko's work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
{{quote|text=It is surprising, to say the least, that a well-known (Dutch) publisher could produce an expensive book of such doubtful intellectual value, of which the only good word that can be said is that it contains an enormous amount of factual historical material, untidily ordered, true; badly written, yes; mixed-up with conjectural nonsense, sure; but still, much useful stuff. For the rest of the book is absolutely worthless. It reminds one of the early Soviet attempts to produce [[Pathological science|tendentious science]] ([[Lysenkoism|Lysenko]]!), of [[polywater]], of [[cold fusion]], and of modern [[creationism]]. In brief: a useless and misleading book.|sign=H.G. van Bueren|source="Mathematics and Logic"&lt;ref name="Bueren 1994"/&gt;}}

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, archaeologists, conservators and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques which have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;See the international journal [http://www.radiocarbon.org/ ''Radiocarbon''] for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[dendrochronology]], Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. However, independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of [[North America]]&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Ferguson and D. A. Graybill, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume25/Number2/azu_radiocarbon_v25_n2_287_288_v.pdf "Dendrochronology of Bristlecone Pine: A Progress Report"], ''Radiocarbon'', 25 (1983): 287-288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minze Stuiver, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume24/Number1/azu_radiocarbon_v24_n1_1_26_v.pdf "A High-Precision Calibration of the AD Radiocarbon Time Scale"], ''Radiocarbon'', 24 (1982): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe&lt;ref&gt;M.

Furthermore, the mutual consistency of these independent dendrochronological sequences has been confirmed by comparing their radiocarbon and dendrochronological ages.&lt;ref&gt;Minze Stuiver, ''et al.'', [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume28/Number2B/azu_radiocarbon_v28_n2B_969_979_v.pdf "Radiocarbon Age Calibration back to 13,300 Years BP and the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C Age Matching of the German Oak and US Bristlecone Pine Chronologies"], ''Radiocarbon'', 28 (1986): 969-979.&lt;/ref&gt; These and other data have provided a calibration curve for radiocarbon dating whose internal error does not exceed ±163 years over the entire 26,000 years of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;Paula J. Reimer, ''et al.'', [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume46/Number3/azu_radiocarbon_v46_n3_1029_1058_v.pdf "INTCAL04 Terrestrial Radiocarbon Age Calibration, 0–26 Cal Kyr BP"], ''Radiocarbon'' 46 (2004): 1029-1058; data online at http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal04%20files/intcal04.14c .&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, archaeologists have developed a ''fully anchored'' dendrochronology series going back past 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich M, Remmele S, Kromer B, Hofmann J, Spurk M, Kaiser KF, Orcel C, Küppers M (2004).

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko's theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of "importance". They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of "important events", make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. What's more, Fomenko's critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data &amp;ndash; rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of [[Jesus]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSvlaZYbcwUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=2_vZeaAnuN5U6iITpdkuUK-eIlI#PPA51,M1 Book 2, Chapter 2, pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with [[John the Baptist]]. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko's John-the-Baptist equivalent [[John Crescentius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06791c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Gregory VII]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text.{{sfn|Colavito|2004}} Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an [[ad hoc hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt;

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko's discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the New Chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. For his dating of the Almagest star catalog, Fomenko arbitrarily selected eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog, one of which (Arcturus) has a large systematic error. This star has a dominant effect on Fomenko's dating.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. N. Efremov, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/efremov.htm Астрономия и синдром “новой хронологии”] (Astronomy and the Syndrome of "New Chronology").&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis using the same method for all "fast" stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dambis and Yu. N. Efremov, "Dating Ptolemy's Star Catalogue through Proper Motions: The Hipparchan Epoch", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JHA....31..115D ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 31 (2000): 115-134;] see especially note 17 (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Gorodetsky, [http://www.newchrono.net/fomenko/starwars.htm Звездные войны с историей (верификация датировки Альмагеста)] (Starry wars with history (Verification of the dating of the Almagest)).&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlins points out further that Fomenko's statistical analysis got the wrong date for the ''Almagest'' because he took as constant Earth's [[axial tilt|obliquity]] when it is a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, "Recovering Hipparchos’ Last Lost Lustrous Star", [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w43.pdf ''DIO'' 4.3 (1994): 119]. Like Dambis and Efremov, Rawlins provides evidence that the Almagest star catalog was based on observations made in the 2nd century BCE by [[Hipparchus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko's studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in [[cuneiform]] texts from [[Mesopotamia]]. Among these texts is a series of [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow us to date these observations, and consequently the rulers' reigns, to within a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy,'' (New York: Springer, 2001) pp. 39-40 {{ISBN|0-387-95136-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69. This study showed that either the description of the phenomena observed at the solar eclipse or of a set of conjunctions of the slow planets [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Mars]] were sufficient to equate [[Seleucid era|S.E.]] 175 with 137/6 BCE. Additional details in these texts provided further confirmation of this dating.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of [[Babylonia]]n, Ancient and Medieval European, and [[China|Chinese]] records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.22-2.27.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Fomenko's missing centuries, Stephenson's studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html Eclipse Predictions and Earth's Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716020131/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with New Chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; New Chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant "Russian Horde" empire and eliminating historical time before its existence.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not [[anti-semitic]] ''per se'', but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the [[Old Testament]] is newer than the [[New Testament]], placing Jerusalem in [[Constantinople]] and projecting stereotypes of [[Jew]]s by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|not the other way round]].&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; 

The theory provides an alternate history account of the "true" history centered around a world empire called the "Russian Horde".&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; The scope of the New Chronology has been compared to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|volume= |number= 2103 |pages= 1–71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of pages has been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native [[Russia]]. Many [[Internet forum]]s have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research.&lt;ref&gt;Melleuish et al. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics have suggested that Fomenko's version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and [[Russian oligarchs|post-Communist corporate oligarchies]].&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20086">'''New Philology''' generally refers to a branch of Mexican [[ethnohistory]] and [[philology]] that uses colonial-era native language texts written by Indians to construct history from the indigenous point of view. The name New Philology was coined by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] to describe work that he and his doctoral students and scholarly collaborators in history, anthropology, and linguistics had pursued since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Lockhart published a great many essays elaborating on the concept and content of the New Philology and [[Matthew Restall]] published a description of it in the ''Latin American Research Review.''&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques of the New Philology have also been applied in other disciplines such as European [[medieval]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Driscoll, "[http://www.driscoll.dk/docs/words.html The words on the page: Thoughts on philology, old and new]", in: ''Creating the medieval saga: Versions, variability, and editorial interpretations of Old Norse saga literature,'' edited by Judy Quinn &amp; Emily Lethbridge. Syddansk Universitetsforlag, Odense 2010, pp. 85–102.&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
==Historical Development==
Lockhart's discusses philology and in particular the new philology in an essay for a collection of essays hosted digitally at University of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: Background and Course of the New Philology" ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest [[Mesoamerican]] Ethnohistory'', Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the new philology was built upon the foundation of the old, which focuses on close reading of texts and resulted in collections of printed documentation. An important nineteenth-century Mexican philologist was [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]].  In Mexico and Latin America, nineteenth-century scholars mined the Spanish archives for colonial documentation for their national histories. A feature of the New Philology is that the publication of indigenous texts in the original language with translations with introductions was standard.  The translated texts often appeared first, followed by a separate scholarly monograph analyzing the texts. The two should be considered two parts of the same scholarly publication. Many of the scholars working in the New Philology did so before it gained that designation.  A particularly valuable online publication are essays where individual scholars discuss the process and product of translating and publishing particular native language documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Philology was developed from the 1970s and onwards, building on the work of a previous generation of scholars, most especially historian [[Charles Gibson]], whose ''Aztecs under Spanish Rule'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&gt;'' Charles Gibson, 1964 Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and his earlier ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)&lt;ref&gt;''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' Charles Gibson, 1952. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; were major scholarly achievements, placing colonial-era Aztecs (now more commonly called [[Nahuas]]) at the center of historical analysis. The leading figure in the establishment of the New Philological historiographical approach was [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] who, in the early 1970s, began learning Nahuatl and studying local level indigenous sources in the [[Nahuatl language]]. His magnum opus was published in 1992, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuas After the Conquest: Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, sixteenth through eighteenth centuries,'' James Lockhart, 1992. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporated and extended his own work and that of others.

An early and important text in this vein was ''Nahuatl in the Middle Years'' (1976), published by Lockhart and University of Texas linguist [[Frances Karttunen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period'', Frances Karttunen &amp; James Lockhart, 1976, University of California Press, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important for the early history of the New Philology was the publication of ''Beyond the Codices'' (1976), alluding to the existence of native language texts other than the formal ones termed codices.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Codices'' [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], Frances Berdan, and James Lockhart, 1976. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], a leading figure in Mesoamerican ethnohistory for his collaboration with [[Charles Dibble]] in publishing an English translation of the [[Florentine Codex]] by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], participated in this early project of publishing local-level colonial documents.

In the mid-1970s Lockhart began mentoring history doctoral students at UCLA, who learned Nahuatl and began research on particular region documentation in Nahuatl. Sarah Cline was the first to complete a dissertation in 1981, based on these types of local-level sources, a set of 60 testaments from the central Mexican Indian polity or ''altepetl'' of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacán]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Testaments of Culhuacan''. S.L. Cline and Miguel Leon-Portilla (Eds.) 1984. UCLA Latin American Center Nahuatl Studies Series, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Culhuacan, 1580-1600: A Social History of an Aztec Town'', S.L. Cline, 1986. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Testaments of Culhuacan, Sarah Cline. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 Cline also published a set of early local-level Nahuatl censuses from the Cuernavaca, as ''The Book of Tributes'', as well as an analysis of all three volumes, adding to the existing published corpus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Tributes: Early Sixteenth-Century Nahuatl Censuses from Morelos''. S. L. Cline, 1993, Museo de Antropología e Historia, Archivo Histórico Collección Antigua, vol. 549. UCLA Latin American Center Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of Tributes", Sarah Cline, ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Azteckischer Zensus, Zur indianischen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Marquesado um 1540: Aus dem "Libro de Tributos" (Col. Ant. Ms. 551) im Archivo Historico,'' Mexico. 2 vols. Eike Hinz, Claudine Hartau, and Marie Luise Heimann-Koenen, eds. 1983. Hanover.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first generation Robert Haskett, who examined Nahuatl texts on colonial Cuernavaca, later also publishing on primordial titles.&lt;ref&gt;''Indigenous Rulers: An Ethnohistory of Indian Town Government in Colonial Cuernavaca'', Robert Haskett, 1991, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Primordial Titles", Robert Haskett. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Schroeder delved into the rich texts produced by seventeenth-century Nahua historian, Chimalpahin, resulting in several publications &lt;ref&gt;''Chimalpahin and the Kingdoms of Chalco'', 1991, Susan Schroeder, Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Chimalpahin: Society and Politics in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco, Texcoco, Culhuacan, and other Nahua Altetpetl in Central Mexico.'' Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuantzin, Arthur J.O. Anderson, Susan Schroeder, Wayne Ruwet. 1997. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of His Time: Don Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Quahtlehuantzin''James Lockhart, Susan Schroeder, and Doris Namala.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Annals of Chimalpahin", Susan Schroeder. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of local-level indigenous documents, such as testaments and bills of sale, are in Nahuatl, resulting in Nahuatl having the largest set of published sets of documents and monographic scholarly analyses. Rebecca Horn's dissertation on Coyoacan and later Stanford University Press monograph showed the multiple connections between Nahuas and Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;''Postconquest Coyoacan: Nahua-Spanish Relations in the Valley of Mexico.'' Rebecca Horn, 1997. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nahuatl and Spanish Sources for Coyoacan", Rebecca Horn. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Horn also served as associate editor of the UCLA Latin American Center's Nahuatl Studies Series.

Some UCLA later doctoral students of Lockhart, particularly [[Matthew Restall]] and Kevin Terraciano, first learned Nahuatl and then other Mesoamerican indigenous languages (Mixtec and Yucatec Maya) that had a significant corpus of documents in the language. Restall's UCLA 1995 dissertation "The World of the Cah: postconquest Yucatec Maya Society" was followed by his 1995 publication of a collection of eighteenth-century wills.&lt;ref&gt;''Life and Death in a Maya Community: The Ixil Testaments of the 1760s.'' Matthew Restall, 1995. Lancaster CA: Labyrinthos&lt;/ref&gt; and culminating in his Stanford University Press monograph, ''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850''. Matthew Restall. 1997, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sources for the Ethnohistory and Afrohistory of Postconquest Yucatan," Matthew Restall.''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Terraciano's 1994 dissertation on the Mixtecs of Oaxaca entitled ''Ñudzahui history: Mixtec writing and culture in colonial Oaxaca'' was followed by his 2001 monograph ''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Ñudzahui History''.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Terraciano,''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Nudzahui History, sixteen through eighteenth centuries''. 2001, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Terraciano and Restall revised the titles of their dissertations in the published monographs to allow better recognition by readers of the publication's subject; Cline used "Aztec" in the title of her monograph on Culhuacan, rather than "Nahua", which in the 1980s had little recognition value even among specialists on Latin American cultures.

Lauren Lambert Jennings explicitly applied techniques from New Philology to the study of European Song texts quoting their "central premise [as] the idea that [[codex]] is not merely a neutral container for its texts." She continued by saying that the New Philologists and scholars of "textual cultures" "posit that a work's meaning (literary and cultural) is determined by the entire manuscript matrix — its physical form, contents, scribe(s), readers, and history."&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Lambert Jennings, "Tracing Voices: Song as Literature in Late Medieval Italy" (Ph.D. dissertation: University of Pennsylvania, 2012), p. 42, online at [https://usc.academia.edu/LaurenJennings/Books/1591293/Tracing_Voices_Song_as_Literature_in_Late_Medieval_Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plica''' (from [[Latin]] ''plica'' - fold) is a term from [[sigillography]] for the reinforcement of the lower edge of a [[charter]] or [[deed]], produced by folding up the bottom of the sheet of [[parchment]] to achieve a double thickness. 

The purpose of the fold is to provide a more secure anchorage for the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], and to guard against the parchment being torn. Slots were normally cut in the double thickness of parchment, a cord or tag of parchment threaded through them, and the seal attached to that.

[[File:Pompeii-couple.jpg|thumb|right|This wall painting found in the Roman city of [[Pompeii]] is an example of a primary source about people in Pompeii in Roman times. ([[Portrait of Paquius Proculo]])]]

In the study of [[history]] as an academic discipline, a '''primary source''' (also called an '''original source''') is an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], document, diary, [[manuscript]], [[autobiography]], recording, or any other source of [[information]] that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in [[library science]], and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In [[journalism]], a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalism: Primary Sources|url=http://infoguides.pepperdine.edu/c.php?g=287355&amp;p=1915752|publisher=Pepperdine University|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary sources are distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130726061349/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland. &lt;/ref&gt; A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about his or her friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. "Primary" and "secondary" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;{{rp|118–246}}&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121 |quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

==Significance of source classification==

===History===

[[File:donfelipe.jpg|thumb|360px|right|From a letter of Philip II, King of Spain, 16th century]]
In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cipolla|first=Carlo M.|title=Between Two Cultures:An Introduction to Economic History|page=27|publisher=W.

That this imposition is basic in any understanding of the past is clear from the rules that documents should not be altered, or that any material damaging to a historian's argument or purpose should not be left out or suppressed. These rules mean that the sources or the texts of the past have an integrity and that they do indeed 'speak for themselves', and that they are necessary constraints through which past reality imposes itself on the historian.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
In scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Though the terms ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' originated in [[historiography]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another.

In [[scientific literature]], a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results and theories. In [[political history]], primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns and eyewitness accounts. In the [[history of ideas]] or [[intellectual history]], the main primary sources are books, essays and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In [[religious history]], the primary sources are [[religious texts]] and descriptions of religious [[ceremonies]] and [[rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/content.php?pid=60919&amp;sid=447878|title=Primary Sources - Religion|website=Research Guides at Tufts University|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[cultural history]] could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Howell | first1 = Martha C. | last2 = Prevenier | first2 = Walter. | title = From reliable sources : an introduction to historical method | year = 2001 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, N.Y. | isbn = 0-8014-8560-6 | pages =20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Narrative]] sources''' or '''literary sources''' tell a story or message. They are not limited to fictional sources (which can be sources of information for contemporary attitudes) but include [[diary|diaries]], films, biographies, leading philosophical works and [[scientific works]].
*'''Diplomatic sources''' include [[charter]]s and other legal documents which usually follow a set format.
*'''Social documents''' are records created by organizations, such as registers of births and tax records.

In historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cripps |first=Thomas |year=1995 |title=Historical Truth: An Interview with Ken Burns |journal=American Historical Review |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=741–764 |doi=10.2307/2168603 |jstor= 2168603|publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 100, No. 3 |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lafayette College Library, provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.&lt;br&gt;
*In the [[humanities]], a primary source could be defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time.
*In the [[social sciences]], the definition of a primary source would be expanded to include numerical data that has been gathered to analyze relationships between people, events, and their environment.
*In the [[natural sciences]], a primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas. These sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on methods and results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions "Primary Sources: what are they?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208191118/http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions |date=8 February 2009 }}. Lafayette College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Finding primary sources==
Although many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in [[archives]], [[libraries]], [[museum]]s, [[historical societies]], and [[special collections]]. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be spread over a large number of different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the [[Huntington Library]] in California houses a large number of documents from the United Kingdom.

In the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The [[Library of Congress]] maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are [http://www.memory.loc.gov American Memory] and [[Chronicling America]]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] also has digital collections in [http://digitalvaults.org/ Digital Vaults]. The [[Digital Public Library of America]] searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The [[Internet Archive]] also has primary source materials in many formats.

In the UK, the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] provides a consolidated search of its own catalogue and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own on-line catalogues. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.

In other regions, [[Europeana]] has digitized materials from across Europe while the [[World Digital Library]] and [[Flickr Commons]] have items from all over the world. [[Trove]] has primary sources from Australia.

Most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or [[finding aid]]. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as [[WorldCat]], the [https://catalog2.loc.gov/ Library of Congress catalog], the [https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/ National Archives catalog], and so on.

==Using primary sources==
History as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles and papers. [[Arthur Marwick]] says "Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history."&lt;ref name=Marwick&gt;Marwick, Arthur. "Primary Sources: Handle with Care". In Sources and Methods for Family and Community Historians: A Handbook edited by Michael Drake and Ruth Finnegan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-46580-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be [[memoir]]s, autobiographies, or oral interviews taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents, or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in [[classical studies]], where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.

Historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of [[archive]]s and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;

However, primary sources – particularly those from before the 20th century – may have hidden challenges. "Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous and very difficult to analyse and interpret."&lt;ref name=Marwick/&gt; Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.

The following questions are asked about primary sources:
* What is the tone?
* Who is the intended audience?
* What is the purpose of the publication?
* What assumptions does the author make?
* What are the bases of the author's conclusions?
* Does the author agree or disagree with other authors of the subject?
* Does the content agree with what you know or have learned about the issue?
* Where was the source made? (questions of [[systemic bias]])

==Strengths and weaknesses==
In many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla/&gt; In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Jeffrey Ian|title=Taking Stock of Research Methods and Analysis on Oppositional Political Terrorism|journal=The American Sociologist|volume=35|issue=2|year=2004|pages=26–37|doi=10.1007/BF02692395|quote=The analysis of secondary source information is problematic. The further an investigator is from the primary source, the more distorted the information may be. Again, each new person may put his or her spin on the findings.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text="A history, whose author draws conclusions from other than primary sources or secondary sources actually based on primary sources, is by definition [[fiction]] and not history at all."|sign=Kameron Searle|}}

However, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be [[bias]] and tacit unconscious views which twist historical information.
{{quote|"Original material may be... prejudiced, or at least not exactly what it claims to be."|David Iredale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Iredale | first1 = David | title = Enjoying archives: what they are, where to find them, how to use them | year = 1973 | publisher = Newton Abbot, David and Charles, | isbn = 0-7153-5669-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The errors may be corrected in secondary sources, which are often subjected to [[peer review]], can be well documented, and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation. Historians consider the accuracy and [[objectivity (science)|objectiveness]] of the primary sources that they are using and historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny. A primary source such as a [[Diary|journal]] entry (or the online version, a blog), at best, may only reflect one individual's [[opinion]] on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete.

Participants and [[witness|eyewitness]]es may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara W. Sommer and Mary Kay Quinlan, ''The Oral History Manual'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, " Analysis of Primary Sources" [http://memory.loc.gov/learn/lessons/psources/analyze.html online 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be [[censorship|censored]] or altered for propaganda or [[cover-up]] purposes. The facts can be [[distortion|distorted]] to present the opposing sides in a negative light. [[Barrister]]s are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.

==Classifying sources==
Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton| first1=Margaret Stieg|last2=Charnigo|first2=Laurie|title=Historians and Their Information Sources|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=September 2004|volume=65|issue=5|page=419| doi=10.5860/crl.65.5.400|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/65/5/400.full.pdf+html|accessdate=3 January 2017}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Delgadillo|first1=Roberto|last2=Lynch|first2=Beverly|title=Future Historians: Their Quest for Information|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/60/3/245.full.pdf+html|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=May 1999|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=245–259, at 253|quote=[T]he same document can be a primary or a secondary source depending on the particular analysis the historian is doing.|ref=harv}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=10 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary&lt;ref name=Duffin&gt;{{Cite book|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name=Duffin/&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henige|first=David|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Ethnohistory, Vol. 33, No. 3|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the "primary source" may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ambraseys|first1=Nicholas|last2=Melville|first2=Charles Peter|last3=Adams|first3=Robin Dartrey|title=The Seismicity of Egypt, Arabia, and the Red Sea|year=1994|isbn=0-521-39120-2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtVqdSKnBq4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=historiography+%22primary+source%22+%22secondary+source%22|page=7|quote=The same chronicle can be a primary source for the period contemporary with the author, a secondary source for earlier material derived from previous works, but also a primary source when these earlier works have not survived|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
Historians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called [[diplomatics]].

For centuries, [[Pope]]s used the forged [[Donation of Constantine]] to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false [[Anglo-Saxon charters]], a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]], who placed false [[monumental brass]]es in a [[parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;Everyone has Roots: An Introduction to English Genealogy by Anthony J. Camp, published by Genealogical Pub. Co., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] "authenticated" the [[Hitler Diaries]], which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|UK National Archives]] in the hope of establishing a false [[provenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Introduction to record class R4|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leppard| first=David|title=Forgeries revealed in the National Archives – Times Online|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3867853.ece|work=The Sunday Times|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.&lt;ref name=Handlin&gt;[[Oscar Handlin]] and [[Arthur Meier Schlesinger]], ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–25}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7060">The '''pseudo-Council of Sinuessa''' was a purported gathering of bishops in 303 at [[Sinuessa]],&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; Italy, the purpose being a [[trial]] of [[Pope Marcellinus|Marcellinus]] on charges of [[apostasy]]. It is generally accepted&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finch303"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewel340"/&gt; that the gathering never took place and that the purported council documents were [[forgery|forged]] for political purposes in the [[6th century]] during the schism between [[Pope Symmachus]] and [[Antipope Laurentius]]. The collection of forgeries, including the ''Council of Sinuessa'', is collectively known as the [[Symmachian forgeries]].

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes
{{cquote|an alleged synod of 300 bishops, which took place in 303 at Sinuessa (between [[Rome]] and [[Capua]]) in order to inquire into the accusation against [[Pope Marcellinus|Marcellinus]] that he had sacrificed at [[Diocletian]]'s order. On the first two days Marcellinus had denied everything, but on the third day he admitted his lapse and repented; however the synod passed no sentence on him "quia prima sedes non judicatur a quoquam." When Diocletian learnt of the occurrence, he had the pope and several bishops of this synod executed ([[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]], "Konziliengeschichte", I, [[wikt:auflage|2 Aufl.]] 143–145). The spuriousness of those acts is almost certain.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;}}

The Latin phrase "quia prima sedes non judicatur a quoquam" means roughly "for the occupant of the highest [[episcopal see|see]] cannot be judged by anyone",&lt;ref name="Hefele128"/&gt; and the anecdote was produced in later centuries as evidence for the doctrine of [[papal supremacy]].&lt;ref name="Finch298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hefele128"/&gt;

==Forged account==
A primary Latin account of the pseudo-Council of Sinuessa was collected by [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi]] in 1759.&lt;ref name="Mansi1249"/&gt;
[[Ignaz von Döllinger|Döllinger]] summarizes the commonly-received account:

{{cquote|Marcellinus is conducted to the temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and there offers sacrifices, in the presence of a crowd of Christian spectators, to [[Hercules]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. At the news of this three hundred bishops leave their sees, and gather together to hold a council, first in a cavern near Sinuessa, but, as this would not hold more than fifty, afterwards in the town itself. Along with them were thirty Roman priests. Several priests and deacons are deposed, merely because they had gone away when they saw the pope enter the temple. Marcellinus, on the other hand, neither may nor can be judged, being supreme head of the church,— this conviction pervades the whole synod,— the pope can only be judged by himself. At first he attempts to palliate his act; but seventy-two witnesses make accusation against him. Thereupon he acknowledges his guilt, and himself [[papal renunciation|pronounces his own deposition]] on the 23rd of August, 303. After this the bishops remain quietly together in Sinuessa, until [[Diocletian]], upon receiving intelligence of this synod [[Roman–Persian Wars|in Persia]], sends an order for the execution of many of the three hundred, and this is carried into effect.&lt;ref name="Dollinger81"/&gt;}}

Döllinger dates the forgery to the reign of Symmachus, when Symmachus himself was being forced to answer to a synod convened by [[Theodoric]], and himself was being threatened with deposition.&lt;ref name="Dollinger85"/&gt;

==Later uses and criticism==

The story of Marcellinus and the Council of Sinuessa has been cited by later writers in support of papal supremacy.&lt;ref name="Finch298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hefele128"/&gt;

Vice versa, one scholar writes that during the reign of [[Antipope Alexander V]], [[Jean Gerson]] used the story&lt;ref name="Gerson"/&gt; "to prove the legitimacy of a council assembled without the authority of the pope."&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

The '''Shakespeare authorship question''' is the [[argument]] that someone other than [[William Shakespeare]] of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield the identity of the real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prescott|2010|p=273}}: {{"'}}Anti-Stratfordian' is the collective name for the belief that someone other than the man from Stratford wrote the plays commonly attributed to him."; {{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the idea has attracted much public interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=2–3 (3–4)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The UK and US editions of {{harvnb|Shapiro|2010}} differ significantly in pagination. The citations to the book used in this article list the UK page numbers first, followed by the page numbers of the US edition in parentheses.}} all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a [[fringe theory|fringe belief]], and for the most part acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman|2003|p=621}}: "...antiStratfordism has remained a fringe belief system"; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=450}}; {{Harvnb|Paster|1999|p=38}}: "To ask me about the authorship question ... is like asking a palaeontologist to debate a creationist's account of the fossil record."; {{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|pp=149–51}}: "I do not know of a single professor of the 1,300-member Shakespeare Association of America who questions the identity of Shakespeare ... antagonism to the authorship debate from within the profession is so great that it would be as difficult for a professed Oxfordian to be hired in the first place, much less gain tenure..."; {{Harvnb|Carroll|2004|pp=278–9}}: "I have never met anyone in an academic position like mine, in the Establishment, who entertained the slightest doubt as to Shakespeare's authorship of the general body of plays attributed to him."; {{Harvnb|Pendleton|1994|p=21}}: "Shakespeareans sometimes take the position that to even engage the Oxfordian hypothesis is to give it a countenance it does not warrant."; {{Harvnb|Sutherland|Watts|2000|p=7}}: "There is, it should be noted, no academic Shakespearian of any standing who goes along with the Oxfordian theory."; {{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|p=30}}: "...most of the great Shakespearean scholars are to be found in the Stratfordian camp..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's authorship was first questioned in the middle of the 19th century,&lt;ref name="Bate 1998 73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=73}}; {{Harvnb|Hastings|1959|p=486}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=8–16}}; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=13}}; {{Harvnb|Kathman|2003|p=622}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Bardolatry|adulation of Shakespeare]] as the [[Shakespeare's reputation|greatest writer of all time]] had become widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1989|p=167}}: By 1840, admiration for Shakespeare throughout Europe had become such that [[Thomas Carlyle]] "could say without hyperbole" that {{"'}}Shakspeare is the chief of all Poets hitherto; the greatest intellect who, in our recorded world, has left record of himself in the way of literature.{{'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's biography, particularly his humble origins and [[Shakespeare's life|obscure life]], seemed incompatible with his poetic eminence and his reputation for genius,&lt;ref name="shapiro87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=87–8 (77–8)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arousing suspicion that Shakespeare might not have written the works attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|2002|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy has since spawned a vast body of literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=317 (281)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[List of Shakespeare authorship candidates|more than 80 authorship candidates]] have been proposed,&lt;ref name="gross39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gross|2010|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the most popular being [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]]; [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]]; [[Christopher Marlowe]]; and [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=2–3 (4)}}; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of alternative candidates argue that theirs is the more plausible author, and that William Shakespeare lacked the education, aristocratic sensibility, or familiarity with the royal court that they say is apparent in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobson|2001|p=31}}: "These two notions—that the [[Shakespeare bibliography|Shakespeare canon]] represented the highest achievement of human culture, while William Shakespeare was a completely uneducated rustic—combined to persuade Delia Bacon and her successors that the [[First Folio|Folio]]'s title page and preliminaries could only be part of a fabulously elaborate charade orchestrated by some more elevated personage, and they accordingly misread the distinctive literary traces of Shakespeare's solid [[Elizabethan era#Education|Elizabethan grammar-school education]] visible throughout the volume as evidence that the 'real' author had attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Those Shakespeare scholars who have responded to such claims hold that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in attributing authorship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=90}}: "Their [Oxfordians'] favorite code is the hidden personal allusion ... But this method is in essence no different from the cryptogram, since Shakespeare's range of characters and plots, both familial and political, is so vast that it would be possible to find in the plays 'self-portraits' of, once more, anybody one cares to think of."; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|pp=87, 200}}: "It has more than once been claimed that the combination of 'biographical-fit' and cryptographical arguments could be used to establish a case for almost any individual ... The very fact that their application has produced so many rival claimants demonstrates their unreliability." {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=304–13 (268–77)}}; {{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|p=5}}: "in voicing dissatisfaction over the apparent lack of continuity between the certain facts of Shakespeare's life and the spirit of his literary output, anti-Stratfordians adopt the very Modernist assumption that an author's work must reflect his or her life. Neither Shakespeare nor his [[Elizabethan literature|fellow Elizabethan writers]] operated under this assumption."; {{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=629}}: "...deriving an idea of an author from his or her works is always problematic, particularly in a multi-vocal genre like drama, since it crucially underestimates the heterogeneous influences and imaginative reaches of creative writing."&lt;/ref&gt; and that the convergence of [[documentary evidence]] used to support Shakespeare's authorship—title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records—is the same used for all other authorial attributions of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=163–4}}: "The reasons we have for believing that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon wrote the plays and poems are the same as the reasons we have for believing any other historical event ... the historical evidence says that William Shakespeare wrote the plays and poems."; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=xii–xiii, 10}}; {{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=162}}: "Apart from the First Folio, the documentary evidence for William Shakespeare is the same as we get for other writers of the period..."&lt;/ref&gt; No such [[direct evidence]] exists for any other candidate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Love|2002|pp=198–202, 303–7}}: "The problem that confronts all such attempts is that they have to dispose of the many testimonies from Will the player's own time that he was regarded as the author of the plays and the absence of any clear contravening public claims of the same nature for any of the other favoured candidates."; {{Harvnb|Bate|1998|pp=68–73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shakespeare's authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=73}}: "No one in Shakespeare's lifetime or the first two hundred years after his death expressed the slightest doubt about his authorship."; {{Harvnb|Hastings|1959|pp=486–8}}: "...no suspicions regarding Shakespeare's authorship (except for a few mainly humorous comments) were expressed until the middle of the nineteenth century".&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the scholarly consensus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobson|2001|p=31}}; {{Harvnb|Greenblatt|2005}}: "The idea that William Shakespeare's authorship of his plays and poems is a matter of conjecture and the idea that the 'authorship controversy' be taught in the classroom are the exact equivalent of current arguments that '[[intelligent design]]' be taught alongside [[creation–evolution controversy|evolution]]. In both cases an overwhelming scholarly consensus, based on a serious assessment of hard evidence, is challenged by passionately held fantasies whose adherents demand equal time."&lt;/ref&gt; a relatively small&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|p=9}}: "Nevertheless, the skeptics who question Shakespeare's authorship are relatively few in number, and they do not speak for the majority of academic and literary professionals."&lt;/ref&gt; but highly visible and diverse assortment of supporters, including prominent public figures,&lt;ref name="Nicholl 2010 3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicholl|2010|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned the conventional attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicholl|2010|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=2 (4)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They work for acknowledgment of the authorship question as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry and for acceptance of one or another of the various authorship candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=246–9 (216–9)}}; {{Harvnb|Niederkorn|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The arguments presented by anti-Stratfordians share several characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prescott|2010|p=273}}; {{Harvnb|Baldick|2008|pp=17–18}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|1998|pp=68–70}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=2, 6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They attempt to disqualify William Shakespeare as the author and usually offer supporting arguments for a substitute candidate. They often postulate some type of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] that protected the author's true identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=15 note}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which they say explains why no documentary evidence exists for their candidate and why the historical record supports Shakespeare's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2003|p=388}}; {{Harvnb|Dobson|2001|p=31}}: "Most observers, however, have been more impressed by the anti-Stratfordians' dogged immunity to documentary evidence"; {{Harvnb|Shipley|1943|p=38}}: "the challenger would still need to produce  evidence in favour of another author. There is no such evidence."; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|p=198}}: "...those who believe that other authors were responsible for the canon as a whole ... have been forced to invoke elaborate conspiracy theories."; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=6}}: "Paradoxically, the skeptics invariably substitute for the easily explained lack of evidence concerning William Shakespeare, the more troublesome picture of a vast conspiracy of silence about the 'real author', with a total lack of historical evidence for the existence of this 'real author' explained on the grounds of a secret pact"; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=255 (225)}}: "Some suppose that only Shakespeare and the real author were in the know. At the other extreme are those who believe that it was an open secret".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most anti-Stratfordians say that the Shakespeare canon exhibits such breadth of learning and intimate knowledge of the [[Elizabethan government|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[court (royal)|court]] and politics that no one but a highly educated nobleman or court insider could have written it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|2002|pp=104–5}}; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=390, 392}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from literary references, critical commentary and acting notices, the available data regarding [[Shakespeare's life]] consist of mundane personal details such as [[vital record]]s of his [[infant baptism|baptism]], marriage and death, tax records, lawsuits to recover debts, and real estate transactions. In addition, no document attests that he received an education. No personal letters or literary manuscripts certainly written by Shakespeare of Stratford survive. Despite the low survival rate for documents of this period,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Callaghan|2013|p=11}}: "It is a 'fact' that the survival rate for early modern documents is low and that Shakespeare lived in a world prior to the systematic, all-inclusive collection of data that provides the foundation of modern bureaucracy."&lt;/ref&gt; to sceptics, these gaps in the record suggest the profile of a person who differs markedly from the playwright and poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1943|pp=37–8}}; {{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|pp=48, 50}}; {{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|p=5}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=622}}: "Fuelled by scepticism that the plays could have been written by a working man from a provincial town with no record of university education, foreign travel, legal studies or court preferment, the controversialists proposed instead a sequence of mainly [[British nobility|aristocratic]] alternative authors whose philosophically or politically occult meanings, along with their own true identity, had to be hidden in codes, cryptograms and runic obscurity."&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent public figures, including [[Walt Whitman]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Henry James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]], have found the arguments against Shakespeare's authorship persuasive, and their endorsements are an important element in many anti-Stratfordian arguments.&lt;ref name="Nicholl 2010 3"/&gt;

At the core of the argument is the nature of acceptable evidence used to attribute works to their authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=149}}: "The Shakespeare authorship debate is a classic instance of a controversy that draws its very breath from a fundamental disagreement over the nature of admissible evidence."; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=165, 217–8}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=8, 48, 112–3, 235, 298 (8, 44, 100, 207, 264)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Stratfordians rely on what has been called a "rhetoric of accumulation",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|pp=6, 117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or what they designate as [[circumstantial evidence]]: similarities between the characters and events portrayed in the works and the biography of their preferred candidate; literary parallels with the known works of their candidate; and hidden codes and [[cryptography|cryptographic]] allusions in Shakespeare's own works or texts written by contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=405, 411, 437}}; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|pp=203–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, academic Shakespeareans and literary historians rely mainly on direct documentary evidence—in the form of [[title page]] attributions and government records such as the [[Stationers' Register]] and the [[Master of the Revels|Accounts of the Revels Office]]—and contemporary testimony from poets, historians, and those players and playwrights who worked with him, as well as modern [[stylometry|stylometric studies]]. Scholars say all these converge to confirm William Shakespeare's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=253–95 (223–59)}}; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|p=198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are the same as those used to credit works to other authors and are accepted as the standard [[scholarly method|methodology]] for authorship attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=163–4}}; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=xii–xiii, 10}}; {{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case against Shakespeare's authorship==
Little is known of Shakespeare's personal life, and some anti-Stratfordians take this as circumstantial evidence against his authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crinkley|1985|p=517}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the lack of biographical information has sometimes been taken as an indication of an organised attempt by government officials to expunge all traces of Shakespeare from the historical record and to conceal the true author's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=47}}: "...on the mysterious disappearance of the accounts of the highest immediate authority over theatre in Shakespeare's age, the [[Lord Chamberlain]]s of the Household. Ogburn imagines that these records, like those of the Stratford grammar school, might have been deliberately eradicated 'because they would have showed how little consequential a figure Shakspere cut in the company.{{'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a lack of attendance records for Stratford's grammar school is taken as suggesting that they may have been destroyed to hide proof that Shakespeare did not attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=32}}: "Ogburn gives voice to his suspicion that the school records disappeared because they would have revealed William's name did not appear among those who attended it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare's background===
[[File:William Shakespeares birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon 26l2007.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A two-story house with wattle and daub walls, a timber frame, and a steeply pitched roof|John Shakespeare's house in Stratford-upon-Avon is believed to be Shakespeare's birthplace.]]
Shakespeare was born, brought up, and buried in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], where he maintained a household throughout the duration of his career in London. A [[market town]] of around 1,500 residents about {{convert|100|mi}} north-west of London, Stratford was a centre for the slaughter, marketing, and distribution of sheep, as well as for hide tanning and wool trading. Anti-Stratfordians often portray the town as a cultural backwater lacking the environment necessary to nurture a genius, and depict Shakespeare as ignorant and illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=6}}; {{Harvnb|Wells|2003|p=28}}; {{Harvnb|Kathman|2003|p=625}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=116–7 (103)}}; {{Harvnb|Bevington|2005|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's father, [[John Shakespeare]], was a glover (glove-maker) and town official. He married [[Mary Shakespeare|Mary Arden]], one of the [[Arden family|Ardens]] of [[Warwickshire]], a family of the local [[gentry]]. Both signed their names with a mark, and no other examples of their writing are extant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2001|p=122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often used as an indication that Shakespeare was brought up in an illiterate household. There is also no evidence that Shakespeare's two daughters were literate, save for two signatures by [[Susanna Hall|Susanna]] that appear to be "drawn" instead of written with a practised hand. His other daughter, [[Judith Quiney|Judith]], signed a legal document with a mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|p=295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Stratfordians consider Shakespeare's background incompatible with that attributable to the author of the Shakespeare canon, which exhibits an intimacy with court politics and culture, foreign countries, and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] sports such as [[hunting]], [[falconry]], [[real tennis|tennis]], and [[bowls|lawn-bowling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|pp=213–7, 262}}; {{Harvnb|Crinkley|1985|p=517}}: "It is characteristic of anti-Stratfordian books that they make a list of what Shakespeare must have been—a [[courtier]], a lawyer, a traveler in Italy, a [[classicism|classicist]], a falconer, whatever. Then a candidate is selected who fits the list. Not surprisingly, different lists find different candidates."&lt;/ref&gt; Some find that the works show little sympathy for upwardly mobile types such as John Shakespeare and his son, and that the author portrays individual commoners comically, as objects of ridicule. Commoners in groups are said to be depicted typically as dangerous mobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of documentary proof of Shakespeare's education is often a part of anti-Stratfordian arguments. The free [[King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon|King's New School]] in Stratford, established 1553, was about {{convert|0.5|mi|1}} from Shakespeare's boyhood home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baldwin|1944|p=464}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grammar school#Early grammar schools|Grammar school]]s varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar, the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in [[Latin]] grammar, the [[classics]], and [[rhetoric]] at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baldwin|1944|pp=164–84}}; {{Harvnb|Cressy|1975|pp=28–9}}; {{Harvnb|Thompson|1958|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Quennell|1963|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The headmaster, [[Thomas Jenkins (headmaster)|Thomas Jenkins]], and the instructors were [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honan|2000|pp=49–51}}; {{Harvnb|Halliday|1962|pp=41–9}}; {{Harvnb|Rowse|1963|pp=36–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No student registers of the period survive, so no documentation exists for the attendance of Shakespeare or any other pupil, nor did anyone who taught or attended the school ever record that they were his teacher or classmate. This lack of documentation is taken by many anti-Stratfordians as evidence that Shakespeare had little or no education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Stratfordians also question how Shakespeare, with no record of the education and cultured background displayed in the works bearing his name, could have acquired the extensive vocabulary found in the plays and poems. The author's vocabulary is calculated to be between 17,500 and 29,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nevalainen|1999|p=336}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The low figure is that of Manfred Scheler. The upper figure, from Marvin Spevack, is true only if all word forms (''cat'' and ''cats'' counted as two different words, for example), compound words, emendations, variants, proper names, foreign words, [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words, and deliberate [[malapropism]]s are included.}} No letters or signed manuscripts written by Shakespeare survive. The appearance of Shakespeare's six surviving authenticated&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1981|p=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; signatures, which they characterise as "an illiterate scrawl", is interpreted as indicating that he was illiterate or barely literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=164}}: "...most anti-Stratfordians claim that he was not even literate. They present his six surviving signatures as proof."&lt;/ref&gt; All are written in [[secretary hand]], a style of handwriting common to the era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|Kennedy-Skipton|1966|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in play writing,&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo, Grace, "Early modern handwriting", in Michael Hattaway, ed., ''A New Companion to English Renaissance Literature and Culture'', vol. 1 (2010:177-83).&lt;/ref&gt; and three of them utilize [[breviograph]]s to abbreviate the surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|Kennedy-Skipton|1966|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name as a pseudonym===
{{See also|Spelling of Shakespeare's name}}
[[File:Sonnets1609titlepage.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Book cover with Shakespeare's name spelled Shake hyphen speare|Shakespeare's name was hyphenated on the cover of the 1609 quarto edition of the Sonnets.]]
In his surviving signatures William Shakespeare did not spell his name as it appears on most Shakespeare title pages. His surname was spelled inconsistently in both literary and non-literary documents, with the most variation observed in those that were written by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman (1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is taken as evidence that he was not the same person who wrote the works, and that the name was used as a [[pseudonym]] for the true author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrell|1940|p=6}}: "The main contention of these anti-Stratfordians is that 'William Shakespeare' was a pen-name, like '[[Molière]],' '[[George Eliot]],' and '[[Mark Twain]],' which in this case cloaked the creative activities of a master scholar in high circles".&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's surname was hyphenated as "Shake-speare" or "Shak-spear" on the title pages of 15 of the 48 individual [[quarto]] (or ''Q'') editions of Shakespeare's plays (16 were published with the author unnamed) and in two of the five editions of poetry, published before the [[First Folio]]. Of those 15 title pages with Shakespeare's name hyphenated, 13 are on the title pages of just three plays, ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' ([[Early texts of Shakespeare's works|Q2]] 1598, Q3 1598, Q4 1608, and Q5 1615), ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' (Q2 1598, Q3 1602, Q4 1605, Q5 1612, and Q6 1622), and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' (Q2 1599, Q3 1604, Q4 1608, and Q5 1613).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hyphen is also present in one [[cast member|cast list]] and in six literary [[allusion]]s published between 1594 and 1623. This hyphen use is construed to indicate a pseudonym by most anti-Stratfordians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=255 (225)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that fictional descriptive names (such as "Master Shoe-tie" and "Sir Luckless Woo-all") were often hyphenated in plays, and pseudonyms such as "Tom Tell-truth" were also sometimes hyphenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|pp=59–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons proposed for the use of "Shakespeare" as a pseudonym vary, usually depending upon the social status of the candidate. Aristocrats such as Derby and Oxford supposedly used pseudonyms because of a prevailing "[[stigma of print]]", a social convention that putatively restricted their literary works to private and courtly audiences—as opposed to commercial endeavours—at the risk of social disgrace if violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saunders|1951|pp=139–64}}; {{Harvnb|May|1980|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|May|2007|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of commoners, the reason was to avoid prosecution by the authorities: Bacon to avoid the consequences of advocating a more [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican form of government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=621}}: "The plays have to be pseudonymous because they are too dangerous, in a climate of [[Master of the Revels|censorship]] and monarchical control, to be published openly."&lt;/ref&gt; and Marlowe to avoid imprisonment or worse after faking his death and fleeing the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=393, 446}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of documentary evidence===
[[File:Poet-ape1616.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Extract from a book|Ben Jonson's "[[s:On Poet-Ape|On Poet-Ape]]" from his 1616 collected works is taken by some anti-Stratfordians to refer to Shakespeare.]]
Anti-Stratfordians say that nothing in the documentary record explicitly identifies Shakespeare as a writer;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the evidence instead supports a career as a businessman and real-estate investor; that any prominence he might have had in the London theatrical world (aside from his role as a front for the true author) was because of his money-lending, trading in theatrical properties, acting, and being a shareholder. They also believe that any evidence of a literary career was falsified as part of the effort to shield the true author's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=116–7 (103–4)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the alternative authorship theories reject the surface meanings of Elizabethan and Jacobean references to Shakespeare as a playwright and instead look for ambiguities and codes. They identify him with such characters as the literary thief Poet-Ape in [[Ben Jonson]]'s poem of the same name and the foolish poetry-lover Gullio in the university play [[Parnassus plays|''The Return from Parnassus'']] (performed c. 1601). Such characters are taken as broad hints indicating that the London theatrical world knew Shakespeare was a front for an anonymous author. Similarly, praises of "Shakespeare" the writer, such as those found in the [[First Folio]], are explained as references to the real author's pen-name, not the man from Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=21, 170–1, 217}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circumstances of Shakespeare's death===
Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 in Stratford, leaving a signed will to direct the disposal of his large estate. The language of the will is mundane and unpoetic and makes no mention of personal papers, books, poems, or the 18 plays that remained unpublished at the time of his death. Its only theatrical reference—monetary gifts to fellow actors to buy [[mourning ring]]s—was [[interlineation|interlined]] after the will had been written, casting suspicion on the authenticity of the bequests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|pp=146–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monument images 1656 1904 1748.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Effigy of Shakespeare with right hand holding a quill pen and left hand resting on paper on a tasselled cushion, compared with a drawing of the effigy which shows both hands empty and resting on a stuffed sack or pillow|The effigy of Shakespeare's Stratford monument as it was portrayed in 1656, as it appears today, and as it was portrayed in 1748 before the restoration]]
Any public mourning of Shakespeare's death went unrecorded, and no eulogies or poems memorialising his death were published until seven years later as part of the [[book design|front matter]] in the First Folio of his plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|pp=166, 266–7}}, cites James Lardner, "Onward and Upward with the Arts: the Authorship Question", ''The New Yorker'', 11 April 1988, p. 103: "No obituaries marked his death in 1616, no public mourning. No note whatsoever was taken of the passing of the man who, if the attribution is correct, would have been the greatest playwright and poet in the history of the English language."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxfordian theory|Oxfordians]] think that the phrase "our ever-living Poet" (an epithet that commonly eulogised a deceased poet as having attained immortal literary fame), included in the dedication to [[Shakespeare's sonnets]] that were published in 1609, was a signal that the true poet had died by then. Oxford had died in 1604, five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=63}}; {{Harvnb|Price|2001|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakespeare's funerary monument]] in Stratford consists of a demi-figure effigy of him with pen in hand and an attached plaque praising his abilities as a writer. The earliest printed image of the figure, in [[William Dugdale|Sir William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), differs greatly from its present appearance. Some authorship theorists argue that the figure originally portrayed a man clutching a sack of grain or wool that was later altered to help conceal the identity of the true author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|p=157}}; {{Harvnb|Matus|1991|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to put to rest such speculation, in 1924 [[Marion Spielmann|M. H. Spielmann]] published a painting of the monument that had been executed before the 1748 restoration, which showed it very similar to its present-day appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spielmann|1924|pp=23–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the image failed to achieve its intended effect, and in 2005 Oxfordian [[Richard Kennedy (author)|Richard Kennedy]] proposed that the monument was originally built to honour John Shakespeare, William's father, who by tradition was a "considerable dealer in wool".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vickers|2006|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case for Shakespeare's authorship==
Nearly all academic Shakespeareans believe that the author referred to as "Shakespeare" was the same William Shakespeare who was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 and who died there in 1616. He became an actor and shareholder in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (later the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]), the [[playing company]] that owned the [[Globe Theatre]], the [[Blackfriars Theatre]], and exclusive rights to produce Shakespeare's plays from 1594 to 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare was also allowed the use of the [[honorific]] "[[gentleman]]" after 1596 when his father was granted a [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref name="montague123"&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=123–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare scholars see no reason to suspect that the name was a pseudonym or that the actor was a front for the author: contemporary records identify Shakespeare as the writer, other playwrights such as [[Ben Jonson]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] came from similar backgrounds, and no contemporary is known to have expressed doubts about Shakespeare's authorship. While information about some aspects of Shakespeare's life is sketchy, this is true of many other playwrights of the time. Of some, next to nothing is known. Others, such as Jonson, Marlowe, and [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], are more fully documented because of their education, close connections with the court, or brushes with the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|pp=265–6}}; {{Harvnb|Lang|2008|pp=29–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary scholars employ the same [[historical method|methodology]] to attribute works to the poet and playwright William Shakespeare as they use for other writers of the period: the historical record and [[stylometry|stylistic studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=163–4}}; {{Harvnb|Murphy|1964|p=4}}: "For the evidence that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon (1564–1616) wrote the works attributed to him is not only abundant but conclusive. It is of the kind, as [[E. K. Chambers|Sir Edmund Chambers]] puts it, 'which is ordinarily accepted as determining the authorship of early literature.{{'"}}; {{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=149}}: "Even the most partisan anti-Stratfordian or Oxfordian agrees that documentary evidence taken on its face value supports the case for William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon ... as author of the poems and plays"; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=xii–xiii, 10}},&lt;/ref&gt; and they say the argument that there is no evidence of Shakespeare's authorship is a form of fallacious logic known as ''[[argument from silence|argumentum ex silentio]]'', or argument from silence, since it takes the absence of evidence to be evidence of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1943|pp=37–8}},&lt;/ref&gt; They criticise the methods used to identify alternative candidates as unreliable and unscholarly, arguing that their subjectivity explains why at least as many as 80 candidates&lt;ref name="gross39"/&gt; have been proposed as the "true" author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|1953|p=165}}: "...in my opinion it is the basic unsoundness of method in this and other works of similar subject matter that explains how sincere and intelligent men arrive at such wild conclusions"; {{Harvnb|Love|2002|p=200}}; {{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=14}}; {{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They consider the idea that Shakespeare revealed himself autobiographically in his work as a cultural [[anachronism]]: it has been a common authorial practice since the 19th century, but was not during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=305 (270)}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|1998|pp=36–7}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=2–3}}; {{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 19th century, beginning at least with [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]] and [[John Keats|Keats]], critics frequently noted that the essence of Shakespeare's genius consisted in his ability to have his characters speak and act according to their given dramatic natures, rendering the determination of Shakespeare's authorial identity from his works that much more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1963|pp=259–60}}; {{Harvnb|Morita|1980|pp=22–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical evidence===

The historical record is unequivocal in assigning the authorship of the Shakespeare canon to a William Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1965|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the name appearing on the title pages of poems and plays, this name was given as that of a well-known writer at least 23 times during the lifetime of William Shakespeare of Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murphy|1964|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several contemporaries corroborate the identity of the playwright as an actor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=3–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and explicit contemporary documentary evidence attests that the Stratford citizen was also an actor under his own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1965|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598, [[Francis Meres]] named Shakespeare as a playwright and poet in his ''[[Palladis Tamia]]'', referring to him as one of the authors by whom the "English tongue is mightily enriched".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=93–4}}; {{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He names twelve plays written by Shakespeare, including four which were never published in quarto: ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'', ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', ''[[Love's Labour's Won]]'', and ''[[King John (play)|King John]]'', as well as ascribing to Shakespeare some of the plays that were published anonymously before 1598—''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]''. He refers to Shakespeare's "sug[a]red Sonnets among his private friends" 11 years before the publication of the [[Shakespeare's sonnets|Sonnets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=85}}; {{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=93–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shakespear ye Player coatofarms.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Drawing of a coat of arms with a falcon and a spear|Shakespeare's father was granted a coat of arms in 1596, which in 1602 was unsuccessfully contested by [[Ralph Brooke]], who identified Shakespeare as a "player" (actor) in his complaint.]]
In the rigid [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|social structure]] of Elizabethan England, William Shakespeare was entitled to use the honorific "gentleman" after his father was granted a coat of arms in 1596. This honorific was conventionally designated by the title [[Gentleman#William Harrison|"Master"]] or its abbreviations "Mr." or "M." prefixed to the name.&lt;ref name="montague123" /&gt; The title was included in many contemporary references to Shakespeare, including official and literary records, and identifies William Shakespeare of Stratford as the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=71, 75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from Shakespeare's lifetime include two official [[Stationers' Register|stationers' entries]]. One is dated 23 August 1600 and entered by [[Andrew Wise]] and [[William Aspley]]:

{{quote|Entred for their copies vnder the handes of the wardens. Twoo bookes. the one called: [[Much Ado About Nothing|Muche a Doo about nothinge]].

The other is dated 26 November 1607 and entered by [[Nathaniel Butter]] and John Busby:

This latter appeared on the title page of ''[[King Lear]]'' Q1 (1608) as "M. VVilliam Shake-speare, ''HIS'' True Chronicle History of the life and death of King ''Lear'', and his ''three Daughters''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's social status is also specifically referred to by his contemporaries in Epigram 159 by [[John Davies of Hereford]] in his ''The Scourge of Folly'' (1611): "To our English [[Terence]], Mr. Will. Shake-speare";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Epigram 92 by [[Thomas Freeman (poet)|Thomas Freeman]] in his ''Runne and A Great Caste'' (1614): "To Master W: Shakespeare";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|p=98}}; {{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in historian [[John Stow]]'s list of "Our moderne, and present excellent Poets" in his ''Annales'', printed posthumously in an edition by Edmund Howes (1615), which reads: "M. Willi. Shake-speare gentleman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loomis|2002|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Shakespeare's death, Ben Jonson explicitly identified William Shakespeare, gentleman, as the author in the title of his eulogy, [[s:To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us|"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us"]], published in the First Folio (1623).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague|1963|pp=77–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets identified Shakespeare the gentleman as the author in the titles of their eulogies, also published in the First Folio: [[s:Upon the Lines and Life of the Famous Scenic Poet, Master William Shakespeare|"Upon the Lines and Life of the Famous Scenic Poet, Master William Shakespeare"]] by [[Hugh Holland]] and [[s:To the Memory of the Deceased Author, Master W. Shakespeare|"To the Memory of the Deceased Author, Master W. Shakespeare"]] by [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2004|p=155}}: "Throughout the First Folio, the author is called 'Mr.' or 'Maister,' a title exactly appropriate to the social rank of William Shakespeare."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary legal recognition===
Both explicit testimony by his contemporaries and strong circumstantial evidence of personal relationships with those who interacted with him as an actor and playwright support Shakespeare's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|Loughnane|2017|pp=417–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camden on Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Extract from a book praising several poets including Shakespeare|William Camden defended Shakespeare's right to bear [[Law of heraldic arms|heraldic arms]] about the same time he listed him as one of the great poets of his time.]] The historian and antiquary [[George Buck|Sir George Buc]] served as Deputy Master of the Revels from 1603 and as [[Master of the Revels]] from 1610 to 1622. His duties were to supervise and censor plays for the public theatres, arrange court performances of plays and, after 1606, to license plays for publication. Buc noted on the title page of ''George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield'' (1599), an anonymous play, that he had consulted Shakespeare on its authorship. Buc was meticulous in his efforts to attribute books and plays to the correct author,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eccles|1933|pp=459–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1607 he personally licensed ''King Lear'' for publication as written by "Master William Shakespeare".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=254–5 (224–5)}}; {{Harvnb|Nelson|1998|pp=79–82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1602, [[Ralph Brooke]], the [[York Herald]], accused Sir [[William Dethick]], the [[Garter King of Arms]], of elevating 23 unworthy persons to the [[gentry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|p=231}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was Shakespeare's father, who had applied for arms 34 years earlier but had to wait for the success of his son before they were granted in 1596.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|pp=227–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooke included a sketch of the Shakespeare arms, captioned "Shakespear ye Player by Garter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|pp=231–2}}; {{Harvnb|Matus|1994|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The grants, including John Shakespeare's, were defended by Dethick and [[Clarenceux King of Arms]] [[William Camden]], the foremost antiquary of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Remaines Concerning Britaine''—published in 1605, but finished two years previously and before the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]] died in 1604—Camden names Shakespeare as one of the "most pregnant witts of these ages our times, whom succeeding ages may justly admire".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pendleton|1994|p=29}}: "...since he had, as Clarenceux King, responded less than three years earlier to Brooke's attack on the grant of arms to the father of 'Shakespeare ye Player' ... Camden thus was aware that the last name on his list was that of William Shakespeare of Stratford. The Camden reference, therefore, is exactly what the Oxfordians insist does not exist: an identification by a knowledgeable and universally respected contemporary that 'the Stratford man' was a writer of sufficient distinction to be ranked with (if after) [[Philip Sidney|Sidney]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[Samuel Daniel|Daniel]], [[Philemon Holland|Holland]], [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]], [[Thomas Campion|Campion]], [[Michael Drayton|Drayton]], [[George Chapman|Chapman]], and [[John Marston (poet)|Marston]]. And the identification even fulfils the eccentric Oxfordian ground-rule that it be earlier than 1616."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition by fellow actors, playwrights and writers===
[[File:Passionate Pilgrim title page comparison.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Two versions of a title page of an anthology of poems, one showing Shakespeare as the author, while a later, corrected version shows no author|The two versions of the title page of ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' (3rd ed., 1612)]]
Actors [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]] knew and worked with Shakespeare for more than 20 years. In the 1623 First Folio, they wrote that they had published the Folio "onely to keepe the memory of so worthy a Friend, &amp; Fellow aliue, as was our &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/span&gt;, by humble offer of his playes". The playwright and poet Ben Jonson knew Shakespeare from at least 1598, when the Lord Chamberlain's Men performed Jonson's play ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' at the [[Curtain Theatre]] with Shakespeare as a cast member. The Scottish poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden|William Drummond]] recorded Jonson's often contentious comments about his contemporaries: Jonson criticised Shakespeare as lacking "arte" and for mistakenly giving [[Bohemia]] a coast in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=17–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641, four years after Jonson's death, private notes written during his later life were published. In a comment intended for posterity (''Timber or Discoveries''), he criticises Shakespeare's casual approach to playwriting, but praises Shakespeare as a person: "I loved the man, and do honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as any. He was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature; had an excellent fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=272–3 (239–40)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Ben Jonson, other playwrights wrote about Shakespeare, including some who sold plays to Shakespeare's company. Two of the three [[Parnassus plays]] produced at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], near the beginning of the 17th century mention Shakespeare as an actor, poet, and playwright who lacked a university education. In ''The First Part of the Return from Parnassus'', two separate characters refer to Shakespeare as "Sweet Mr. Shakespeare", and in ''The Second Part of the Return from Parnassus'' (1606), the anonymous playwright has the actor [[William Kempe|Kempe]] say to the actor [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]], "Few of the university men pen plays well&amp;nbsp;... Why here's our fellow ''Shakespeare'' puts them all down."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=7, 8, 11, 32}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=268–9 (236–7)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An edition of ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'', expanded with an additional nine poems written by the prominent English actor, playwright, and author [[Thomas Heywood]], was published by [[William Jaggard]] in 1612 with Shakespeare's name on the title page. Heywood protested this piracy in his ''Apology for Actors'' (1612), adding that the author was "much offended with M. Jaggard (that altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold with his name." That Heywood stated with certainty that the author was unaware of the deception, and that Jaggard removed Shakespeare's name from unsold copies even though Heywood did not explicitly name him, indicates that Shakespeare was the offended author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=191}}; {{Harvnb|Montague|1963|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, in his poem "Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels" (1634), Heywood affectionately notes the nicknames his fellow playwrights had been known by. Of Shakespeare, he writes:
::Our modern poets to that pass are driven,
::Those names are curtailed which they first had given;
::And, as we wished to have their memories drowned,
::We scarcely can afford them half their sound. ...
::Mellifluous ''Shake-speare'', whose enchanting quill
::Commanded mirth or passion, was but ''Will''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=271 (238)}}; {{Harvnb|Chambers|1930|pp=218–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Playwright [[John Webster]], in his dedication to ''[[The White Devil]]'' (1612), wrote, "And lastly (without wrong last to be named), the right happy and copious industry of M. Shake-Speare, M. Decker, &amp; M. Heywood, wishing what I write might be read in their light", here using the abbreviation "M." to denote "Master", a form of address properly used of William Shakespeare of Stratford, who was titled a gentleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=270 (238)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a verse letter to Ben Jonson dated to about 1608, [[Francis Beaumont]] alludes to several playwrights, including Shakespeare, about whom he wrote,
::... Here I would let slip
::(If I had any in me) scholarship,
::And from all learning keep these lines as clear
::as Shakespeare's best are, which our heirs shall hear
::Preachers apt to their auditors to show
::how far sometimes a mortal man may go
::by the dim light of Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=271 (238–9)}}; {{Harvnb|Chambers|1930|p=224}}; {{Harvnb|Nicholl|2008|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare's death—the historical perspective===
[[File:Shakespeare monument plaque.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Commemorative plaque|The inscription on Shakespeare's monument]]
The [[Shakespeare's funerary monument|monument to Shakespeare]], erected in Stratford before 1623, bears a plaque with an inscription identifying Shakespeare as a writer. The first two Latin lines translate to "In judgment a Pylian, in genius a Socrates, in art a Maro, the earth covers him, the people mourn him, Olympus possesses him", referring to [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], [[Socrates]], [[Virgil]], and [[Twelve Olympians|Mount Olympus]]. The monument was not only referred to in the First Folio, but other early 17th-century records identify it as being a memorial to Shakespeare and transcribe the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman (3)}}; {{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir William Dugdale also included the inscription in his ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), but the engraving was done from a sketch made in 1634 and, like other portrayals of monuments in his work, is not accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|1997|pp=168, 173}}: "While Hollar conveyed the general impressions suggested by Dugdale's sketch, few of the details were transmitted with accuracy. Indeed, Dugdale's sketch gave Hollar few details to work with ... As with other sketches in his collection, Dugdale made no attempt to draw a facial likeness, but appears to have sketched one of his standard faces to depict a man with facial hair. Consequently, Hollar invented the facial features for Shakespeare. The conclusion is obvious: in the absence of an accurate and detailed model, Hollar freely improvised his image of Shakespeare's monument. That improvisation is what disqualifies the engraving's value as authoritative evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's will, executed on 25 March 1616, bequeaths "to my fellows John Hemynge [[Richard Burbage]] and Henry Cundell 26 [[shilling (English coin)|shilling]] 8 [[penny (English coin)|pence]] apiece to buy them [mourning] rings". Numerous public records, including the royal patent of 19 May 1603 that [[charter]]ed the King's Men, establish that Phillips, Heminges, Burbage, and Condell were fellow actors in the King's Men with William Shakespeare; two of them later edited his collected plays. Anti-Stratfordians have cast suspicion on these bequests, which were [[interlineation|interlined]], and claim that they were added later as part of a conspiracy. However, the will was proved in the [[Prerogative Court]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ([[George Abbot (bishop)|George Abbot]]) in London on 22 June 1616, and the original was copied into the court register with the bequests intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman (2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]] was the first poet to mention in print the deaths of Shakespeare and [[Francis Beaumont]] in his 1620 book of poems ''The Praise of Hemp-seed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kathman (4)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both had died four years earlier, less than two months apart. Ben Jonson wrote a short poem "To the Reader" commending the First Folio engraving of Shakespeare by [[Martin Droeshout|Droeshout]] as a good likeness. Included in the prefatory [[commendatory verse]]s was Jonson's lengthy eulogy "To the memory of my beloved, the Author Mr. William Shakespeare: and what he hath left us" in which he identifies Shakespeare as a playwright, a poet, and an actor, and writes:

::Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were
::To see thee in our waters yet appear,
::And make those flights upon the banks of Thames,
::That so did take Eliza, and our James!

Here Jonson links the author to Stratford's river, the Avon, and confirms his appearances at the courts of Elizabeth I and James I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1994|pp=121, 220}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] wrote the elegy "To the Memory of the Deceased Author Master W. Shakespeare" that was published in the Folio, in which he refers to "thy Stratford Moniment". Brought up four miles from Stratford-upon-Avon in the 1590s, Digges was the stepson of Shakespeare's friend, Thomas Russell, whom Shakespeare in his will designated as overseer to the executors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Basse]] wrote an elegy entitled "On Mr. Wm. Shakespeare" sometime between 1616 and 1623, in which he suggests that Shakespeare should have been buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] next to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], Beaumont, and Spenser. This poem circulated very widely in manuscript and survives today in more than two dozen contemporary copies; several of these have a fuller, variant title "On Mr. William Shakespeare, he died in April 1616", which unambiguously specifies that the reference is to Shakespeare of Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=9}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|2002|pp=111–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence for Shakespeare's authorship from his works===
Shakespeare's are the most studied secular works in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eaglestone|2009|p=63}}; {{Harvnb|Gelderen|2006|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary comments and textual studies support the authorship of someone with an education, background, and life span consistent with that of William Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=105–6, 115, 119–24}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|2002|pp=109–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shakespeare's grammar school.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of the Stratford grammar school, showing the interior of a classroom with student desks and benches|The [[King Edward VI School Stratford-upon-Avon|King Edward VI Grammar School]] at Stratford-upon-Avon]]

There is no record that any contemporary of Shakespeare referred to him as a learned writer or scholar. Ben Jonson and Francis Beaumont both refer to his lack of classical learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=64, 171}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a university-trained playwright wrote the plays, it is hard to explain the many [[classical antiquity|classical]] blunders in Shakespeare. Not only does he mistake the [[scansion]] of many classical names, in ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' he has Greeks and Trojans citing [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] a thousand years before their births.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lang|2008|pp=36–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Willinsky suggests that most of Shakespeare's classical allusions were drawn from [[Thomas Cooper (bishop)|Thomas Cooper]]'s ''Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae'' (1565), since a number of errors in that work are replicated in several of Shakespeare's plays,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willinsky|1994|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a copy of this book had been bequeathed to Stratford Grammar School by John Bretchgirdle for "the common use of scholars".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Velz|2000|p=188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics such as [[Samuel Johnson]] remarked that Shakespeare's genius lay not in his erudition, but in his "vigilance of observation and accuracy of distinction which books and precepts cannot confer; from this almost all original and native excellence proceeds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1969|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the omnivorous reading imputed to Shakespeare by critics in later years is exaggerated, and he may well have absorbed much learning from conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Love|2002|p=81}}:"As has often been pointed out, if Shakespeare had read all the books claimed to have influenced him, he would never have had time to write a word of his own. He probably picked up many of his ideas from conversation. If he needed legal knowledge it was easier to extract this from Inns-of-Court drinkers in the Devil Tavern than to search volumes of precedents."&lt;/ref&gt; And contrary to previous claims—both scholarly and popular—about his vocabulary and word coinage, the evidence of vocabulary size and word-use frequency places Shakespeare with his contemporaries, rather than apart from them. Computerized comparisons with other playwrights demonstrate that his vocabulary is indeed large, but only because the canon of his surviving plays is larger than those of his contemporaries and because of the broad range of his characters, settings, and themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|2011|pp=58–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's plays differ from those of the [[University Wits]] in that they avoid ostentatious displays of the writer's mastery of Latin or of [[Poetics (Aristotle)|classical principles of drama]], with the exceptions of co-authored plays such as the ''Henry VI'' series and ''Titus Andronicus''. Instead, his classical allusions rely on the Elizabethan grammar school curriculum. The curriculum began with [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily]]'s Latin grammar ''Rudimenta Grammatices'' and progressed to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Livy]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Plautus]], [[Terence]], and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], all of whom are quoted and echoed in the Shakespearean canon. Almost uniquely among his peers, Shakespeare's plays are full of phrases from grammar school texts and [[pedagogy]], together with caricatures of schoolmasters. Lily's ''Grammar'' is referred to in a number of plays, including ''Titus Andronicus'' (4.10), ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1.1), ''Love's Labour's Lost'' (5.1), ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (2.3), and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (4.1). Shakespeare alluded not only to grammar school but also to the petty school that children attended at age 5 to 7 to learn to read, a prerequisite for grammar school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|pp=62–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Two Noble Kinsmen by John Fletcher William Shakespeare 1634.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Title page of a play showing the co-authors John Fletcher and William Shakespeare|Title page of the 1634 quarto of ''The Two Noble Kinsmen'' by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and Shakespeare]]
Beginning in 1987, [[Ward Elliott]], who was sympathetic to the Oxfordian theory, and Robert J. Valenza supervised a continuing stylometric study that used computer programs to compare Shakespeare's stylistic habits to the works of 37 authors who had been proposed as the true author. The study, known as the Claremont Shakespeare Clinic, was last held in the spring of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Shakespeare Clinic|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tests determined that Shakespeare's work shows consistent, countable, profile-fitting patterns, suggesting that he was a single individual, not a committee, and that he used fewer relative clauses and more hyphens, [[Iambic pentameter#Rhythmic variation|feminine endings]], and [[enjambment|run-on lines]] than most of the writers with whom he was compared. The result determined that none of the other tested claimants' work could have been written by Shakespeare, nor could Shakespeare have been written by them, eliminating all of the claimants whose known works have survived—including Oxford, Bacon, and Marlowe—as the true authors of the Shakespeare canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Elliott|Valenza|2004|p=331}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's style evolved over time in keeping with changes in literary trends. His late plays, such as ''The Winter's Tale'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', and [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], are written in a style similar to that of other Jacobean playwrights and radically different from that of his Elizabethan-era plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=288 (253)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, after the King's Men began using the Blackfriars Theatre for performances in 1609, Shakespeare's plays were written to accommodate a smaller stage with more music, dancing, and more evenly divided acts to allow for trimming the candles used for stage lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=283–6 (249–51)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Keith Simonton, who researches the factors involved in musical and literary creativity, especially Shakespeare's, concludes "beyond a shadow of a doubt" that the consensus play chronology is roughly the correct order, and that Shakespeare's works exhibit gradual stylistic development consistent with that of other artistic geniuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simonton|2004|p=203}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Simonton's study, published in 2004, examined the correlation between the thematic content of Shakespeare's plays and the political context in which they would have been written. When backdated two years, the [[Chronology of William Shakespeare's plays|mainstream chronologies]] yield substantial correlations between the two, whereas the [[Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship#Dates of composition|alternative chronologies proposed by Oxfordians]] display no relationship regardless of the time lag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simonton|2004|p=210}}: "If the Earl of Oxford wrote these plays, then he not only displayed minimal stylistic development over the course of his career (Elliot &amp; Valenza, 2000), but he also wrote in monastic isolation from the key events of his day."&lt;/ref&gt; Simonton, who declared his Oxfordian sympathies in the article and had expected the results to support Oxford's authorship, concluded that "that expectation was proven wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simonton|2004|p=210, note 4}}: "For the record, I find the traditional attribution to William Shakespeare of Stratford highly improbable ... I really would like Edward de Vere to be the author of the plays and poems ... Thus, I had hoped that the current study might strengthen the case on behalf of the Oxfordian attribution. I think that expectation was proven wrong."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare co-authored half of his last 10 plays, collaborating closely with other playwrights. Oxfordians claim that those plays were finished by others after the death of Oxford. However, textual evidence from the late plays indicates that Shakespeare's collaborators were not always aware of what Shakespeare had done in a previous scene, and that they were following a rough outline rather than working from an unfinished script left by a long-dead playwright. For example, in ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'' (1612–1613), written with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], Shakespeare has two characters meet and leaves them on stage at the end of one scene, yet Fletcher has them act as if they were meeting for the first time in the following scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=293–4 (258–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bardolatry and early doubt===
{{See also|Shakespeare's reputation}}
Despite adulatory tributes attached to his works, Shakespeare was not considered the world's greatest writer in the century and a half following his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=30 (29)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation was that of a good playwright and poet among many others of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=30–3 (29–32)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s plays dominated popular taste after the theatres reopened in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration Era]] in 1660, with Ben Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays vying for second place. After the actor [[David Garrick]] mounted the [[Shakespeare Jubilee|Shakespeare Stratford Jubilee]] in 1769, Shakespeare led the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelpearl|1990|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding a handful of minor 18th-century [[satirical]] and [[allegory|allegorical]] references,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedman|Friedman|1957|pp=1–4}} quoted in {{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=56}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there was no suggestion in this period that anyone else might have written the works.&lt;ref name="Bate 1998 73"/&gt; The authorship question emerged only after Shakespeare had come to be regarded as the English [[national poet]] and a unique genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=99–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 19th century, adulation was in full swing, with Shakespeare singled out as a transcendent genius, a phenomenon for which [[George Bernard Shaw]] coined the term "[[bardolatry]]" in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2003|p=329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the century his genius was noted as much for its intellectual as for its imaginative strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1989|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since what was known about his life seemed to reveal Shakespeare as an untutored rustic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobson|2001|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; uneasiness began to emerge over the dissonance between Shakespeare's reputation and his biography.&lt;ref name="shapiro87" /&gt; Although still convinced that Shakespeare was the author of the works, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] expressed this disjunction in a lecture in 1846 by allowing that he could not reconcile Shakespeare's verse with the image of a jovial actor and theatre manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=19}}: "The Egyptian verdict of the Shakspeare Societies comes to mind; that he was a jovial actor and manager. I can not marry this fact to his verse."&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[historical criticism]], which challenged the authorial unity of [[Homer]]'s [[Homeric Question|epics]] and the historicity of the [[Bible]], also fuelled emerging puzzlement over Shakespeare's authorship, which in one critic's view was "an accident waiting to happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobson|2001|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Strauss]]'s investigation of [[Quest for the historical Jesus|the biography of Jesus]], which shocked the public with its scepticism of the historical accuracy of the Gospels, influenced the secular debate about Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=83–9 (73–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Samuel Mosheim Schmucker]] endeavoured to rebut Strauss's doubts about the [[Christ myth theory|historicity of Christ]] by applying the same techniques satirically to the records of Shakespeare's life in his ''Historic Doubts Respecting Shakespeare, Illustrating Infidel Objections Against the Bible''. Schmucker, who never doubted that Shakespeare was Shakespeare, unwittingly anticipated and rehearsed many of the later arguments for alternative authorship candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gross|2010|p=40}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=86–9 (76–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open dissent and the first alternative candidate===
[[File:Delia-Bacon (1811-1859).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Seated woman in shawl and bonnet.|Delia Bacon was the first writer to formulate a comprehensive theory that Shakespeare was not the writer of the works attributed to him.]]
Shakespeare's authorship was first openly questioned in the pages of [[Joseph C. Hart]]'s ''[[The Romance of Yachting]]'' (1848). Hart argued that the plays contained evidence that many different authors had worked on them. Four years later Dr. Robert W. Jameson anonymously published "Who Wrote Shakespeare?" in the ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'', expressing similar views. In 1856 [[Delia Bacon]]'s unsigned article "William Shakspeare and His Plays; An Enquiry Concerning Them" appeared in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=21–3, 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1845, Delia Bacon had theorised that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were actually written by a group under the leadership of Sir Francis Bacon, with [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] as the main writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1958|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whose purpose was to inculcate an advanced political and philosophical system for which they themselves could not publicly assume responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=97–8, 106–9 (87, 95–7)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bacon was the first single alternative author proposed in print, by William Henry Smith, in a pamphlet published in September 1856 (''Was Lord Bacon the Author of Shakspeare's Plays? A Letter to Lord Ellesmere'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=119–20 (105–6)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Delia Bacon published a book outlining her theory: ''The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, Judge Nathaniel Holmes of Kentucky published the 600-page ''The Authorship of Shakespeare'' supporting Smith's theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea began to spread widely. By 1884 the question had produced more than 250 books, and Smith asserted that the war against the Shakespeare hegemony had almost been won by the [[Baconian theory|Baconians]] after a 30-year battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=404}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the Francis Bacon Society was founded in England to promote the theory. The society still survives and publishes a journal, ''Baconiana'', to further its mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hackett|2009|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These arguments against Shakespeare's authorship were answered by academics. In 1857 the English critic [[George Henry Townsend]] published ''William Shakespeare Not an Impostor'', criticising what he called the slovenly scholarship, false premises, specious parallel passages, and erroneous conclusions of the earliest proponents of alternative authorship candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=403}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search for proof===
[[File:Cipher wheel.jpg|thumb|alt=A long strip of canvas is stretched between two wheels; pages of text are pasted to the canvas.|[[Orville Ward Owen]] constructed a "cipher wheel" that he used to search for hidden [[ciphers]] he believed [[Francis Bacon]] had left in [[Shakespeare's works]].]]
In 1853, with the help of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Delia Bacon travelled to England to search for evidence to support her theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of performing archival research, she sought to unearth buried manuscripts, and unsuccessfully tried to persuade a caretaker to open Bacon's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=113–4 (100–1)}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed she had deciphered instructions in Bacon's letters to look beneath Shakespeare's Stratford gravestone for papers that would prove the works were Bacon's, but after spending several nights in the [[chancel]] trying to summon the requisite courage, she left without prising up the stone slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=391–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciphers became important to the Baconian theory, as they would later to the advocacy of other authorship candidates, with books such as [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]]'s ''The Great Cryptogram'' (1888) promoting the approach. Dr. [[Orville Ward Owen]] constructed a "cipher wheel", a 1,000-foot strip of canvas on which he had pasted the works of Shakespeare and other writers and mounted on two parallel wheels so he could quickly collate pages with key words as he turned them for decryption.&lt;ref name="wadsworth57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=57}}; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=412}}; {{Harvnb|Hackett|2009|pp=154–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his multi-volume ''Sir Francis Bacon's Cipher Story'' (1893), he claimed to have discovered Bacon's autobiography embedded in Shakespeare's plays, including the revelation that Bacon was the secret son of Queen Elizabeth, thus providing more motivation to conceal his authorship from the public.&lt;ref name="wadsworth57" /&gt;

[[File:Shakespeare trial 1916.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A page from a 1916 newspaper with headline "Aha! Sherlock is outdone!"|A feature in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on the 1916 trial of Shakespeare's authorship. From left: George Fabyan; Judge Tuthill; Shakespeare and Bacon; [[William Nicholas Selig|William Selig]].]]
Perhaps because of Francis Bacon's legal background, both mock and real jury trials figured in attempts to prove claims for Bacon, and later for Oxford. The first mock trial was conducted over 15 months in 1892–93, and the results of the debate were published in the Boston monthly ''The Arena''. Ignatius Donnelly was one of the [[plaintiff]]s, while [[Frederick James Furnivall|F. J. Furnivall]] formed part of the defence. The 25-member jury, which included [[Henry George]], [[Edmund Gosse]], and [[Henry Irving]], came down heavily in favour of William Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=55–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, Judge Richard Tuthill presided over a real trial in Chicago. A film producer brought an action against a Baconian advocate, [[George Fabyan]]. He argued that Fabyan's advocacy of Bacon threatened the profits expected from a forthcoming film about Shakespeare. The judge determined that ciphers identified by Fabyan's analysts proved that Francis Bacon was the author of the Shakespeare canon, awarding Fabyan $5,000 in damages. In the ensuing uproar, Tuthill rescinded his decision, and another judge, Frederick A. Smith, dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=199}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=74–5}}; {{Harvnb|Niederkorn|2004|pp=82–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Owen claimed he had decoded instructions revealing that a box containing proof of Bacon's authorship had been buried in the [[River Wye]] near [[Chepstow Castle]] on the [[Duke of Beaufort]]'s property. His dredging machinery failed to retrieve any concealed manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=144–5 (127)}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=63–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year his former assistant, [[Elizabeth Wells Gallup]], financed by George Fabyan, likewise travelled to England. She believed she had decoded a message, by means of a [[Bacon's cipher|biliteral cipher]], revealing that Bacon's secret manuscripts were hidden behind panels in [[Canonbury|Canonbury Tower]] in [[Islington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=144 (127)}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; None were found. Two years later, the American humorist [[Mark Twain]] publicly revealed his long-held anti-Stratfordian belief in ''[[Is Shakespeare Dead?]]'' (1909), favouring Bacon as the true author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=149–58 (130–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s [[Walter Conrad Arensberg]] became convinced that Bacon had willed the key to his cipher to the [[Rosicrucians]]. He thought this society was still active, and that its members communicated with each under the aegis of the Church of England. On the basis of cryptograms he detected in the sixpenny tickets of admission to Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, he deduced that both Bacon and his mother were secretly buried, together with the original manuscripts of Shakespeare's plays, in the Lichfield [[Chapter house]] in [[Staffordshire]]. He unsuccessfully petitioned the [[Dean of Lichfield]] to allow him both to photograph and excavate the obscure grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=80–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=422–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Bauer was convinced that Bacon's manuscripts had been imported into [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1653, and could be found in the Bruton Vault at [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. She gained permission in the late 1930s to excavate, but authorities quickly withdrew her permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=88–9}}; {{Harvnb|Garber|1997|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 Roderick Eagle was allowed to open the tomb of [[Edmund Spenser]] to search for proof that Bacon was Shakespeare, but found only some old bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other candidates emerge===
By the end of the 19th century other candidates had begun to receive attention. In 1895 [[Wilbur G. Zeigler]], an attorney, published the novel ''It Was Marlowe: A Story of the Secret of Three Centuries'', whose premise was that Christopher Marlowe did not die in 1593, but rather survived to write Shakespeare's plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=446}}; {{Harvnb|Zeigler|1895|pp=v–xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] who, in the February 1902 issue of ''[[Current Literature]]'', wrote an article based upon his stylometric work titled "Did Marlowe write Shakespeare?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Bleibtreu]], a German literary critic, advanced the nomination of [[Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland]], in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=106–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutland's candidacy enjoyed a brief flowering, supported by a number of other authors over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|1966|pp=730–731}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Stratfordians unaffiliated to any specific authorship candidate also began to appear. [[George Greenwood]], a British barrister, sought to disqualify William Shakespeare from the authorship in ''The Shakespeare Problem Restated'' (1908), but did not support any alternative authors, thereby encouraging the search for candidates other than Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1908}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=99–100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John M. Robertson]] published ''The Baconian Heresy: A Confutation'' in 1913, refuting the contention that Shakespeare had expert legal knowledge by showing that legalisms pervaded Elizabethan and Jacobean literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robertson|1913}}; {{Harvnb|Vickers|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, on the three-hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's death, [[Henry Watterson]], the long-time editor of ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'', wrote a widely syndicated front-page feature story supporting the Marlovian theory and, like Zeigler, created a fictional account of how it might have happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wall|1956|pp=293–294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the First World War, Professor [[Abel Lefranc]], an authority on French and English literature, argued the case for William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, as the author based on biographical evidence he had gleaned from the plays and poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=101–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shakespeare Identified cover.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Cover of a book with title and author.|J. Thomas Looney's ''Shakespeare Identified'' (1920) made Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, the top authorship claimant.]]
With the appearance of [[J. Thomas Looney]]'s ''Shakespeare Identified'' (1920),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Looney|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, quickly ascended as the most popular alternative author.&lt;ref name="may222"&gt;{{Harvnb|May|2004|p=222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Looney and Greenwood founded the [[Shakespeare Fellowship]], an international organisation to promote discussion and debate on the authorship question, which later changed its mission to propagate the Oxfordian theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=218 (192)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 Archie Webster published "Was Marlowe the Man?" in ''The National Review'', like Zeigler, Mendenhall and Watterson proposing that Marlowe wrote the works of Shakespeare, and arguing in particular that the Sonnets were an autobiographical account of his survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Webster|1923|pp=81–6}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 [[Allardyce Nicoll]] announced the discovery of a manuscript that appeared to establish [[James Wilmot]] as the earliest proponent of Bacon's authorship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicoll|1932|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but recent investigations have identified the manuscript as a forgery probably designed to revive Baconian theory in the face of Oxford's ascendancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=11–4, 319–20 (11–3, 284)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another authorship candidate emerged in 1943 when writer [[Alden Brooks]], in his ''Will Shakspere and the Dyer's hand'', argued for Sir [[Edward Dyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1943}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Six years earlier Brooks had dismissed Shakespeare as the playwright by proposing that his role in the deception was to act as an Elizabethan "play broker", [[broker]]ing the plays and poems on behalf of his various principals, the real authors. This view, of Shakespeare as a commercial go-between, was later adapted by Oxfordians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=135, 139–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War, Oxfordism and anti-Stratfordism declined in popularity and visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=228–9 (200–1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Copious archival research had failed to confirm Oxford or anyone else as the true author, and publishers lost interest in books advancing the same theories based on alleged circumstantial evidence. To bridge the evidentiary gap, both Oxfordians and Baconians began to argue that hidden clues and allusions in the Shakespeare canon had been placed there by their candidate for the benefit of future researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=220–1 (194)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To revive interest in Oxford, in 1952 Dorothy and [[Charlton Greenwood Ogburn|Charlton Ogburn Sr.]] published the 1,300-page ''This Star of England'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ogburn|Ogburn|1952}}.&lt;/ref&gt; now regarded as a classic Oxfordian text.&lt;ref name="wadsworth127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that the "fair youth" of the sonnets was [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]], the offspring of a love affair between Oxford and the Queen, and that the "Shakespeare" plays were written by Oxford to memorialise the passion of that affair. This became known as the "[[Prince Tudor theory]]", which postulates that the Queen's illicit offspring and his father's authorship of the Shakespeare canon were covered up as an Elizabethan state secret. The Ogburns found many parallels between Oxford's life and the works, particularly in ''[[Hamlet]]'', which they characterised as "straight biography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hackett|2009|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A brief upsurge of enthusiasm ensued, resulting in the establishment of the Shakespeare Oxford Society in the US in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=228 (201)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Broadway press agent [[Calvin Hoffman]] revived the Marlovian theory with the publication of ''The Murder of the Man Who Was "Shakespeare"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year he went to England to search for documentary evidence about Marlowe that he thought might be buried in his literary patron [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Sir Thomas Walsingham]]'s tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing was found.

A series of critical academic books and articles held in check any appreciable growth of anti-Stratfordism, as academics attacked its methodology as unscholarly and the conclusions as ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=229 (202)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Cryptography|cryptologists]] [[William F. Friedman|William]] and [[Elizebeth Friedman]] won the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] Literary Prize in 1955 for a study of the arguments that the works of Shakespeare contain hidden ciphers. The study disproved all claims that the works contain ciphers, and was condensed and published as ''The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined'' (1957). Soon after, four major works were issued surveying the history of the anti-Stratfordian phenomenon from a mainstream perspective: ''The Poacher from Stratford'' (1958), by [[Frank W. Wadsworth|Frank Wadsworth]], ''Shakespeare and His Betters'' (1958), by Reginald Churchill, ''The Shakespeare Claimants'' (1962), by H. N. Gibson, and ''Shakespeare and His Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy'' (1962), by George L. McMichael and Edgar M. Glenn. In 1959 the ''[[ABA Journal|American Bar Association Journal]]'' published a series of articles and letters on the authorship controversy, later anthologised as ''Shakespeare Cross-Examination'' (1961). In 1968 the newsletter of The Shakespeare Oxford Society reported that "the missionary or evangelical spirit of most of our members seems to be at a low ebb, dormant, or non-existent".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=228–9 (201)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, membership in the society stood at 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=230 (202)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship in the mainstream media===

The freelance writer [[Charlton Ogburn|Charlton Ogburn Jr.]], elected president of The Shakespeare Oxford Society in 1976, promptly began a campaign to bypass the academic establishment; he believed it to be an "entrenched authority" that aimed to "outlaw and silence dissent in a supposedly free society". He proposed fighting for public recognition by portraying Oxford as a candidate on equal footing with Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=230–3 (202–5)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Ogburn published his 900-page ''The Mysterious William Shakespeare: the Myth and the Reality'', and by framing the issue as one of fairness in the atmosphere of conspiracy that permeated America after [[Watergate]], he used the media to circumnavigate [[academia]] and appeal directly to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=232–3 (204–5)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ogburn's efforts secured Oxford the place as the most popular alternative candidate. He also kick-started the modern revival of the Oxfordian movement by adopting a policy of seeking publicity through moot court trials, media debates, television, and other outlets. These methods were later extended to the Internet, including [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=47}}; {{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=48, 72, 124}}; {{Harvnb|Kathman|2003|p=620}}; {{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=430–40}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=229–49 (202–19)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minerva Britanna Peacham device.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Title page of a book with a drawing of a hand writing a motto; a curtain hides the body of the writer.|A device from [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]]'s ''Minerva Britanna'' (1612) has been used by Baconians and Oxfordians alike as coded evidence for concealed authorship of the Shakespeare canon.&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;[[#{{harvid|Ross}}|Ross (''Oxfordian Myths'')]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ogburn believed that academics were best challenged by recourse to law, and on 25 September 1987 three [[judge|justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] convened a one-day [[moot court]] at the [[United Methodist Church|Metropolitan Memorial United Methodist Church]], to hear the Oxfordian case. The trial was structured so that literary experts would not be represented, but the burden of proof was on the Oxfordians. The justices determined that the case was based on a conspiracy theory, and that the reasons given for this conspiracy were both incoherent and unpersuasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=242–3 (212–3)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ogburn took the verdict as a "clear defeat", Oxfordian columnist [[Joseph Sobran]] thought the trial had effectively dismissed any other Shakespeare authorship contender from the public mind and provided legitimacy for Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=234–6 (206–8)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A retrial was organised the next year in the United Kingdom to potentially reverse the decision. Presided over by three [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]], the court was held in the [[Inner Temple]] in London on 26 November 1988. On this occasion Shakespearean scholars argued their case, and the outcome confirmed the American verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=236–7 (208–9)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to the rising visibility of the authorship question, media coverage of the controversy increased, with many outlets focusing on the [[Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship|Oxfordian]] theory. In 1989 the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] television show [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|''Frontline'']] broadcast "The Shakespeare Mystery", exposing the interpretation of Oxford-as-Shakespeare to more than 3.5 million viewers in the US alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=238 (209)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1992 by a three-hour ''Frontline'' teleconference, "Uncovering Shakespeare: an Update", moderated by [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=238 (209–10)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' published a debate between Tom Bethell, presenting the case for Oxford,&lt;ref name="Bethell1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irvin Leigh Matus]], presenting the case for Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matus|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar print debate took place in 1999 in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' under the title "The Ghost of Shakespeare". Beginning in the 1990s Oxfordians and other anti-Stratfordians increasingly turned to the Internet to promulgate their theories, including creating several articles on Wikipedia about the candidates and the arguments, to such an extent that a survey of the field in 2010 judged that its presence on Wikipedia "puts to shame anything that ever appeared in standard resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=246–8 (216–8)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2007 the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition issued an [[internet petition]], the [[Declaration of Reasonable Doubt|"Declaration of Reasonable Doubt About the Identity of William Shakespeare"]], coinciding with [[Brunel University]]'s announcement of a one-year Master of Arts programme in Shakespeare authorship studies (since suspended). The coalition intended to enlist broad public support so that by 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, the academic Shakespeare establishment would be forced to acknowledge that legitimate grounds for doubting Shakespeare's authorship exist, a goal that was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=248–9 (218–9)}}; {{Harvnb|Hackett|2009|pp=171–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,200 signatures were collected by the end of 2007, and as of 23 April 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death and the self-imposed deadline, the document had been signed by 3,348 people, including 573 self-described current and former academics. On 22 April 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a survey of 265 American Shakespeare professors on the Shakespeare authorship question. To the question of whether there is good reason to question Shakespeare's authorship, 6 per cent answered "yes", and 11 percent "possibly". When asked their opinion of the topic, 61 per cent chose "A theory without convincing evidence" and 32 per cent chose "A waste of time and classroom distraction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Niederkorn|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[James S. Shapiro]] surveyed the authorship question in ''Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?'' Approaching the subject sociologically, Shapiro found its origins to be grounded in a vein of traditional scholarship going back to [[Edmond Malone]], and criticised academia for ignoring the topic, which was, he argued, tantamount to surrendering the field to anti-Stratfordians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=4, 42 (5, 39)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro links the revival of the Oxfordian movement to the cultural changes that followed the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate conspiracy scandal]] that increased the willingness of the public to believe in governmental conspiracies and cover-ups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=231–32, 239–41 (203–4, 210–2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Sawyer suggests that the increased presence of anti-Stratfordian ideas in popular culture can be attributed to the proliferation of [[9/11 conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] since the [[9/11]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sawyer|2013|pp=28–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, ''[[Anonymous (film)|Anonymous]],'' a feature film based on the [[Prince Tudor theory|"Prince Tudor"]] variant of the Oxfordian theory, written by [[John Orloff]] and directed by [[Roland Emmerich]], premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. De Vere is portrayed as a literary [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who becomes the lover of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], with whom he sires Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, only to discover that he himself may be the Queen's son by an earlier lover. He eventually sees his suppressed plays performed through the front man, William Shakespeare, who is portrayed as an opportunistic actor and the movie's comic foil. Oxford agrees to Elizabeth's demand that he remain anonymous as part of a bargain for saving their son from execution as a traitor for supporting the [[Essex Rebellion]] against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Syme|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months before the release of the film, the [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]] launched a campaign attacking anti-Stratfordian arguments by means of a web site, ''60 Minutes With Shakespeare: Who Was William Shakespeare?'', containing short audio contributions recorded by actors, scholars and other celebrities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was quickly followed by a rebuttal from the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edmondson|2013|pp=233, 278.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Paul Edmondson and [[Stanley Wells]] have written a short e-book, ''Shakespeare Bites Back'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edmondson|Wells|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and edited a longer book of essays by prominent academic Shakespeareans, ''Shakespeare Beyond Doubt'' (2013), in which Edmondson says that they had "decided to lead the Shakespeare Authorship Campaign because we thought more questions would be asked by our visitors and students because of ''Anonymous'', because we saw, and continue to see, something very wrong with the way doubts about Shakespeare's authorship are being given academic credibility by the Universities of Concordia and Brunel, and because we felt that merely ignoring the anti-Shakespearians was inappropriate at a time when their popular voice was likely to be gaining more ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edmondson|2013|p=229.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative candidates==
{{Main|List of Shakespeare authorship candidates}}

While more than 80 historical figures have been nominated at one time or another as the true author of the Shakespearean canon,&lt;ref name="gross39" /&gt; only a few of these claimants have attracted significant attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sole candidates, various "group" theories have also achieved a notable level of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=18–9, 72–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group theories===
Various group theories of Shakespearean authorship were proposed as early as the mid-19th century. The first published book focused entirely on the authorship debate, ''The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded'', by Delia Bacon, appeared in 1857. It proposed the first "group theory", attributing the works to "a little clique of disappointed and defeated politicians" led by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] which included Sir [[Francis Bacon]] and perhaps [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Lord Buckhurst]], and [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=107 (95)}}; {{harvnb|Holderness|2013|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group theory was also described in [[Gilbert Slater]]'s ''The Seven Shakespeares'' (1931), in which he theorised that the works were written by seven different authors: Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, Sir Walter Raleigh, [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Mary Sidney|Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke]], and [[Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoffman|1960|pp=vii–ix}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s, Edward de Vere, Francis Bacon, Roger Manners, William Herbert and Mary Sidney were suggested as members of a group referred to as "The Oxford Syndicate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=72–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Marlowe, [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] and [[Thomas Nashe]] have also been proposed as participants. Some variants of the group theory also include William Shakespeare of Stratford as the group's manager, broker and/or front man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=18–9, 25, 27, 90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sir Francis Bacon===
{{Main|Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship}}&lt;!---This is a SUMMARY: detailed additions should be placed in the article on 'Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship'---&gt;
[[File:Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait with side view of a bearded man wearing a tall hat; the face looks out of the picture.|[[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626)]]
The leading candidate of the 19th century was one of the great intellectual figures of Jacobean England, [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]], a lawyer, philosopher, essayist and scientist. Bacon's candidacy relies upon historical and literary conjectures, as well as alleged cryptographical revelations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=23–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon was proposed as sole author by William Henry Smith in 1856 and as a co-author by Delia Bacon in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Churchill|1958|pp=34–5, 70–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith compared passages such as Bacon's "Poetry is nothing else but feigned history" with Shakespeare's "The truest poetry is the most feigning" (''[[As You Like It]]'', 3.3.19–20), and Bacon's "He wished him not to shut the gate of your Majesty's mercy" with Shakespeare's "The gates of mercy shall be all shut up" (''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', 3.3.10).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|pp=119–20 (105–6)}}; {{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Delia Bacon argued that there were hidden political meanings in the plays and parallels between those ideas and Bacon's known works. She proposed him as the leader of a group of disaffected philosopher-politicians who tried to promote republican ideas to counter the despotism of the Tudor-Stuart monarchies through the medium of the public stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=387, 389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Bacon supporters found similarities between a great number of specific phrases and aphorisms from the plays and those written by Bacon in his [[waste book]], the ''Promus''. In 1883 Mrs. Henry Pott edited Bacon's ''Promus'' and found 4,400 parallels of thought or expression between Shakespeare and Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=41}}; {{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=151–71}}; {{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter addressed to [[John Davies of Hereford|John Davies]], Bacon closes "so desireing you to bee good to concealed poets", which according to his supporters is self-referential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=57–63}}; {{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Baconians argue that while Bacon outlined both a scientific and moral philosophy in ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]'' (1605), only the first part was published under his name during his lifetime. They say that his moral philosophy, including a revolutionary politico-philosophic system of government, was concealed in the Shakespeare plays because of its threat to the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baconians suggest that the great number of legal allusions in the Shakespeare canon demonstrate the author's expertise in the law. Bacon became [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1596 and was appointed [[Law Officers of the Crown#England and Wales|Attorney General]] in 1613. Bacon also paid for and helped write speeches for a number of entertainments, including [[masque]]s and [[dumbshow]]s, although he is not known to have authored a play. His only attributed verse consists of seven [[metrical psalter]]s, following [[Metrical psalter#Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter|Sternhold and Hopkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|1957|p=176 note}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Bacon was knowledgeable about ciphers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bacon|2002|pp=318, 693}}.&lt;/ref&gt; early Baconians suspected that he left his signature encrypted in the Shakespeare canon. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries many Baconians claimed to have discovered ciphers throughout the works supporting Bacon as the true author. In 1881, C. F. Ashwood Windle claimed she had found carefully worked-out jingles in each play that identified Bacon as the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=42–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked a cipher craze, and probative cryptograms were identified in the works by Ignatius Donnelly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=53–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Orville Ward Owen, [[Elizabeth Wells Gallup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|pp=62–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Isaac Hull Platt. Platt argued that the Latin word ''[[honorificabilitudinitatibus]]'', found in ''Love's Labour's Lost'', can be read as an anagram, yielding ''Hi ludi F. Baconis nati tuiti orbi'' ("These plays, the offspring of F. Bacon, are preserved for the world.").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruthven|2001|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1920s, the leading alternative authorship candidate has been [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] and [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] of England. Oxford followed his grandfather and father in sponsoring companies of actors, and he had patronised a company of musicians and one of tumblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2003|pp=13, 248}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford was an important courtier poet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May|1991|pp=53–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; praised as such and as a playwright by [[George Puttenham]] and Francis Meres, who included him in a list of the "best for comedy amongst us". Examples of his poetry but none of his theatrical works survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2003|pp=386–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford was noted for his literary and theatrical patronage. Between 1564 and 1599, 33 works were dedicated to him, including works by [[Arthur Golding]], [[John Lyly]], [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] and [[Anthony Munday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May|1980|pp=8–}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1583 he bought the sublease of the [[Blackfriars Theatre#First Theatre|first Blackfriars Theatre]] and gave it to the poet-playwright Lyly, who operated it for a season under Oxford's patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1964|pp=151, 155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxfordians believe certain literary allusions indicate that Oxford was one of the most prominent "suppressed" [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] and/or [[pseudonym]]ous writers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Al, and Judy Woodruff. The Shakespeare Mystery. PBS, Frontline, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; They also note Oxford's connections to the London theatre and the contemporary playwrights of Shakespeare's day, his family connections including the patrons of Shakespeare's [[First Folio]], his relationships with [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and Shakespeare's patron, the [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]], his knowledge of Court life, his private tutors and education, and his wide-ranging travels through the locations of Shakespeare's plays in France and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|pp=46, 47, 50, 53, 56, 58, 75, 78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case for Oxford's authorship is also based on perceived similarities between Oxford's biography and events in Shakespeare's plays, sonnets and longer poems; perceived parallels of language, idiom, and thought between Oxford's letters and the Shakespearean canon; and the discovery of numerous marked passages in Oxford's Bible that appear in some form in Shakespeare's plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=214}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to lay out a comprehensive case for Oxford's authorship was J. Thomas Looney, an English schoolteacher who identified personality characteristics in Shakespeare's works—especially ''Hamlet''—that painted the author as an eccentric aristocratic poet, a drama and sporting enthusiast with a classical education who had travelled extensively to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=431–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He discerned close affinities between the poetry of Oxford and that of Shakespeare in the use of motifs and subjects, phrasing, and rhetorical devices, which led him to identify Oxford as the author.&lt;ref name="may222" /&gt; After his ''Shakespeare Identified'' was published in 1920, Oxford replaced Bacon as the most popular alternative candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=121}}; {{Harvnb|McMichael|Glenn|1962|p=159}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=239 (210)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford's purported use of the "Shakespeare" pen name is attributed to the [[stigma of print]], a convention that aristocratic authors could not take credit for writing plays for the public stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another motivation given is the politically explosive "[[Prince Tudor theory]]" that the youthful Oxford was Queen Elizabeth's lover; according to this theory, Oxford dedicated ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'', ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', and the ''Sonnets'' to their son, England's rightful [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor Prince]], Henry Wriothesley, who was brought up as the 3rd Earl of Southampton.&lt;ref name="wadsworth127" /&gt;

Oxfordians say that the dedication to the sonnets published in 1609 implies that the author was dead prior to their publication and that 1604 (the year of Oxford's death) was the year regular publication of "newly corrected" and "augmented" Shakespeare plays stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bethell|1991|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they date most of the plays earlier than the standard chronology and say that the plays which show evidence of revision and collaboration were left unfinished by Oxford and completed by other playwrights after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=433–4}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=294 (258)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christopher Marlowe===
{{Main|Marlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship}}
[[File:Marlowe-Portrait-1585.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait with front view of a man with long hair, moustache, and arms folded, a putative portrait of Christopher Marlowe (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge).|[[Christopher Marlowe]] (1564–1593)]]

The poet and dramatist [[Christopher Marlowe]] was born into the same social class as Shakespeare—his father was a cobbler, Shakespeare's a glove-maker. Marlowe was the older by two months, and spent six and a half years at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. He pioneered the use of [[blank verse]] in Elizabethan drama, and his works are widely accepted as having greatly influenced those of Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Logan|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his seven plays, all but one or two were first performed before 1593.

The Marlovian theory argues that Marlowe's documented death on 30 May 1593 was faked. [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Thomas Walsingham]] and others are supposed to have arranged the faked death, the main purpose of which was to allow Marlowe to escape trial and almost certain execution on charges of subversive [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=445–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory then argues that Shakespeare was chosen as the front behind whom Marlowe would continue writing his highly successful plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1998|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These claims are founded on inferences derived from the circumstances of his apparent death, stylistic similarities between the works of Marlowe and Shakespeare, and hidden meanings found in the works and associated texts.

Marlovians note that, despite Marlowe and Shakespeare being almost exactly the same age, the first work linked to the name William Shakespeare—''Venus and Adonis''—was on sale, with his name signed to the dedication, 13 days after Marlowe's reported death,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1987|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; having been registered with the Stationers' Company on 18 April 1593 with no named author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|2000|p=xii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lists of verbal correspondences between the two canons have also been compiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|pp=446–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marlowe's candidacy was initially suggested by T. W. White, in 1892, as a member of a group of authors.&lt;ref name="Churchill 1958 44"&gt;{{harvnb|Churchill|1958|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was first proposed as the sole author of Shakespeare's "stronger plays" in 1895 by [[Wilbur G. Zeigler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoenbaum|1991|p=446}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His candidacy was revived by Calvin Hoffman in 1955 and, according to Shapiro, a recent surge in interest in the Marlowe case "may be a sign that the dominance of the Oxfordian camp may not extend much longer than the Baconian one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=247 (217)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby===
{{Main|Derbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship}}
[[File:6thEarlOfDerby.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait with front view of a man wearing a hat with feather.|[[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]] (1561–1642)]]
[[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]], was first proposed as a candidate in 1891 by James Greenstreet and later supported by Abel Lefranc and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wadsworth|1958|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenstreet discovered that a Jesuit spy, George Fenner, reported in 1599 that Derby "is busye in penning commodyes for the common players".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|pp=91–2}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=215 (189)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Derby was recorded as financing one of London's two children's drama companies, [[Children of Paul's|Paul's Boys]]; he also had his own company, Derby's Men, which played multiple times at court in 1600 and 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoone-Jongen|2008|pp=106, 164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Derby was born three years before Shakespeare and died in 1642, so his lifespan fits the consensus dating of the works. His initials were W. S., and he was known to sign himself "Will", which qualified him to write the punning "Will" sonnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=215 (190)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Derby travelled in continental Europe in 1582, visiting France and possibly [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. ''Love's Labour's Lost'' is set in Navarre and the play may be based on events that happened there between 1578 and 1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lefranc|1918–19|pp=2, 87–199}}; {{Harvnb|Wilson|1969|p=128}}; {{Harvnb|Londré|1997|p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Derby married [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth de Vere]], whose maternal grandfather was [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thought by some critics to be the basis of the character of Polonius in ''Hamlet''. Derby was associated with [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], and his brother [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert]], Earl of Montgomery and later 4th Earl of Pembroke, the "Incomparable Pair" to whom William Shakespeare's First Folio is dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibson|2005|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Derby released his estates to his son [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|James]] around 1628–29, he named Pembroke and Montgomery as trustees. Derby's older brother, [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], formed a group of players, the [[Lord Strange's Men]], some of whose members eventually joined the King's Men, one of the companies most associated with Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCrea|2005|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Julius von Ficker.jpg|thumb|Julius Ficker]]

The '''Sybel-Ficker controversy''' ({{lang-de|Sybel-Ficker-Streit}}) is the name given to a dispute in the second half of the 19th century between the historians [[Heinrich von Sybel]] (1817–1895) and [[Julius von Ficker]] (1826–1902). It involved a discussion concerning relations between Rome (that is, the [[Holy See|papal see]]) and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which also had an important bearing on the [[Austria–Prussia rivalry]]—whether Austria was to be part of a federal Germany, or whether Germany would continue without Austria (as a [[Lesser Germany]]).

Heinrich von Sybel fired the first shot in the dispute in an 1859 lecture, in which he condemned the medieval politics of the German Empire as "unnational". Julius Ficker countered in 1861 in lectures at the [[University of Innsbruck]], in which he justified the emperors' national politics, which he also presented as universal. While Sybel's was a "kleindeutsch-norddeutsch-protestantische" ([[Kleindeutschland|Little German]]-North German-Protestant) concept of history,&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schneider, 1940, p. 22. [[:de:Friedrich Schneider (Historiker)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ficker promoted a [[Greater Germany]] which would include Austria.

==Background==
The controversy's roots are in the [[Austria–Prussia rivalry]] which had grown more intense in the 18th century. Prussia, under Frederick the Great, had emerged as a major European power, and Sybel finds cause for the dispute in early 19th-century Prussian historiography. It continues with the [[founding of the German Empire]] under Bismarck in 1871, which had become possible with the Prussian victory over Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866. Historians have argued that it continued into the 20th century, with Hitler's ''[[Anschluss]]'' of 1938 as one high point.

The disagreement over the politics of the medieval Empire was important because those should determine the political direction and the national identity of the first national German state. Comments by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Giesebrecht]], who like Sybel was a student of [[Leopold von Ranke]], provoked Sybel into taking a public position. In his ''Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit'' (1855–1888), Giesebrecht wrote: "Moreover, the period of the Empire is the era whan our people, strengthened through unity, had risen to a position of power where it could not only freely determine its own fate, but could also commandeer other peoples, and where the German man exercised his greatest power in the world and the German name had the richest sound".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Giesebrecht: ''Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit.'' Volume 1: ''Gründung des Kaisertums.'' Braunschweig 1863 [first published 1855], page VI. Quote: "Überdies ist die Kaiserzeit die Periode, in der unser Volk, durch Einheit stark, zu seiner höchsten Machtentfaltung gedieh, wo es nicht allein frei über sein eigenes Schicksal verfügte, sondern auch anderen Völkern gebot, wo der deutsche Mann am meisten in der Welt galt und der deutsche Name den vollsten Klang hatte."&lt;/ref&gt; Sybel countered that throughout the period of the Empire, starting with [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]],  "national" interests had been betrayed while the Empire pursued interests in Italy, that its interest in the affairs of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] had led only to meaningless loss of life. This was different, according to Sybel, under Otto's father, [[Henry the Fowler]], but after him German politics were aimed in the wrong direction: "The powers of the nation, which at first and correctly following instinct had been directed toward the great colonization of the east, were afterwards aimed at an always alluring and always incorrect gleam of power south of the Alps.".&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, 1941, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sybel's position suggested the kind of imperialist thinking that found its expression in the famous ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' phrase and had become a reality in the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'', the migration and settlement of German-speaking peoples during the Holy Roman Empire. Sybel leaned on this development, even though it hadn't started under Heinrich I but rather in the 12th century, first past the [[Elbe]] and then across the [[Oder]], the settlement that had created [[Prussia]], [[Saxony]], and [[Silesia]] in Slavic areas. At the inception of the ''[[Alldeuscher Verband]]'', this movement was reiterated: "The old drive toward the East should be restored".&lt;ref&gt;Wippermann, 1981, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The development by [[Friedrich Ratzel]], in 1898, of the idea of ''Lebensraum'' supported this [[settler colonialism]], which came to be seen as an alternative for the transatlantic migration to America..
&lt;!--
Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg erfuhr mit der Gründung der osteuropäischen Nationalstaaten das Problem der dort lebenden „[[Volksdeutsche]]n“ zunehmend Aufmerksamkeit und beschäftigte Historiker, Geographen und Volkskundler. Mit dem [[Anschluss (Österreich)|Anschluss]] Österreichs ans deutsche Reich und der „Einverleibung“ des [[Sudetenland]]es vollzog [[Adolf Hitler]] dann mit breitester Zustimmung die ersten ostexpansiven Schritte, indem er zunächst die Eigenstaatlichkeit Österreichs und der Tschechoslowakei auflöste, bevor er weiter nach Osten ausgriff.

Friedrich Schneider dokumentierte und kommentierte aus großdeutscher Perspektive in 6 Auflagen von 1934 bis 1943 den Streit um die Kaiser- und Ostpolitik und separat die Sybel-Ficker-Kontroverse 1941. „In einer Zeit ungeheuerer geschichtlicher Ereignisse“ sah er, wie er 1940 schrieb, die Position Sybels in einer „gesamtdeutschen Geschichtsbetrachtung“ als aufgehoben und überholt an: „Österreich ist in das Reich heimgekehrt, Großdeutschland ist entstanden.“&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, 1940, S. V.&lt;/ref&gt; Auch von [[Albert Brackmann]] (1871–1952) heißt es, dass seine „Herausarbeitung der Abhängigkeit von Ost- und Italienpolitik […] den Streit um die Kaiserpolitik des Mittelalters überwunden“ habe.&lt;ref&gt;Bosl, Franz, Hofmann: ''Biographisches Wörterbuch zur deutschen Geschichte.'' Studienausgabe, Band 1, Augsburg 1995, S. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius von Ficker war in dieser Auseinandersetzung, in der es um machtpolitische Positionierung in der Gegenwart ging, chancenlos geblieben. Er hatte in seiner Entgegnung auf Sybel 1861 erläutert, dass mit Kategorien wie „national“ oder „deutsch“ die Wirklichkeit des 10. Jahrhunderts nicht beschrieben werden könne. „Nation“ sei deshalb ein unangemessener Begriff, weil die damaligen Reichsbewohner sich nicht als „Deutsche“, sondern als Angehörige der einzelnen „Stämme“ –&amp;nbsp;Sachsen, Franken, Bayern usw.&amp;nbsp;– verstanden hätten. Gegen Sybel, aber auch gegen Giesebrecht setzte er folgende Feststellung: „Das Reich aber, bei dessen Gründung Nationalbewusstsein den Ausschlag gegeben haben soll, wurde auch jetzt noch nicht als deutsches bezeichnet.“&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. J. v. Ficker: ''Das Deutsche Kaiserreich in seinen universalen und nationalen Beziehungen.'' 1861; in: Schneider, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Das bestätigt die moderne Auffassung, dass für diese Zeit des mittelalterlichen Reichs der Begriff gilt, unter dem es selbst in Erscheinung trat: [[Heiliges Römisches Reich]].

=== Sybels Standpunkt in Preußen, „Deutschösterreich“ und in Hitlers „Mein Kampf“ ===
Nach Sybels Einschätzung von 1859 ist die erst 1871 vollendete deutsche Nationalstaatsbildung nicht in Anlehnung an das 1806 aufgelöste Kaisertum zu bewerkstelligen. So lässt er seine Rede in einer rhetorischen Frage ausklingen: „Oder liegt sie“ (d. i. „die nationale Sache“) „nicht vielmehr auf gerade der entgegengesetzten Seite, wo Heinrich&amp;nbsp;I. und Heinrich der Löwe ihre große Laufbahn begannen, wo die [[Germanisierung]]  unserer östlichen Lande den vereinten Kräften aller deutschen Stämme gelang, wo Jahrhunderte hindurch in nationalem Glanze die Banner Bayerns, die Banner Wittelsbachs voranflogen?“

Wie sehr die Auseinandersetzung um die Kaiserpolitik die Gemüter bewegte, zeigte sich vor allen Dingen in Preußen: „Aber Sybel hat eben doch entscheidend dazu beigetragen, daß, um mit [[Ottokar Lorenz (Historiker)|Ottokar Lorenz]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Ottokar Lorenz|Ottokar Lorenz]].'' Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; zu reden (1902), von dem Augenblick, wo in der Literatur, selbst in der populären, das deutsche Kaisertum von den preußisch gerichteten Politikern als etwas Abgetanes, Fremdes, Antinationales, in vielem Betracht Schädliches erkannt worden sei, es kaum einen Schüler oder Schulmeister gegeben habe, der nicht mündlich oder schriftlich versicherte, daß es schwerlich Unglückseligeres und Widerwärtigeres in unserer deutschen Vergangenheit gegeben habe als das Kaisertum.“&lt;ref&gt;So der Ficker-Schüler Julius Jung, vgl. Schneider, 1941, S. XXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aber die Position Sybels fand auch erhebliches Gehör in [[Deutschösterreich]], wobei allerdings Otto&amp;nbsp;I. als „Gründer der Ostmark“ (= das spätere Österreich) ausgenommen wurde, und prägte z.&amp;nbsp;B. das Geschichtsbild von [[Richard Suchenwirth]] in seiner seit 1934 in jährlichen Neuauflagen verbreiteten „Deutschen Geschichte“,&lt;ref&gt;Suchenwirths Wertung der Italienpolitik Ottos&amp;nbsp;I. sieht einschließlich Ehrenrettung gegenüber Sybel so aus: „Allerdings sind die deutschen Stämme auf diesen Zügen nach dem Süden erst recht zu einer Einheit zusammengewachsen. Aber das wäre auch gegen die Slawen und Magyaren möglich gewesen und hätte hier dauernden Gewinn gebracht. So aber haben wir im Mittelalter den winkenden Siegespreis verscherzt. Otto selbst hat ja in beider Hinsicht seinen Mann gestanden, und wenn auch die Zukunft nur einen Teil der Verheißungen von 955 erfüllte, so stehen doch die Ostmark Österreich und im Grunde auch die spätere Mark Brandenburg auf den Schultern des von diesem Kaiser Errungenen. So weist sein Werk überall weit über seine Zeit hinaus.“(Richard Suchenwirth, Deutsche Geschichte. Von der germanischen Vorzeit bis zur Gegenwart, Leipzig 1935, S. 115.)&lt;/ref&gt; folgenreicher aber das von Adolf Hitler:
{{Zitat
 |Text=Wenn wir […] die politischen Erlebnisse unseres Volkes seit über tausend Jahren überprüfen, […] und das […] heute vor uns liegende Endresultat untersuchen, so werden wir gestehen müssen, dass aus diesem Blutmeer eigentlich nur drei Erscheinungen hervorgegangen sind, die wir als bleibende Früchte klar bestimmter außenpolitischer und überhaupt politischer Vorgänge ansprechen dürfen:
# die hauptsächlich von Bajuwaren betätigte Kolonisation der Ostmark,
# die Erwerbung und Durchdringung des Gebietes östlich der Elbe, und
# die von den Hohenzollern betätigte Organisation des brandenburgisch-preußischen Staates als Vorbild und Kristallisationskern eines neuen Reiches.&amp;nbsp;[…]
Jene beiden ersten großen Erfolge unserer Außenpolitik sind die dauerhaftesten geblieben. […] Und es muss als wahrhaft verhängnisvoll angesehen werden, dass unsere deutsche Geschichtsschreibung diese beiden weitaus gewaltigsten und für die Nachwelt bedeutungsvollsten Leistungen nie richtig zu würdigen verstand. […] Wir schwärmen auch heute noch von einem Heroismus, der unserem Volke Millionen seiner edelsten Blutträger raubte, im Endergebnis jedoch vollkommen unfruchtbar blieb.&amp;nbsp;[…]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''Wir setzen dort an, wo man vor sechs Jahrhunderten endete. Wir stoppen den ewigen Germanenzug nach dem Süden und Westen Europas und weisen den Blick nach dem Osten.''
 |ref=&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler: ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. Zweiter Band, ''Die nationalsozialistische Bewegung''. München 1933, S.&amp;nbsp;733–742. (Der letzte Satz ist im Original fett gedruckt und hervorgehoben.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Technology society and life''' or '''technology and culture''' refers to cyclical co-dependence, co-influence, and co-production of [[technology]] and [[society]] upon the other (technology upon culture, and vice versa). This synergistic relationship occurred from the dawn of humankind, with the invention of simple tools and continues into modern technologies such as the [[printing press]] and [[computer]]s. The academic discipline studying the impacts of science, technology, and society, and vice versa is called [[science and technology studies]].

==Pre-historical==
The importance of [[stone tool]]s, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the [[hunting hypothesis]].

Primatologist, [[Richard Wrangham]], theorizes that the [[control of fire by early humans]] and the associated development of [[cooking]] was the spark that radically changed human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

==Modern examples and effects==
Technology has become a huge part in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this technology becomes part of the society.The use of technology in education provides students with technology literacy, information literacy, capacity for life-long learning and other skills necessary for the 21st century workplace. &lt;ref name=Puricelli&gt;{{harv|Puricelli|2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital technology]] has entered each process and activity made by the [[social system]]. In fact, it constructed another worldwide [[communication system]] in addition to its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rückriem|2009|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 study by ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a technology assessment study by the [[Institute for the Future]], "peering into the future of an electronic world." The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way videotex service by the end of the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.

Since the creation of [[computer]]s achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store [[data]]. Digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by [[DVD]]s or purchasing it online.
Digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media. Obviously, because [[digital media|digital]] ones are reproducible, portable and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|2010|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states started to implement education technology in schools, universities and colleges. According to the statistics, in the early beginnings of 1990s the use of Internet in schools was ,on average, 2-3%. Continuously, by the end of 1990s the evolution of technology increases rapidly and reaches to 60%, and by the year of 2008 nearly 100% of schools use Internet on educational form. According to ISTE researchers, technological improvements can lead to numerous achievements in classrooms. E-learning system, collaboration of students on project based learning, and technological skills for future results in motivation of students. 

Although these previous examples only show a few of the positive aspects of technology in society, there are negative side effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lynden|first1 = Burke|title = Generation Y Heavily Dependent On Technology, Promotes Laziness|url = http://www.thejambar.com/generation-y-heavily-dependent-on-technology-promotes-laziness/|website = The Jambar|accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this virtual realm, social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Instagram|Facebook]], and [[Snapchat]] have altered the way [[Millennials|Generation Y culture]] is understanding the world and thus how they view themselves. In recent years, there has been more research on the development of social media depression in users of sites like these. "Facebook Depression" is when users are so affected by their friends' posts and lives that their own jealousy depletes their sense of self-worth. They compare themselves to the posts made by their peers and feel unworthy or monotonous because they feel like their lives are not nearly as exciting as the lives of others.&lt;ref name=Puricelli/&gt;

Another instance of the negative effects of technology in society, is how quickly it is pushing younger generations into maturity. With the world at their fingertips, children can learn anything they wish to. But with the uncensored sources from the [[internet]], without proper supervision, children can be exposed to explicit material at inappropriate ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woollaston|first1=Victoria|title=Kids ARE growing up faster today - and it's all down to technology|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2834559/Kids-growing-faster-today-s-technology-Facebook-mobile-phones-causing-young-people-mature-quickly-poll-reveals.html|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes in the forms of premature interests in experimenting with makeup or opening an email account or social media page—all of which can become a window for predators and other dangerous entities that threaten a child's innocence. Technology has a serious effect on youth's health. The overuse of technology is said to be associated with sleep deprivation which is linked to obesity and poor academic performance in the lives of adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi med J. 2016 pages 436-439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and technological development==
[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Nuclear reactor, [[Doel]], [[Belgium]]]]

In ancient history, [[economics]] began when spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures. Makers of arrowheads, for example, might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs. Regardless of goods and services bartered, some amount of technology was involved&amp;mdash;if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry. Even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology. So, from the very beginnings, technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies.Technology is seen as primary source in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina. [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''] {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advancement and economic growth are related to each other.The level of technology is important to determine the economic growth.It is the technological process which keeps the economy moving.

In the modern world, superior technologies, resources, geography, and history give rise to robust economies; and in a well-functioning, robust economy, economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology. Moreover, because technology is such an inseparable part of human society, especially in its economic aspects, funding sources for (new) technological endeavors are virtually illimitable. However, while in the beginning, technological investment involved little more than the time, efforts, and skills of one or a few men, today, such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions.

===Funding===
Consequently, the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed, since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society, or even a large part. It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental (involving whole, or nearly whole, social [[Organization|enterprises]]) and private (involving more limited, but generally more sharply focused) business or individual enterprises.

====Government funding for new technology====
The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways. In the United States alone, many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology.

[In 1980, the UK government invested just over six million pounds in a four-year program, later extended to six years, called the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] (MEP), which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer, software, training materials, and extensive teacher training. Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world.]

Technology has frequently been driven by the military, with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use. However, this has always been a two-way flow, with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military.

Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research, such as America's [[National Science Foundation]], the United Kingdom's [[List of UK government scientific research institutes|scientific research institutes]], America's [[Small Business Innovation Research|Small Business Innovative Research]] effort. Many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development.

====Private funding====
[[Research and development]] is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology.
&lt;!--source needed--&gt;

Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology. In the [[OECD]], about two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 98 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by [[University|universities]] and government. But in poorer countries such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly less. The U.S. government spends more than other countries on military research and development, although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051956/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |date=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 founding of [[Kickstarter]] allows individuals to receive funding via [[crowdsourcing]] for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries, films, and webseries that focus on [[technology management]]. This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds.

===Other economic considerations===
* [[Appropriate technology]], sometimes called "intermediate" technology, more of [[Index of economics articles|an economics concern]], refers to compromises between central and expensive technologies of [[Developed country|developed nations]] and those that [[Developing country|developing nations]] find most effective to deploy given an excess of labour and scarcity of cash.
*[[Persuasive technology|Persuasion technology]]: In [[economics]], definitions or assumptions of progress or [[economic growth|growth]] are often related to one or more assumptions about technology's economic influence. Challenging prevailing assumptions about technology and its usefulness has led to alternative ideas like [[uneconomic growth]] or [[Quality of life|measuring well-being]]. These, and economics itself, can often be described as technologies, specifically, as persuasion technology.

==Sociological factors and effects==
{{See also|Social construction of technology}}

===Values===
The implementation of technology influences the [[Value (ethics)#Personal and cultural values|values]] of a society by changing expectations and realities. The implementation of technology is also influenced by values. There are (at least) three major, interrelated values that inform, and are informed by, technological innovations:
*[[Mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanistic world view]]: Viewing the universe as a collection of parts (like a machine), that can be individually analyzed and understood.&lt;ref name = McGinn&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[reductionism]] that is rare nowadays. However, the "neo-mechanistic world view" holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect. Also, while all things are greater than the sum of their parts (e.g., even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination), in principle, even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence. That is, no [[Divinity|divine]] or [[Vitalism|vital]] principle or essence is involved.
*[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]]: A value, originally applied only to machines, but now applied to all aspects of society, so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance, output, or ability.
*Social [[progress]]: The belief that there is such a thing as social progress, and that, in the main, it is beneficent. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the subsequent explosion of technology, almost all societies believed in a [[cyclical theory]] of social movement and, indeed, of all history and the universe. This was, obviously, based on the cyclicity of the seasons, and an agricultural economy's and society's strong ties to that cyclicity. Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots, they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history. This may be seen, for example, in Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar's modern social cycles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metafuture.org/sarkar/prabhat.htm | title=Prabhat rainjan sarkar's social cycles, world unity and peace; Renaissance 2000 honoring Sarkar's 75th Anniversary, LA 1 | work=Metafuture.org | accessdate=July 6, 2016 | author=Galtung, Johan}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a more westernized version of social cyclicity, see ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069'' (Paperback) by Neil Howe and William Strauss; Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (September 30, 1992); {{ISBN|0-688-11912-3}}, and subsequent books by these authors.

====Institutions and groups====
Technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible. Examples of this might include:
*The rise of very large organizations: e.g., governments, the military, health and social welfare institutions, supranational corporations.
*The commercialization of leisure: sports events, products, etc. (McGinn)
*The almost instantaneous dispersal of information (especially news) and entertainment around the world.

===International===
Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues, values, and cultures. Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media, the world seems to be a much smaller place, due to the following:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
*Globalization of ideas
*Embeddedness of values
*Population growth and control

==Environment==
{{Main article|Environmental technology}}
Technology provides an understanding, and an appreciation for the world around us.

Most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products, which is known as industrial waste and pollution. While most material waste is re-used in the industrial process, many forms are released into the environment, with negative environmental side effects, such as pollution and lack of sustainability. Different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution. Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind, but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects. Historically, the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society, because once people are able to provide for their basic needs, they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water.

The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle. The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (such as petroleum, coal, ores), and the added [[pollution]] of air, water, and land. The more subtle effects include debates over long-term effects (e.g., global warming, deforestation, natural habitat destruction, coastal wetland loss.)

Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans: [[toxic waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[electronic waste]].

One of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently. In nature, organisms "recycle" the wastes of other organisms, for example, plants produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen-breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food, producing carbon dioxide as a by-product, which plants use in a process to make sugar, with oxygen as a waste in the first place. No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes.

==Construction and shaping==

===Choice===
Society also controls technology through the choices it makes. These choices not only include consumer demands; they also include:
*the channels of distribution, how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal;
*the cultural beliefs regarding style, freedom of choice, consumerism, materialism, etc.;
*the economic values we place on the environment, individual wealth, government control, capitalism, etc.

According to Williams and Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Williams|Edge|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice (and not necessarily conscious choice). Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the making of those artifacts and systems.

The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, technology could be a garden of forking paths, with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes. This is a position that has been developed in detail by [[Judy Wajcman]]. Therefore, choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

===Autonomous technology===
In one line of thought, technology develops autonomously, in other words, technology seems to feed on itself, moving forward with a force irresistible by humans. To these individuals, technology is "inherently dynamic and self-augmenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Ellul]] is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans. He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities. However, he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent. But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes.

[[Langdon Winner]] critiques the idea that [[Radovan Richta|technological evolution]] is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology. He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of "technological somnambulism," the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects.

===Government===
Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology.
*Supposed independence of government. An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent. However, some argue that governing is a political process, so government will be influenced by political winds of influence. In addition, because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development, it has a vested interest in certain outcomes. Other point out that the world's biggest ecological disasters, such as the [[Aral Sea]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Lake Karachay]] have been caused by government projects, which are not accountable to consumers.
*Liability. One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm. Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages.
*Legislation. A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment. While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people, there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts, and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments.

Recently, the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[e-social science]] in the United Kingdom, which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of [[Science and technology studies|science and technology]] a central part of their funding programs.

'''''The Heartland Series''''' is a series of [[television program]]s about the culture of [[Appalachia]], produced by [[WBIR-TV]] of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], over the 25-year period 1984 through 2009. The series has been produced on a limited basis since 2010.

==Production history==
''The Heartland Series'' was conceived in 1984 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] with a special series celebrating the people and land of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; Actor [[Bill Landry]] was hired to host the series.

The TV series was initially scheduled to run for just three months.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;Leean Tupper, [http://www.oakridger.com/localnews/x2121669764/Goodbye-Heartland-Series-melded-the-generations Goodbye: 'Heartland Series' melded the generations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928025646/http://www.oakridger.com/localnews/x2121669764/Goodbye-Heartland-Series-melded-the-generations |date=2011-09-28 }}, ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', August 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Landry, the original concept, formed by WBIR creative services director Steve Dean and station general manager Jim Hart, was "to take a [[video camera|camera]] and interview the last remnants of the old mountain people and go on location.”&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; Each episode was three minutes and 40 seconds long,&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; designed to air in five-minute time slots during and after daily news broadcasts.

The series continued past the short run that was originally planned. Subject matter included [[geology]], wildlife, native plants, [[invasive species]], and other aspects of the region's [[natural history]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lifeways and [[archeology]], re-enactments and remembrances of historical events ranging from events in the [[American Revolutionary War]] to [[coal mining]] disasters and the early years of TVA, and feature stories about regional culture.&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/wbir_stops_prod.shtml WBIR stops production of 'The Heartland Series'], Tele-Buddy's Tinseltown Tales, knoxnews.com, February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his work on the series, host Bill Landry told an interviewer that he had learned to “[[Tanning (leather)|tan hides]], make jelly butter, saw logs, eat tree bark, carve [[soapstone]], build a [[log cabin]], cut timber, run a [[sawmill]], make [[moonshine]], [[Horseshoe|shoe a horse]], call a [[barred owl|hoot owl]], [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] like a [[deer]] and know when the [[American bison|buffalo]] runs.”&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt; Traditional music was a perennial topic, including performances by and interviews with traditional musicians active in East Tennessee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=3&amp;StoryID=31 A Music Tale], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=1 Hardware Pickers], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrations by craftsmen who make musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=6&amp;StoryID=15 Artist in Residence - Fiddle Making], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and exploration of musical traditions such as [[old harp singing]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=2&amp;StoryID=17 Singing the Old Harp], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Scottish and Irish influences on the region's music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=7&amp;StoryID=10 Ballads in Time], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Two topics that the series generally avoided were [[politics]] and controversial religious practices such as [[snake handling]].&lt;ref name=Smyser&gt;Dick Smyser, Short takes and tall tales from Bill Landry's 'Heartland', ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', November 10, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Smokies national park, on-scene production locations in East Tennessee included the [[Museum of Appalachia]], where several episodes were taped, including the titles "1791," "Just Another Day," "The Music Tale," "The Toggins," "Frontier Music, Frontier Foods," and "Gift for Jacob,"&lt;ref name=Tupper/&gt; [[Rugby, Tennessee|Rugby]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=4&amp;StoryID=25 The Glory of Rugby], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roan Mountain State Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=28 Roan Mountain Pilgrimage], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Savage Gulf State Natural Area]] in [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=4 Wilderness Spared], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=2 Hensley], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Landry's skill as an [[interview]]er has been remarked upon by many observers. His folksy, rambling style made him effective at putting people at ease and drawing out the interesting stories of the people that he encountered in the "hills, hollows, small towns and major cities" of Appalachia.&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smyser/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venable/&gt;

In 1998, the series was expanded to include a 30-minute version airing each Saturday at 7:00 p.m., while it continued to run the original five-minute version during the morning news, after ''10 News at Noon'', and after ''10 News Nightbeat''.&lt;ref name=AboutLandry&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/b_landry.aspx About Bill Landry], WBIR website, accessed October 6, 1009&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of production===
In February 2009, WBIR announced plans to suspend production of the series in September 2009 after taking it "through to some sort of conclusion."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; WBIR general manager Jeff Lee cited economics as the reason for ending production, noting "it is a luxury for three people to produce 3-1/2 minutes of TV a week."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt; He said that the station would continue to show the hundreds of episodes already produced "for as long as the viewers like them."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; More than 3,000 people signed an online [[petition]] asking for the series to be continued, but WBIR followed through with its plan to end it.&lt;ref name=Morrowprime/&gt; The last episode was taped at the [[Museum of Appalachia]] in [[Norris, Tennessee|Norris]] on August 8, 2009 before an audience estimated at 10,000 people, one of the largest crowds in the museum's history.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrowfans&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/08/10000_fans_turn.shtml 10,000 fans turn out for last 'Heartland Series' taping] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019224041/http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/08/10000_fans_turn.shtml |date=2009-10-19 }}, Knoxnews.com, August 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; People seeking Landry's [[autograph]] waited in line for an hour.&lt;ref name=Morrowfans/&gt; The final show featured several [[Appalachian traditional music]]ians who had appeared previously in the series, including [[fiddler]] [[Danny Gammon]], [[Bobby Fulcher]], [[Tony Thomas (bluegrass musician)|Tony Thomas]] and [[Jimmy McCarroll]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Fred Brown, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/aug/09/heartland-says-goodbye/  'Heartland Series' says goodbye; Many turn out to celebrate longtime WBIR series], Knoxville News Sentinel, August 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The last episode was scheduled for broadcast as an hour-long special on September 19, 2009, but  to avoid conflict with a [[Tennessee Volunteers]] football game the broadcast was postponed and rescheduled to be shown in a [[prime time]] slot at 8:00 p.m. on October 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/09/wbir_sets_date.shtml WBIR sets date for 'Heartland Series' finale], KnoxNews.com, September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/09/heartland_serie.shtml 'Heartland Series' finale postponed], KnoxNews.com, September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrowprime&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/10/heartland_serie_1.shtml 'Heartland Series' finale to go primetime], KnoxNews.com, October 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===

Public response to the cancellation of the series caused management to reconsider its demise. In 2010 producer Steve Dean was contracted to produce four more episodes, each an hour long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=116170 New Heartland Series program to air in March], WBIR-TV website, March 17, 2010.

'''''The Passover Plot''''' is a 1965 [[conspiracy theory]] book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schonfield |first=Hugh Joseph |authorlink=Hugh J. Schonfield |title=The Passover Plot: a New Interpretation of the Life and Death of Jesus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrhk5B3AQocC |format=snippets view |accessdate= |year=1965 |edition=1996 reprint |publisher=Element |location= |isbn=9781852308360 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by British [[Bible|biblical]] scholar [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], who also published a translation of the [[New Testament]] with a Jewish perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tyndalearchive.com/scriptures/ONT.htm ''The Original New Testament''] (originally published in 1958 as ''The Authentic New Testament'', updated and re-published under this title in 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted into a film, ''[[The Passover Plot (film)|The Passover Plot]]'' (1976).

==Schonfield's conclusions==
Based on his research into the social and religious culture in which [[Jesus]] was born, lived and died, and into other literature, including the source documents of the [[Gospel]]s, Schonfield reached the following conclusions:
* That Jesus was a deeply religious [[Jew]]ish man, probably well-versed in the teachings of the local northern sects such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]s and [[Essenes]].
* That growing up in biblical [[Galilee]] he had a skeptical and somewhat rebellious relationship to the hierarchy and teachings mandated by the authorities (the [[Saducee]]s) of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]].
* That Jewish [[Messiah|Messianic]] expectation was extremely high in those times, matched to the despair caused by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of the land and subjugation of the Jews.
* That he was in many ways both typical of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|his times]], and yet extraordinary in his religious convictions and beliefs, in his scholarship of the biblical literature, and in the fervency in which he lived his religion out in his daily life.
* That he was convinced of his role as the expected Messiah based on the authority of his having been descendant from [[David|King David]] (the [[Davidic line|royal bloodline of David]]), and that he consciously and methodically, to the point of being calculating, attempted to fulfill that role, being eminently well-versed in the details of what that role entailed.
* That he was convinced of the importance of his fulfilling the role perfectly (after all prophesy and expectation), and that he could not allow himself to fail, as that would undoubtedly lead to his being declared a [[False messiah|false Messiah]].
* That he was perfectly aware of the consequences of his actions all along the way, and that he directed his closest supporters, the original twelve [[Apostles]], unknowingly to aid him in his plans.
* That he involved the least possible number of supporters in his plans ("[[need to know]]" basis), therefore very few knew of the details of his final plan, and even then only the least amount of information necessary.&lt;ref name="Schaefer2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry F. Schaefer|title=Science and Christianity: Conflict Or Coherence?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g67eEE-t5TIC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=1 July 2003|publisher=The Apollos Trust|isbn=978-0-9742975-0-7|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culmination of his plan was to be his death (the [[crucifixion]]), his [[resurrection]] and his reign as the true kingly and priestly messiah, not in heaven but on earth—the realized king of the Jews.

==Planning==
According to Schonfield's analysis, the events of the Passover, which are presented in all the Gospels, but inconsistently, are most accurately presented in the Gospel of John. His reading of that Gospel convinced him that John's account, though probably filtered through an assistant and transcription in John's old age, suggests that Jesus had planned everything. Among other things, so that he would not be on the cross for more than a few hours before the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] arrived when it was required by law that Jews be taken down, so that one of his supporters, who was on hand, would give him water (to quench his thirst) that was actually laced with a drug to make him unconscious, and so that [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a well-connected supporter, would collect him off the cross while still alive (but appearing dead) so that he could be secretly nursed back to health. Schonfield suggests that the plan went awry because of a soldier's actions with a spear. Schonfield gives evidence of a high-ranking member of the Sanhedrin who was one of Jesus' followers, likely the [[Beloved Disciple]] who is otherwise obscure, and notes several instances in which knowledge of or access to the Temple was available to one or more of Jesus' followers. He identifies this follower as John, the source of the Gospel many decades later whilst living in Asia Minor. He suggests that this Apostle, and Joseph of Arimathea, were responsible for events following the Crucifixion, and that it might have been this Apostle (an 'undercover Disciple', as it were) who was seen (by those who did not know him) at the Tomb on the morning of the Resurrection.&lt;ref name="Habermas1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary R. Habermas|title=The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMMeqKHZIDkC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=1 June 1996|publisher=College Press|isbn=978-0-89900-732-8|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second half of the book==
After first laying out the storyline and outcome of Jesus' life in the first half of the book, along with supportive arguments, Schonfield devotes the second half of the book to a more detailed explanation of the concepts and arguments used to support his conclusions.  Schonfield also discusses how Jesus' original message and purpose may have become transformed during the century after his death.

==Film based on book==
{{Main article|The Passover Plot (film)}}
''[[The Passover Plot (film)|The Passover Plot]]'' is the name of a 1976 film which was adapted from this book.  The movie starred [[Zalman King]] as ''Yeshua'' ([[Jesus]]), and the cast included [[Harry Andrews]], [[Dan Hedaya]], and [[Donald Pleasence]].  It was directed by [[Michael Campus]] and nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Best Costume Design. Schonfield also featured in the dramatised documentary television series, ''Jesus: The Evidence'' (1984: LWT for Channel 4).

'''''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''''' ({{lang-de|Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus}}) is a book written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[sociologist]], economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="WeberBaehr2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Weber|author2=Peter R. Baehr|author3=Gordon C. Wells|title=The Protestant ethic and the "spirit" of capitalism and other writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MmligHndssC|accessdate=21 August 2011|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-043921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a founding text in [[economic sociology]] and [[sociology]] in general.

In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in [[Northern Europe]] evolved when the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprise]]s and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = AM | year = 2010 | title = Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism | url = http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sociological Theory | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 108–126 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01367.x| hdl = 2164/3035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses [[Lutherans]] (especially [[Pietists]], but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), [[Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Moravians]] (specifically referring to the [[Herrnhut]]-based community under [[Count von Zinzendorf]]'s spiritual lead).

==Summary==

===Basic concepts===
Although not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber's later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]],'' ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]],'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]),'' ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' argues that [[Puritan]] [[ethic]]s and [[idea]]s influenced the development of capitalism. The 'spirit of capitalism' does not refer to the spirit in the metaphysical sense but rather a set of values, the spirit of hard work and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Michael Shea |url=http://discoversociety.org/2015/10/06/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-language-of-austerity/ |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Language of Austerity |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=[[Discover Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions. To illustrate his theory, Weber quotes the ethical writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]]:

{{quote|sign=|source=|Remember, that ''time is money''.  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon ''that'' the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides. [...] Remember, that money is the ''prolific, generating nature''. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on. Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding feline taint, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.}}

Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. Indeed, Franklin claims that God revealed the usefulness of virtue to him.&lt;ref name="protestant"&gt;Weber, Max "The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–12}}

The Reformation profoundly affected the view of work, dignifying even the most mundane professions as adding to the common good and thus blessed by God, as much as any "sacred" calling (German: ''Ruf''). A common illustration is that of a cobbler, hunched over his work, who devotes his entire effort to the praise of God.

To emphasize the [[work ethic]] in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending ''less'' time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

It is particularly advantageous in technical occupations for workers to be extremely devoted to their craft.  To view the craft as an end in itself, or as a "calling" would serve this need well. This attitude is well-noted in certain classes which have endured religious education, especially of a [[Pietist]] background.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

He defines spirit of capitalism as the ideas and ''esprit'' that favour the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational]] pursuit of [[Wealth|economic gain]]: "We shall nevertheless provisionally use the expression 'spirit of capitalism' for that attitude which, ''in the pursuit of a calling [berufsmäßig]'', strives systematically for profit for its own sake in the manner exemplified by Benjamin Franklin."&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

Weber points out that such a [[spirit]] is not limited to [[Western culture]] if one considers it as the attitude of [[Person|individual]]s, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as he calls them – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'',  University of California Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|55}} As he wrote in his essays:

:{{quote|In order that a manner of life well adapted to the peculiarities of the capitalism… could come to dominate others, it had to originate somewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to the whole groups of man.}}

After defining the "spirit of capitalism," Weber argues that there are many reasons to find its origins in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many others like [[William Petty]], [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[John Keats]] have noted the [[Affinity (sociology)|affinity]] between Protestantism and the development of [[commercialism]].&lt;ref name="Bendix54"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber shows that certain branches of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. This recognition was not a goal in itself; rather they were a byproduct of other doctrines of faith that encouraged planning, hard work and self-denial in the pursuit of worldly riches.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

===Origins of the Protestant work ethic===

Weber traced the origins of the Protestant ethic to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], though he acknowledged some respect for secular everyday labor as early as the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|28}} The Roman Catholic Church assured salvation to individuals who accepted the church's sacraments and submitted to the clerical authority. However, the Reformation had effectively removed such assurances. From a [[psychological]] viewpoint, the average person had difficulty adjusting to this new worldview, and only the most devout believers or "religious geniuses" within Protestantism, such as [[Martin Luther]], were able to make this adjustment, according to Weber.

In the absence of such assurances from religious authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other "signs" that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of [[Predestination|double predestination]], in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one's own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin's followers. It became an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation, and to dispel any doubt about that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation. So, self-confidence took the place of priestly assurance of God's grace.

Worldly success became one measure of that self-confidence. Luther made an early endorsement of Europe's emerging divisions. Weber identifies the applicability of Luther's conclusions, noting that a "vocation" from God was no longer limited to the clergy or church, but applied to any occupation or trade. Weber had always detested Lutheranism for the servility it inspired toward the bureaucratic state. When he discussed it in the ''Protestant Ethic'', he used Lutheranism as the chief example of the ''[[unio mystica]]'' that contrasted sharply with the ascetic posture. Later he would associate "Luther, the symbolic exponent of [[bureaucratic despotism]], with the ascetic hostility to [[Eros]] — an example of Weber's sporadic tendency to link together bureaucratic and ascetic modes of life and to oppose both from mystical and aristocratic perspectives."&lt;ref name="Mitzman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mitzman|title=The Iron Cage: An Historical Interpretation of Max Weber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mayilngcerQC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1970|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3745-3|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Weber saw the fulfillment of the Protestant ethic not in [[Lutheranism]], which was too concerned with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] forms of Christianity.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}} The trend was carried further still in Pietism.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|90}} The [[Baptists]] diluted the concept of the calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop ''un''politically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|102–104}}

What Weber argued, in simple terms:
* According to the new Protestant religions, an individual was religiously compelled to follow a secular vocation (German: ''Beruf'') with as much zeal as possible. A person living according to this world view was more likely to accumulate money.
* The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully ''using'' hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries as a [[sin]]. Donations to an individual's church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of [[icon]]s. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their fellow man, and an affront to God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.

The manner in which this paradox was resolved, Weber argued, was the investment of this money, which gave an extreme boost to [[Primitive accumulation|nascent capitalism]].

===The Protestant work ethic in Weber's time===

By the time Weber wrote his essay, he believed that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]], which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and furniture, that industrialization offered.

In his remarkably prescient conclusion to the book, Weber lamented that the loss of religious underpinning to capitalism's spirit has led to a kind of involuntary servitude to mechanized industry.

{{quote|The Puritan wanted to work in calling; we are forced to do so.  For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order.  This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force.  Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the 'saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.' But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage. (Page 181, 1953 Scribner's edition.)}}

Weber maintained that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted the development of economic system in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and [[observation]], the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, and an increase in entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], that ''disenchantment of the world'' that could be seen as a unique characteristic of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Conclusions===

In the final endnotes Weber states that he abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional [[theology|theologian]], had begun work on ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area, which is laying groundwork for comparative analysis of religion and society. Weber moved beyond Protestantism with his research but would continue research into [[sociology of religion]] within his later works (the study of [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Judaism]] and the religions of [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|China]] and [[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Budhism|India]]).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"/&gt;{{rp|49}}

This book is also Weber's first brush with the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]. His idea of modern capitalism as growing out of the religious pursuit of wealth meant a change to a rational means of existence, wealth. That is to say, at some point the Calvinist rationale informing the "spirit" of capitalism became unreliant on the underlying religious movement behind it, leaving only rational capitalism. In essence then, Weber's "Spirit of Capitalism" is effectively and more broadly a Spirit of Rationalization.

==Reception==
The essay can also be interpreted as one of Weber's criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] and his theories. While Marx's [[historical materialism]] held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen ''The Protestant Ethic'' as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, not the other way around.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other scholars have taken a more nuanced view of Weber's argument. Weber states in the closing of this essay, "it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes equally little in the interest of historical truth." Weber's argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of 'material; and 'ideal' factors.&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Economic criticism===
The economist and historian [[Henryk Grossman]] criticises Weber's analysis on two fronts, firstly with reference to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s extensive work which showed that the stringent legal measures taken against poverty and vagabondage was a reaction to the massive population shifts caused by the [[enclosure]] of the [[commons]] in England.  And, secondly, in Grossman's own work showing how this "bloody legislation" against those who had been put off their land was effected across Europe and especially in France.  For Grossman this legislation, the outlawing of [[idleness]] and the [[poorhouses]] they instituted physically forced people from [[serfdom]] into [[wage-labor]].  For him, this general fact was not related to Protestantism and so capitalism came largely by force and not by any vocational training regarding an inner-worldliness of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Henryk (2006) ‘The Beginnings of Capitalism and the New Mass Morality’ Journal of Classical Sociology 6 (2): July&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that the Protestant "work ethic" reinforced or legitimized these legal measures within a larger cultural context.

In a paper published on 10 November 2009, Harvard economist Davide Cantoni tested Weber's Protestant hypothesis using population and economic growth in second-millennium Germany as the data set, with negative results. Cantoni writes:

{{quote|Using population figures in a dataset comprising 276 cities in the years 1300–1900, I find no effects of Protestantism on economic growth. The finding is robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls, and does not appear to depend on data selection or small sample size. In addition, Protestantism has no effect when interacted with other likely determinants of economic development. I also analyze the endogeneity of religious choice; instrumental variables estimates of the effects of Protestantism are similar to the OLS results.&lt;ref&gt;David Cantoni, "The Economic Effects of the Protestant Reformation: Testing the Weber Hypothesis in the German Lands," November 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205143318/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |archivedate=5 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Cantoni uses city size, and not relative real wage growth, which was the Weber thesis, as his "main dependent variable" (Cantoni, 2).

Other recent scholarship continues to find valid Protestant Ethic effects both in historical and contemporary development patterns.

Dudley and Blum write:
{{quote|Evidence of falling wages in Catholic cities and rising wages in Protestant cities between 1500 and 1750, during the spread of literacy in the vernacular, is inconsistent with most theoretical models of economic growth. In The Protestant Ethic, Weber suggested an alternative explanation based on culture. Here, a theoretical model confirms that a small change in the subjective cost of cooperating with strangers can generate a profound transformation in trading networks. In explaining urban growth in early-modern Europe, specifications compatible with human-capital versions of the neoclassical model and endogenous-growth theory are rejected in favor of a "small-world" formulation based on the Weber thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807123042/http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archivedate=2003-08-07  |title=Religion and Economic Growth: Was Weber Right? |first1=Ulrich |last1=Blum |first2=Leonard |last2=Dudley |date=February 2001 |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=207–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Revisionist criticism===
H. M. Robertson, in his book ''Aspects of Economic Individualism'', argued against the historical and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, a decidedly different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to [[Adam Smith]], the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.

Looking at the history of the development of economic thought, Robertson shows that Adam Smith and [[David Ricardo]] did not found economic science ''de novo''. In fact, liberal economic theory was developed by French and Italian Catholics, who were influenced by the [[Scholastics]]. The British economic thought was rather a step backwards since it espoused the [[Labor Theory of Value]], which had already been proved incorrect by the [[School of Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313191910/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-13 |title=Catholicism, Protestantism, and Capitalism |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |author-link=Murray Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=February 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===
It has recently been suggested that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" but rather through the promotion of literacy.&lt;ref name="urss.ru"&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]). P.87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker and Wossmann at the University of Munich,&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"&gt;Becker, Sascha O. and Wossmann, Ludger. "Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economics History." Munich Discussion Paper No. 2007-7, 22 January 2007. http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1366/1/weberLMU.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] at the Russian Academy of Sciences,&lt;ref name="urss.ru"/&gt; showed that literacy levels differing in religious areas can sufficiently explain the economic gaps cited by Weber. The results were supported even under a concentric diffusion model of Protestantism using distance from Wittenberg as a model.&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"/&gt;

==Support==

In 1958, American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] conducted an empirical inquiry into "religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life" in the [[Detroit]], Mich., area. It revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported basic hypotheses of Weber's work ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. According to Lenski, "the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church, had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics. and Family Life'', Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt;

German theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf notes: "Sociologists of religion like [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] have interpreted the Protestant revolution in [[Latin America]] as implicit support of basic elements of Weber's thesis. [...] At any rate, many pious persons there interpret their transition from the Roman Catholic church to Protestant [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations in terms of a moral idea that promises long-term economic gains through strong innerworldly asceticism. The strict ascetic self-discipline that has been successfully institutionalized in the Pentecostal congregations, the readiness to work more and with greater effort and to take less leisurely attitudes lead many Pentecostal Christians to believe that their new faith in God is supported by their economic successes."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Graf (2010), ''Der Protestantismus. Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Second, Revised Edition, Munich (Germany), pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Two Babylons (7th Edition).jpg|thumb|Cover of the 7th edition of ''The Two Babylons'' (1871), which claims that [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrines and ceremonies are a veiled continuation of [[Babylonia]]n paganism.]]
'''''The Two Babylons''''', subtitled '''''The Papal Worship Proved to Be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife''''' is a religious [[pamphlet]] published in 1853 by the [[Presbyterian]] [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] [[theology|theologian]] [[Alexander Hislop]] (1807–65).

Its central theme is its allegation that the [[Catholic Church]] is a veiled continuation of the [[pagan]] religion of ancient [[Babylon]], the product of a millennia-old secret [[New World Order (conspiracy)|conspiracy]] founded by the Biblical king [[Nimrod]] and the Assyrian queen [[Semiramis]], who Hislop claimed was Nimrod's wife.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grabbe|first=Lester L.|authorlink=Lester L.

==Publication history==
It was expanded in 1858, going through many editions. A 3rd edition was published in 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Babylons Third Edition|url=https://archive.org/stream/twobabylonsorpa00hislgoog#page/n6/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 7th in 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Babylons Seventh Edition|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029406448#page/n1/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popular edition in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Babylons Popular Edition|url=https://archive.org/stream/thetwobabylonsor00hisluoft#page/n1/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed on many websites that ''The Two Babylons'' was only finally published as a book in 1919, even though the third edition had already reached 500 pages in length.

The book has been published by various Protestant publishing houses over the years, one being [[Chick Tract|Chick Publications]], which is still publishing the book as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/catalog/books/0185.asp ''The Two Babylons''], Chick Publications, retrieved 2018-08-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Hislop builds on the [[Panbabylonism|Panbabylonian]] school of [[Hyperdiffusionism in archaeology|Hyperdiffusionism]], which was common in the 19th century, to argue that Classical and Ancient Near Eastern civilization took its inspiration from [[Babylon]]. From this, he derives the argument that the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]] of [[Late Antiquity]] were actually offshoots of one ancient religion founded at the [[Tower of Babel]]. Panbabylonism has since been relegated to pseudohistory by some 20th-century scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Peter Lancaster. ''Megaliths, Myths and Men: An Introduction to Astro-Archaeology'' p. 268. Dover Publications, New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Hislop's work centers on his association of the legendary [[Ninus]] and his semi-historical wife [[Semiramis]] with the Biblical [[Nimrod]] as her husband and her son, with their incestuous male offering being [[Tammuz]]. [[Hellenistic]] histories of the Ancient Near East tended to conflate their faint recollections of the deeds of ancient kings into legendary figures who exerted far more power than any ancient king ever did. In Assyria, they invented an [[eponymous]] founder of [[Nineveh]] named Ninus, who supposedly ruled 52 years over an empire comparable to the Persian Empire at its greatest extent. Ninus's wife Semiramis was in turn a corruption of the historical figure [[Shammuramat]], regent of the [[Neo-Assyrian]] Empire from 811 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Hislop takes Ninus as a historical figure, and associates him with the Biblical figure [[Nimrod]], though he was not the first to do so. The [[Clementine literature]] made the association in the 4th Century AD. An influential belief throughout the Middle Ages was that Ninus was the inventor of Idolatry,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Camille]], The Gothic Idol: Ideology and Image-Making in Medieval Art, Cambridge,1991: 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that Hislop clearly drew upon. However, Hislop wrote before the historical records of the ancient near east had been thoroughly decoded and studied, that cast doubt in the decades after he wrote whether there was any such figure as Ninus, and the Greek authors whom he quoted lacked credibility on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Sarah Raup|title=Historical Fictions and Hellenistic Jewish Identity: Third Maccabbees in its Cultural Context|date=2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0-520-23307-7|pages=112-113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfiJ6foYhMAC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=Was+Ninus+a+historical+figure?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pdm5BXVl-r&amp;sig=6xaLfpuiBMd5f6KJHTwnR1PpiLo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLl-OfoZ7UAhVK7oMKHXj5DMIQ6AEIYDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=Was%20Ninus%20a%20historical%20figure%3F&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ishtar Eshnunna Louvre AO12456.jpg|thumb|Relief of the Babylonian goddess [[Ishtar]], whose name Hislop  claimed to be the root behind the English word ''Easter'']]

''The Two Babylons'' heavily relies on [[Austen Henry Layard]]'s publications of his excavations at Nineveh, which had only been just discovered in 1851. This gave his work an appearance of being well-researched at the time of its publication. For example, Hislop linked the name of [[Easter]] with [[Astarte]], the [[Phoenicia]]n fertility goddess by citing Layard's recent discovery of Astarte's Assyrian name, ''[[Ishtar]]'', which Hislop took to be "identical" to Easter.
{{Quote|text=What means the term Easter itself? It is not a Christian name. It bears its [[Babylon|Chaldean]] origin on its very forehead. Easter is nothing else than Astarte, one of the titles of [[Beltis]], the queen of heaven, whose name, as pronounced by the people Nineveh, was evidently identical with that now in common use in this country. That name, as found by Layard on the Assyrian monuments, is Ishtar. |author=Hislop |source=The Two Babylons, Chapter 3, Section 2, Easter}}

The claim that ''Easter'' is derived from ''Ishtar'' has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Costa|first1=Krystal|title=Beyond Ishtar: The Tradition of Eggs at Easter: Don't believe every meme you encounter.|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/beyond-ishtar-the-tradition-of-eggs-at-easter/|website=Scientific American|publisher=Nature America, Inc.|accessdate=8 July 2017}}{{RS|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern etymologists derive the word ''Easter'' from the Proto-Indo-European root ''*aus-'', meaning "dawn,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Calvert Watkins|Watkins, Calvert]] (2006 [2000]). ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots''. p. 2021. [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]. {{ISBN|0-618-08250-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially by way of [[Hausos|{{PIE|*h₂ewsṓs}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallory|first=J. P.|author-link=J. P.

Adams|year=1997|title=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=1-884964-98-2|ref=harv}} p. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ishtar'' is a Semitic name of uncertain etymology, possibly taken from the same root as Assyria, or from a semitic word meaning "to irrigate."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, George A. ''On the Etymology of Ishtar.'' Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 31, No. 4 (1911), pp. 355-358&lt;/ref&gt;

Hislop ultimately claimed to trace Catholic doctrines back to the [[worship]] of [[Nimrod]], asserting that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] represented [[Whore of Babylon]] of the [[Book of Revelation]] and that "the [[Pope]] himself is truly and properly the lineal representative of [[Belshazzar]]". He claimed that the [[Christogram]] IHS, the first three Greek letters in the name of Jesus, represented Latin characters standing for [[Isis]], [[Horus]] and [[Geb|Seb]].

==Analysis==

In the note by the editor of the 7th edition, which was published in 1871, it was claimed, "that no one, so far as we are aware, has ventured to challenge the accuracy of the historical proofs adduced in support of the startling announcement on the title page." Since then however there have been many who have challenged the accuracy of Hislop's claims. For example, [[Lester L. Grabbe]] has highlighted the fact that Hislop's entire argument, particularly his association of [[Ninus]] with [[Nimrod]], is based on a misunderstanding of historical Babylon and its religion.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; Grabbe also criticizes Hislop for portraying the mythological queen [[Semiramis]] as Nimrod's consort,&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; despite the fact that she is never even mentioned in a single text associated with him,&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; and for portraying her as the "mother of harlots",&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; even though this is not how she is depicted in any of the texts where she is mentioned.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt;

In 2011, a critical edition was published.&lt;ref&gt;which also contains the English book by Ralph Woodrow ''Von Babylon nach Rom? – The Two Babylons?'', 2011; {{ISBN|978-3-9811529-5-1}}, as well as the papers by Ralph Woodrow and Dr. Eddy Lanz&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hislop's work is extensively footnoted, some commentators (in particular [[Ralph Woodrow]]) have stated that the document contains numerous misconceptions, fabrications, logical fallacies, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, and grave factual errors.&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow, Ralph [http://equip.org/article/the-two-babylons/ BOOK REVIEW - The Two Babylons: A Case Study in Poor Methodology] Christian Research Institute, Vol. 22, No. 2, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Some [[Christian Fundamentalism|fundamentalist Protestants]] still regard Hislop's book as proof that the Roman Catholic Church is, in fact, the continuation of ancient Babylonian religion.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mcllhenny"/&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] periodical ''[[The Watchtower]]'' frequently published excerpts from it until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="veith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2013/02/lent-and-ash-wednesday-are-not-pagan-relics/|title=Lent and Ash Wednesday are NOT pagan relics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book's thesis has also featured prominently in the [[conspiracy theories]] of [[racist]] groups such as [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barkun [https://books.google.com/books?id=bdGSbDaCQVsC&amp;dq Religion and the Racist Right], pp. 192-193, UNC Press 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and other fringe groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barkun [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq A Culture of Conspiracy], p. 210, Univ. of California Press 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Author and [[conspiracy theorist]] [[David Icke]] incorporates Hislop's claims about Semiramis into his book ''The Biggest Secret'', claiming that Semiramis played a key role in the establishment of a global conspiracy run by [[Reptilian humanoid|Reptilian]] aliens, whom he asserts is secretly controlling humanity.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''The Biggest Secret, 52-54''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|concepts}}

The '''Third Period''' is an [[ideology|ideological concept]] adopted by the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) at its Sixth World Congress, held in [[Moscow]] in the summer of 1928.

The Comintern's theory was based on its economic and political analysis of world [[capitalism]], which posited the division of recent history into three periods. These included a "First Period" that followed [[World War I]] and saw the revolutionary upsurge and defeat of the working class, as well as a "Second Period" of capitalist consolidation for most of the decade of the 1920s. According to the Comintern's analysis, the current phase of world economy from 1928 onward, the so-called "Third Period," was to be a time of widespread economic collapse and mass [[working class]] radicalization. This economic and political discord would again make the time ripe for proletarian [[revolution]] if militant policies were rigidly maintained by [[communist]] [[Vanguard Party|vanguard parties]], the Comintern believed.

Communist policies during the Third Period were marked by extreme hostility to [[reformism|political reformism]] and political organizations espousing it as an impediment to the movement's revolutionary objectives. In the field of [[trade unions]], a move was made during the Third Period towards the establishment of radical [[dual unions]] under [[communist party]] control rather than continuation of the previous policy of attempting to radicalize existing unions by "boring from within."

The rise of the [[Nazi Party]] to power in [[Germany]] in 1933 and the annihilation of the organized communist movement there shocked the Comintern into reassessing the tactics of the Third Period. From 1934, new alliances began to be formed under the aegis of the so-called "[[Popular Front]]." The Popular Front policy was formalized as the official policy of the world communist movement by the [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern]] in 1935.

==Development and causes of the Third Period==

In December 1927, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party]] held its Fifteenth [[Party Congress]]; prior to this Congress, the faction of the Party led by Stalin had supported the continuation of the New Economic Policy (NEP). However, in the cities, industry had become undercapitalized, and prices were rising. In the countryside, moreover, the NEP had resulted in an enrichment of certain privileged sections of the [[Russia]]n and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[peasant]]ry (the [[Kulaks]]) because of [[deregulation]] of prices for grain. An embryonic new [[bourgeoisie]] was meanwhile growing up on the basis of the [[Market (economics)|market]] relations introduced under the NEP and gaining increasing influence both within the Party and in the state apparatus.

These events were leading to growing economic and political instability. The towns were being threatened with a "chronic danger of famine" in 1928-1929.&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher, Isaac, ''Stalin'', pp322, Penguin, (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Left Opposition]] had opposed the continued marketization of agriculture through the NEP policy, and, since 1924, had repeatedly called for investment in industry, some [[collectivization]] in agriculture and democratisation of the Party. Threatened by the growing power and revolt from the countryside led by the Kulaks and the strengthening bourgeoisie, the Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party passed resolutions that supported for some of the planks of the Opposition’s platform, and on paper, the Congress’ views appeared very left, politically.&lt;ref&gt;Stalin's proposals were set out in [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1928/07_13.htm "Questions of Socialist Construction in the U.S.S.R"], 1928. [[Leon Trotsky]]'s version is set out in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/ch02.htm#ch02-2 "A Sharp Turn: “The Five Year Plan in Four Years” and “Complete Collectivization”"] in ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/index.htm The Revolution Betrayed]'' 1936&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Left Opposition was expelled.

The new policies of industrialisation and [[Collectivisation in the USSR|collectivisation]] now adopted were given the slogan "[[socialist accumulation]]". The Communist party had publicly proposed collectivisation to be voluntary; however, lower level officials occasionally disregarded official policy, and motivated the peasants into joining the communes by use of threats and false promises. In what Issac Deutscher calls "the great change",&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher, Isaac, ''Stalin'', pp296ff, Penguin, (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; the new policies of industrialisation and collectivisation now adopted were carried out in a ruthless and brutal way, via the use of the security and military forces, without the direct involvement of the working class and peasantry itself and without seeming regard for the social consequences. According to figures given by Deutscher, the peasants opposed forced collectivisation by slaughtering 18 million horses, 30 million cattle, about 45 per cent of the total, and 100 million sheep and goats, about two thirds of the total. Kulaks who engaged in these behaviours were dealt with harshly; in December 1929, Stalin issued a call to "liquidate the ''kulaks'' as a class" - emphasis on ''as a class'' is needed, because it was not a call to eliminate the individuals themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher, Isaac, ''Stalin'', p324, Penguin, (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; Policies included their deportation to remote lands in [[Siberia]] and to [[Gulag|correctional labour camps]]. There is debate amongst historians as to whether the actions of the Kulaks and their supporters helped lead to famine, or whether the policy of collectivisation itself was responsible. (See [[Collectivisation in the USSR]], [[Holodomor]].)

In the West, the [[crisis of capitalism]] was coming to a head with the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, and the [[Communist International]]'s Sixth Congress viewed capitalism as entering a final death agony, its "third period of existence" where the first had been capitalism during its rise prior to [[World War I]], and the second was the short period after the crushing of the post-World War I [[revolution]]s when capitalism seemed again to have stabilised.

The formal institution of the Third Period occurred at the 9th Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (E.C.C.I.) in February 1928. This helped in dovetailing the "Left" of the All-Union Communist party with that of the Comintern itself.

To the Comintern, a decisive and final [[revolution]]ary upheaval was afoot and all its sections had to prepare for the immediate advent of [[world revolution]]. As part of this theory, because the Comintern felt that conditions were strong enough, it demanded that its political positions within the workers’ movement be consolidated and that all "[[reactionary]]" elements be purged. Accordingly, attacks and expulsions were launched against [[social democrats]] and moderate [[socialists]] within [[labour union]]s where the local CP had majority support, as well as [[Trotskyists]] and [[united front]] proponents. The All-Union Communist Party also encouraged armed rebellion in [[China]], [[Spartacist League|Germany]], and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

Although shortcomings and crippling ideological vacillations brought this Period to an end, the tone of the "Third Period" resonated powerfully with the mood of many militant workers of the time, especially following the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] and the ensuing crises of the 1930s. In many countries, [[Communist Party USA|including the United States]], local Communist Parties' membership and influence grew as a result of the "Third Period" policies.&lt;ref&gt;This section is adopted in part from a public domain article by David Walters for the [http://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/t/h.htm#third-period Marxists Internet Archive]'s Encyclopedia of Marxism.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Social fascism"==

One notable development in this period was that Communists organized the unemployed into a political force, despite their distance from the [[means of production]]. Another distinguishing feature of this policy was that Communists fought against their rivals on the left as vehemently as their opponents on the right of the political spectrum, with special viciousness directed at real or imaginary followers of [[Leon Trotsky]]. [[Social Democracy|Social Democrats]] were targeted by Communist polemics, in which they were dubbed "[[Social fascism|social fascists]]."

Trotskyists have blamed Stalin's line for the rise of [[Nazism]] because it precluded unity between the German communists with the German [[Social Democrats]]. Hitler's rise to power, consequently, was also a reason for the abandonment of the policy in favor of the Popular Front strategy because Germany became the biggest security threat to the Soviet Union.

==North America==

Historians of the left have debated the contribution made by Communist activism in [[North America]] during the Third Period. Some  authors like [[Robin D. G. Kelley]] and John Manley have penned local histories that portray Communist Party members as effective activists, heroic in many cases because their revolutionary zeal helped them confront extremely adverse circumstances. Despite the shadow of [[Stalinism]], in this perspective, the important positive contributions Communist organizers made in working class history should not be discounted.

Critics of this perspective argue that these histories gloss over or ignore both the horrors of Stalinism and also the devastating consequences of the Third Period inasmuch as it facilitated the rise of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and alienated the working class writ large from the left because of its sectarianism and adventurism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roediger|first=David|title=Where Communism was Black|journal=American Quarterly |volume=44|issue=1 |pages=123–128|date=March 1992|doi=10.2307/2713184|last2=Kelley|first2=Robin D.

The following timeline covers European exploration from 1418 to 1957.

The 15th century witnessed the rounding of the feared [[Cape Bojador]] and Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa, while in the last decade of the century the Spanish sent expeditions to the New World, focusing on exploring the [[Caribbean Sea]], and the Portuguese discovered the sea route to India. In the 16th century, various countries sent exploring parties into the interior of the Americas, as well as to their respective west and east coasts north to California and Labrador and south to Chile and Tierra del Fuego. In the 17th century, the Russians explored and conquered Siberia in search of sables, while the Dutch roughly worked on the chart for Australia. The 18th century saw the first extensive exploration of the South Pacific and the discovery of Alaska, while the nineteenth was dominated by exploration of the polar regions (not to mention excursions into the heart of Africa). By the 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:

'''White gods''' is the belief that [[ancient]] [[cultures]] around the world were visited by [[Caucasian race]]s in ancient times, and that they were known as "White gods".

Based on 16th-century accounts of the Spanish [[conquistadors]] being "greeted as gods" by the peoples of the [[New World]], certain modern authors have expanded the concept beyond what is historically verifiable, spreading it to the genre of [[pseudoarchaeological]] literature and [[fringe theory|fringe theorists]], such as writers on [[ancient astronaut]]s or [[Atlantis]], in some instances (such as [[Christian Identity]]) even acquiring quasi-religious or racialist ([[white supremacist]]) connotations.

[[File:Quetzalcoatl magliabechiano.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the [[Codex Magliabechiano]].]]
Some [[authors]] have claimed that white missionaries or "gods" visited [[Americas|America]] before [[Christopher Columbus]]. Authors usually quote from [[mythology]] and [[legend]]s which discuss ancient gods such as [[Quetzalcoatl]] to conclude that the legends were actually based on [[White people|Caucasians]] visiting those areas, and that the Caucasians were really the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0osWcOoQGf4C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=white+gods&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gpb3TYikLtCt8QOVnvjKCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20gods&amp;f=false |title=Myths of Pre-Columbian America – Donald A.

[[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[chroniclers]] from the 16th century claimed that when the [[conquistadors]] led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] first encountered the Incas they were greeted as gods, "Viracochas", because their lighter skin resembled their god named [[Viracocha]].&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Spanish America: a documentary history'', Kenneth R. Mills, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This story was first reported by [[Pedro Cieza de León]] (1553) and later by [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]]. Similar accounts by Spanish chroniclers (e.g. [[Juan de Betanzos]]) describe Viracocha as a "White God", often with a beard.&lt;ref&gt;''Pre-Columbian America: Myths and Legends'', Donald. A. Mackenzie, Senate, 1996, p.268-270&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel A. Braghine in his 1940 book ''The Shadow of Atlantis'' claimed that the [[Kalina people|Carib people]] have reports and legends of a white bearded man whom they called ''Tamu'' or ''Zune'' who had come from the East, taught the people [[agriculture]] and later disappeared in an "easterly direction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aqoUiUp3u8C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=colonel+braghine+zukha&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k8L3Ta_vDcKy8QOwuomrCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Shadow of Atlantis 1940 – A.

The [[archaeologist]] Pierre Honoré in 1962 proposed the [[fringe theory]] that the pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations were due to "white men from the vicinity of Crete".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Honoré, ''In quest of the white god: the mysterious heritage of South American civilization'',  Futura Publications (1962). In  2007, the book was reprinted as ''In Search of Quetzalcoatl: The Mysterious Heritage of American Civilization''.

The writer [[Robert F. Marx]] has written extensively about the concept of "White gods". Marx came to the conclusion that white gods "figure in almost every indigenous culture in the Americas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Kirsch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-22/news/vw-383_1_great-white-god |title=BOOK REVIEW : Memoir Masquerades as History in 'Quest of Great White Gods' : IN QUEST OF THE GREAT WHITE GODS, Contact Between the Old and New World From the Dawn of History by Robert F.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Harold T.

The [[occultist]] [[James H. Madole]], influenced by [[Aryanism]] and [[Hinduism]], wrote that the [[Aryan race]] was of great antiquity and had been worshipped worldwide by lower races as "white gods". Madole also wrote that the Aryans originated in the [[Garden of Eden]] located in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, 2003 p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern scholars consider the "White God legends" to be a post-conquest Spanish invention and that the ideas are based on [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: encyclopedia of Pseudoscience'', "white god legends", Michael Shermer, ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mormonism==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
{{see also|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Proposed Book of Mormon geographical setting|Mormon folklore}}

Some [[Mormon]]s believe that [[Quetzalcoatl]], a figure described as white and bearded, who came from the sky and promised to return, was likely [[Jesus Christ]]. According to the scriptural account recorded in the [[Book of Mormon]], Jesus Christ visited and taught natives of the Americas following his resurrection, and regarded them as the "other sheep" whom he had referenced during his mortal ministry. The Book of Mormon also claims that Jesus Christ appeared to others, following his resurrection, even to the inhabitants on the "isles of the sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=11&amp;num=1&amp;id=298 |author= Wirth, Diane E. |date= 2002 |title= Quetzalcoatl, the Maya maize god and Jesus Christ |journal= Journal of Book of Mormon Studies |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 4–15 |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Maxwell Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the Mexican legend, [[LDS Church]] [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of the life of the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely resembles that of the Savior; so closely, indeed, that we can come to no other conclusion than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Taylor, John |author-link= John Taylor (Mormon) |date= 1892 |origyear= 1882 |title= An Examination into and an Elucidation of the Great Principle of the Mediation and Atonement of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ |publisher= [[Deseret News]] |page= 201 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QmQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This idea was adapted by Mormon science fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]] in his story ''[[America (short story)|America]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Ancient astronauts==
Some [[Ancient astronaut]] and [[UFO]] writers have claimed the "white gods" were actually [[extraterrestrials]]. [[Peter Kolosimo]] believed that the legends of [[Quetzalcoatl]] had a basis in fact.  He claimed that the legends actually describe a race of white men who were born in spaceships and migrated to [[Atlantis]]; then, after Atlantis was destroyed, they moved to the [[Americas]] to be treated as "white gods" by the "primitive earth-dwellers".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolosimo, Timeless Earth, 1977 pp. 153 – 154 {{ISBN|0-7221-5329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World history''' or '''global history''' (not to be confused with [[diplomatic history|diplomatic]], [[transnational history|transnational]] or international history) is a field of [[historiography|historical study]] that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines [[history]] from a global perspective. It is not to be confused with [[comparative history]], which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale.  World history looks for common [[pattern]]s that emerge across all cultures. World historians use a [[theme (literature)|thematic]] approach, with two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]] (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how [[pattern]]s of world history reveal the diversity of the human experiences).&lt;ref&gt;J. Laurence Hare, and Jack Wells, "Promising the World: Surveys, Curricula, and the Challenge of Global History," ''History Teacher,'' 48 (Feb. 2015) pp: 371-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and parameters of the field==

Jerry H. Bentley has observed that 'the term ''world history'' has never been a clear signifier with a stable referent', and that usage of the term overlaps with [[universal history]], [[comparative history]], [[global history]], [[big history]], [[macro history]], and [[transnational history]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of world history as a distinct academic field of study can be traced to the 1960s, but the pace quickened in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gran2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Gran|title=The Rise of the Rich: A New View of Modern World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOv-dewXZi4C|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=28 February 2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3171-2|page=XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key step was the creation of the World History Association and graduate programs at a handful of universities. Over the next decades scholarly publications, professional and academic organizations, and graduate programs in World History proliferated. World History has often displaced Western Civilization in the required curriculum of American high schools and universities, and is supported by new textbooks with a world history approach.

World History attempts to recognise and address two structures that have profoundly shaped professional history-writing:
# A tendency to use current [[nation-states]] to the set the boundaries and agendas of studies of the past.
# A deep legacy of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] assumptions (found especially, but not only, in Western history-writing).
Thus World History tends to study networks, connections, and systems that cross traditional boundaries of historical study like linguistic, cultural, and national borders. World History is often concerned to explore social dynamics that have led to large-scale changes in human society, such as [[industrialisation]] and the spread of [[capitalism]], and to analyse how large-scale changes like these have affected different parts of the world. Like other branches of history-writing in the second half of the twentieth century, World History has a scope far beyond historians' traditional focus on politics, wars, and diplomacy, taking in a panoply of subjects like [[gender history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], and [[environmental history]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H.

==History==

===Pre-modern===
The study of world history, as distinct from national history, has existed in many world cultures. However, early forms of world history were not truly global, and were limited to only the regions known by the historian.

In [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], Chinese world history, that of China and the surrounding people of [[East Asia]], was based on the [[dynastic cycle]] articulated by [[Sima Qian]] in circa 100 BC. Sima Qian's model is based on the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. Rulers rise when they united China, then are overthrown when a ruling dynasty became corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, ''Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty'' (3rd ed. 1995) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231081693 excerpt and text search]; Burton Watson, ''Ssu-ma Ch'ien: Grand Historian of China'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Each new dynasty begins virtuous and strong, but then decays, provoking the transfer of Heaven's mandate to a new ruler. The test of virtue in a new dynasty is success in being obeyed by China and neighboring barbarians. After 2000 years Sima Qian's model still dominates scholarship, although the [[dynastic cycle]] is no longer used for modern Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;S. Y. Teng, "Chinese Historiography in the Last Fifty Years," ''The Far Eastern Quarterly,'' Vol. 8, No. 2 (Feb., 1949), pp. 131–156 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2049138 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), as founder of Greek historiography,&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Waters, ''Herodotus the Historian'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; presents insightful and lively discussions of the customs, geography, and history of Mediterranean peoples, particularly the Egyptians. However, his great rival [[Thucydides]] promptly discarded Herodotus's all-embracing approach to history, offering instead a more precise, sharply focused monograph, dealing not with vast empires over the centuries but with 27 years of war between Athens and Sparta. In Rome, the vast, patriotic history of Rome by Livy (59 BC-17 AD) approximated Herodotean inclusiveness;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick G. Walsh, ''Livy: His Historical Aims and Methods'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Polybius (c.200-c.118 BC) aspired to combine the logical rigor of Thucydides with the scope of Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Walbank, ''A Historical Commentary on Polybius,'' (3 vols. 1957–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia, [[The Secret History of Mongols]] is regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. The Secret History is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world.

In the Middle East, [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]] (1226–1283) was a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā (History of the World Conqueror).&lt;ref&gt;History of the World Conqueror by Ala Ad Din Ata Malik Juvaini, translated by John Andrew Boyle, Harvard University Press 1958, Project Gutenberg on line edition&lt;/ref&gt; The standard edition of Juvayni is published under the title Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle "The History of the World-Conqueror" was republished in 1997.

[[Rashīd al-Dīn Fadhl-allāh Hamadānī]] (1247–1318), was a Persian physician of Jewish origin, polymathic writer and historian, who wrote an enormous Islamic history, the Jami al-Tawarikh, in the Persian language, often considered a landmark in intercultural historiography and a key document on the Ilkhanids (13th and 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, H. M. (Henry Miers), Sir; John Dowson. "10. Jámi'u-t Tawáríkh, of Rashid-al-Din". [[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]. The Muhammadan Period (Vol 3.). London : Trübner &amp; Co.. https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073036737#page/n15/mode/2up.&lt;/ref&gt; His encyclopedic knowledge of a wide range of cultures from Mongolia to China to the Steppes of Central Eurasia to Persia, the Arabic-speaking lands, and Europe, provide the most direct access to information on the late Mongol era. His descriptions also highlight the manner in which the Mongol Empire and its emphasis on trade resulted in an atmosphere of cultural and religious exchange and intellectual ferment, resulting in the transmission of a host of ideas from East to West and vice versa.

One Muslim scholar, [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1409) broke with traditionalism and offered a model of historical change in ''Muqaddimah,'' an exposition of the methodology of scientific history. Ibn Khaldun focused on the reasons for the rise and fall of civilization, arguing that the causes of change are to be sought in the economic and social structure of society. His work was largely ignored in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'' ed. by N. J. Dawood, Bruce Lawrence, and Franz Rosenthal (2004) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691120544 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the Muslim, Chinese and Indian intellectuals held fast to a religious traditionalism, leaving them unprepared to advise national leaders on how to confront the European intrusion into Asia after 1500 AD.

===Early modern===
During the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').Voltaire, in the 18th century, attempted to revolutionize the study of world history. First, Voltaire concluded that the traditional study of history was flawed. The Christian Church, one of the most powerful entities in his time, had presented a framework for studying history. Voltaire, when writing ''History of Charles XII'' (1731) and ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), instead choose to focus economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/voltaire-9520178|title=Voltaire|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of history were mostly unexplored by his contemporaries and would each develop into their own sections of world history. Above all else, Voltaire regarded truth as the most essential part of recording world history. Nationalism and religion only subtracted from objective truth, so Voltaire freed himself for their influence when he recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shank|first=J.B.|title=Voltaire|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/voltaire/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) in Italy wrote ''Scienza nuva seconda'' (The New Science) in 1725, which argued history as the expression of human will and deeds.  He thought that men are historical entities and that human nature changes over time. Each epoch should be seen as a whole in which all aspects of culture—art, religion, philosophy, politics, and economics—are interrelated (a point developed later by [[Oswald Spengler]]). Vico showed that myth, poetry, and art are entry points to discovering the true spirit of a culture. Vico outlined a conception of historical development in which great cultures, like Rome, undergo cycles of growth and decline.  His ideas were out of fashion during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but influenced the Romantic historians after 1800.

A major theoretical foundation for world history was given by German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], who saw the modern Prussian state as the latest (though often confused with the highest) stage of world development.

G.W.F. Hegel developed three lenses through which he believed world history could be viewed. Documents produced during a historical period, such as journal entries and contractual agreements, were considered by Hegel to be part of Original History. These documents are produced by a person enveloped within a culture, making them conduits of vital information but also limited in their contextual knowledge. Documents which pertain to Hegel’s Original History are classified by modern historians as primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Little|first=Daniel|title=Philosophy of History|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/history/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflective History, Hegel’s second lens, are documents written with some temporal distance separating the event which is discussed in the academic writing. What limited this lens, according to Hegel, was the imposition of the writers own cultural values and views on the historical event. This criticism of Reflective History was later formalized by Anthropologists Franz Boa and coined as Cultural relativism by Alain Locke. Both of these lenses were considered to be partially flawed by Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul and the Body in Hegel's Anthropology|last=Nicholas|first=Mowad|publisher=Loyola University Chicago|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel termed the lens which he advocated to view world history through as Philosophical History.  In order to view history through this lens, one must analyze events, civilizations, and periods objectively. When done in this fashion, the historian can then extract the prevailing theme from their studies. This lens differs from the rest because it is void of any cultural biases and takes a more analytical approach to history. World History can be a broad topic, so focusing on extracting the most valuable information from certain periods may be the most beneficial approach. This third lens, as did Hegel’s definitions of the other two, affected the study of history in the early modern period and our contemporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=David|title=Hegel and the Idea of Philosophical History|jstor=27744789|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369–388|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early modern historian was Adam Ferguson. Ferguson’s main contribution to the study of world history was his ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Adam. ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society. (1767).''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ferguson, world history was a combination of two forms of history. One was natural history; the aspects of our world which god created. The other, which was more revolutionary, was social history. For him, social history was the progress humans made towards fulfilling God’s plan for humanity. He believed that progress, which could be achieved through individuals pursuing commercial success, would bring us closer to a perfect society; but we would never reach one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TEE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ADAM FERGUSON A COMMENTARY CN HIS ESSAY CK THE HISTORY OF CIVIL SOCIETY|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1969|isbn=|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also theorized that a complete dedication to commercial success could lead to societal collapse—like what happened in Rome—because people would lose morality. Through this lens, Ferguson viewed world history as humanities struggle to reach an ideal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/Ferguson/Adam%20Ferguson.htm|title=Adam Ferguson|website=www.d.umn.edu|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Home, Lord Kames was a philosopher during the Enlightenment and contributed to the study or world history. In his major historical work, ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home’s outlined the four stages of human history which he observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kames.htm|title=Henry Home, Lord Kames|website=www.hetwebsite.net|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most primitive stage was small hunter-gatherer groups. Then, in order to form larger groups, humans transitioned into the second stage when they began to domesticate animals. The third stage was the development of agriculture. This new technology established trade and higher levels of cooperation amongst sizable groups of people. With the gathering of people into agricultural villages, laws and social obligations needed to be developed so a form of order could be maintained. The fourth, and final stage, involved humans moving into market towns and seaports where agriculture was not the focus. Instead, commerce and other forms of labor arouse in a society. By defining the stages of human history, Homes influenced his successors. He also contributed to the development of other studies such as sociology and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/kames-on-progress-and-providence|title=Kames on Progress and Providence  - Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
World history became a popular genre in the 20th century with [[universal history]]. In the 1920s, several best-sellers dealt with the history of the world, including surveys ''[[The Story of Mankind]]'' (1921) by [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]] and ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1918) by [[H.G. Wells]]. Influential writers who have reached wide audiences include [[H. G. Wells]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Carroll Quigley]], [[Christopher Dawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley J. Birzer, ''Sanctifying the World: The Augustinian Life and Mind of Christopher Dawson'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Scholars working the field include [[Eric Voegelin]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Federici, ''Eric Voegelin: The Restoration of Order'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill]] and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The Sources of Social Power: Volume 1, A History of Power from the Beginning to AD 1760'' (1986) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/052131349X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; With evolving technologies such as dating methods and surveying laser technology called LiDAR, contemporary historians have access to knew information which changes how past civilizations are studied.

[[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ''Decline of the West'' (2 vol 1919–1922) compared nine organic cultures: Egyptian (3400 BC-1200 BC), Indian (1500 BC-1100 BC), Chinese (1300 BC-AD 200), Classical (1100 BC-400 BC), Byzantine (AD 300–1100), Aztec (AD 1300–1500), Arabian (AD 300–1250), Mayan (AD 600–960), and Western (AD 900–1900). His book was a smashing success among intellectuals worldwide as it predicted the disintegration of European and American civilization after a violent "age of Caesarism," arguing by detailed analogies with other civilizations. It deepened the post-World War I pessimism in Europe, and was warmly received by intellectuals in China, India, and Latin America who hoped his predictions of the collapse of European empires would soon come true.&lt;ref&gt;Neil McInnes, "The Great Doomsayer: Oswald Spengler Reconsidered." ''National Interest'' 1997 (48): 65–76. Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936–1954, [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] ten-volume ''A Study of History'' came out in three separate installments. He followed Spengler in taking a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations. Toynbee said they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay. Toynbee rejected Spengler's biological model of civilizations as organisms with a typical life span of 1,000 years. Like [[Sima Qian]], Toynbee explained decline as due to their moral failure. Many readers rejoiced in his implication (in vols. 1–6) that only a return to some form of Catholicism could halt the breakdown of western civilization which began with the Reformation. Volumes 7–10, published in 1954, abandoned the religious message, and his popular audience slipped away, while scholars  picked apart his mistakes.,&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hardy McNeill|McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1963) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the Earth. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.''  Whatever it is called, the importance of these intercultural contacts has begun to be recognized by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, "The Changing Shape of World History." ''History and Theory'' 1995 34(2): 8–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History education==

===United States===
[[T. Walter Wallbank]] and [[Alastair M. Taylor]] co-authored ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'', the first world-history textbook published in the United States (1942). With additional authors, this very successful work went through numerous editions up to the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to the Golden Anniversary edition of 1992, the ongoing objective of ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'' "was to present a survey of world cultural history, treating the development and growth of civilization not as a unique European experience but as a global one through which all the great culture systems have interacted to produce the present-day world. It attempted to include all the elements of history – social, economic, political, religious, aesthetic, legal, and technological."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization Past &amp; Present|last=Wallbank|first=T. Walter, et al.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1992|isbn=978-0-673-38867-4|location=New York|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college curricula of the United States, world history became a popular replacement for courses on [[Western Civilization]]. Professors [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], previously of Northeastern University and now at the University of Pittsburgh's World History Center; and [[Ross E. Dunn]] at San Diego State are leaders in promoting innovative teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, ''Navigating World History: Historians Create a Global Past'' (2003); [[Ross E. Dunn]], ed., ''The New World History: A Teacher's Companion.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In schools of architecture in the U.S., the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] now requires that schools teach history that includes a non-west or global perspective. This reflects a decade-long effort to move past the standard Euro-centric approach that had dominated the field.&lt;ref&gt;See Points 8 and 9. http://www.naab.org/adaview.aspx?pageid=120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent themes==
In recent years, the relationship between African and world history has shifted rapidly from one of antipathy to one of engagement and synthesis. Reynolds (2007) surveys the relationship between African and world histories, with an emphasis on the tension between the area studies paradigm and the growing world-history emphasis on connections and exchange across regional boundaries. A closer examination of recent exchanges and debates over the merits of this exchange is also featured. Reynolds sees the relationship between African and world history as a measure of the changing nature of historical inquiry over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan T. Reynolds, "Africa and World History: from Antipathy to Synergy." ''History Compass'' 2007 5(6): 1998–2013. ISSN 1478-0542 Fulltext: [1. History Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history#The stages of history }}

The [[Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] claims the history of the world is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory divides the history of the world into the following periods:&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Taylor 1980 p. 330"&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705120509/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705030211/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Regna Darnell and Frederic Gleach argue that, in the Soviet Union, the Marxian theory of history was the only accepted orthodoxy, and stifled research into other schools of thought on history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Regna Darnell|author2=Frederic Gleach|title=Histories of Anthropology Annual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8jBlLIznIAC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=56|isbn=978-0803266636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, adherents of Marx's theories argue that [[Stalinism|Stalin distorted]] [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/how-stalin-distorted-marxism-2/]&lt;/ref&gt;
