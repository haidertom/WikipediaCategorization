{{Other uses|Acquired Taste (disambiguation)}}

An '''acquired taste''' is an appreciation for something unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it. In the case of food and drink, this may be due to a strong [[odor]] (such as certain types of [[cheese]], [[durian]], [[hákarl]], [[Kala Namak|black salt]], [[nattō]], [[asafoetida]], [[surströmming]], or [[stinky tofu]]), [[taste]] ([[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[Vegemite]] or [[Marmite]], bitter [[tea]]s, [[salty liquorice]], [[malt bread]], [[Types of chocolate#Classification|unsweetened chocolate]], [[sushi]], [[garnatálg]]), mouthfeel (such as [[sashimi]] and [[sushi]] featuring uncooked seafood), appearance, or association (such as [[Entomophagy|eating insects]] or organ meat).

== Acquiring the taste ==
===General acquisition of tastes===
The process of acquiring a taste can involve developmental maturation, genetics (of both taste sensitivity and personality), family example, and biochemical reward properties of foods.  Infants are born preferring sweet foods and rejecting sour and bitter tastes, and they develop a preference for salt at approximately 4 months.  [[Neophobia]] (fear of novelty) tends to vary with age in predictable, but not linear, ways.  Babies just beginning to eat solid foods generally accept a wide variety of foods, toddlers and young children are relatively neophobic towards food, and older children, adults, and the elderly are often adventurous eaters with wide-ranging tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=L. L.|title=Development of food preferences|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|date=1999|volume=19|issue=1|pages=41–62|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The general personality trait of novelty-seeking does not necessarily correlate highly with willingness to try new foods.  Level of food adventurousness may explain much of the variability of food preferences observed in "[[supertasters]]".  Supertasters are highly sensitive to bitter, spicy, and pungent flavours, and some avoid them and like to eat only mild, plain foods, but many supertasters who have high food adventurousness enjoy these intense flavors and seek them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ullrich|first1=N. V.|last2=Touger-Decker|first2=R.|last3=O’Sullivan-Maillet|first3=J.|last4=Tepper|first4=B. J.|title=PROP taster status and self-perceived food adventurousness influence food preferences|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=2004|volume=104|issue=4|pages=543–549|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2004.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some chemicals or combinations of chemicals in foods provide both flavor and beneficial or enjoyable effects on the body and mind and may be reinforcing, leading to an acquired taste.  A study that investigated the effect of adding caffeine and theobromine (active compounds in chocolate) vs. a placebo to identically-flavored drinks that participants tasted several times, yielded the development of a strong preference for the drink with the compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smit|first1=H. J.|last2=Blackburn|first2=R. J.|title=Reinforcing effects of caffeine and theobromine as found in chocolate|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=2005|volume=181|issue=1|pages=101–106|doi=10.1007/s00213-005-2209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentional acquisition of tastes===
Intentionally changing one's preferences can be hard to accomplish. It usually requires a deliberate effort, acting as if one likes something in order to have the responses and feelings that will produce the desired taste. The challenge becomes one of distinguishing authentic or legitimate acquired tastes as a result of deeply considered preference changes from inauthentic ones motivated by status or [[conformity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovens|first1=L.|title=Sour Grapes and Character Planning|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1992|volume=89|issue=2|pages=57–78|doi=10.2307/2027152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovens|first1=L.|title=The Intentional Acquisition of Mental States|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=1995|volume=55|issue=4|pages=821–840|doi=10.2307/2108334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aestheticism''' (also the '''Aesthetic Movement''') is an intellectual and [[art movement]] supporting the emphasis of [[aesthetic]] values more than social-political themes for [[literature]], [[fine art]], [[music]] and other [[art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference - 3rd Edition|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|pages=261|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denney, Colleen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvTZrnmy5RoC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Aesthetic+movement%22+swinburne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQGt-5H3y4&amp;sig=Ir3QCh29f7c926rkx620LbcB5fs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kjKSuy9BNDdlAebobGSAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Aesthetic%20movement%22%20swinburne&amp;f=false "At the Temple of Art: the Grosvenor Gallery, 1877-1890"], Issue 1165, p. 38, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8386-3850-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning&amp;nbsp;— "art for art's sake". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as [[Walter Pater]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as [[Harold Bloom]], who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] or [[Decadent movement|decadence]] represented in France, or [[decadentism]]o represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Aesthetic literature==
The British decadent writers were much influenced by the [[Oxford]] professor [[Walter Pater]] and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty.  His text ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the [[Decadent movement]] used the slogan "[[Art for Art's Sake]]" (''L'art pour l'art''), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher [[Victor Cousin]], although [[Angela Leighton]] in the publication ''On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word'' (2007) notes that the phrase was used by [[Benjamin Constant]] as early as 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Leighton (2007) 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted to have been promoted by [[Théophile Gautier]] in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and [[morality]].

[[Image:Design for an Aesthetic theatrical poster.png|thumb|left|300px|One of many ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons about æsthetes]]
The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept [[John Ruskin]],  [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[George MacDonald]]'s conception of art as something moral or useful, "Art for truth's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Raeper, William (1987) George MacDonald, p. 183. Tring, Herts., and Batavia, IL: Lion Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they believed that Art did not have any [[didactic]] purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and [[Synesthesia|synaesthetic]]/[[ideasthesia|Ideasthetic]] effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Predecessors of the Aesthetics included [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and some of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem ''L’Art'' by [[Théophile Gautier]], who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Aesthetic Movement in English Literature|last=McMullen|first=Lorraine|publisher=Bytown Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ but rather “a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.

In Britain the best representatives were [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], both influenced by the French Symbolists, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The style and these poets were satirised by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' and other works, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s drama ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'', and in comic magazines such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' particularly in works by George Du Maurier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YgrdCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=michele%20mendelssohn&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Aesthetic Culture|last=Mendelssohn|first=Michèle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0748623853|location=|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton Mackenzie]]'s novel ''[[Sinister Street]]'' makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of [[Evelyn Waugh]], who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are [[Robert Byron]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Harold Acton]], [[Nancy Mitford]], [[A.E. Housman]] and [[Anthony Powell]].

==Aesthetic visual arts==

Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley|Aubrey Beardsley]]. Although the work of [[Edward Burne-Jones]] was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and  conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition.

==Aesthetic Movement decorative arts==
[[File:Florian Papp Aesthetic Exhibition.jpg|thumb|Aesthetic Movement antiques at [[Florian Papp]], New York City]]
The primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim "art for art's sake", identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially [[fine art]], cannot apply in this context. Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Dresser]]. ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorative art is dissociated from fine art.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'' LXXXI, Saturday, August 12, 1882, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Morley. ''Reform and Eastern Art'' Decorative Arts Society Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.

Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. [[Christopher Dresser]], a student and later Professor at the school  worked with Owen Jones on ''The Grammar of Ornament'', as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862, and ''Principles of Design'' 1873.

Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:
* [[Ebonized]] wood with gilt highlights.
* Far Eastern influence.
* Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers.
* Blue and white on [[porcelain]] and other fine china.

Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.

Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that [[Oscar Wilde]] used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by ''Punch'' magazine and in ''Patience''.

In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled "The House Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;O'brien (1982) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the "Ornamental Aesthetic" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in [[Annandale National Historic Site]], located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular stylem but one such example is [[18 Stafford Terrace]], London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics.

An '''anachronism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνά}} {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}}, "against" and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|khronos}}, "time") is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period in time that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.

An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used for purposes of rhetoric, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, language, customs, attitudes, or fashions between different historical eras.

==Types== 
[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar's clothing of the book's time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle]]

=== Parachronism &lt;!-- 'Parachronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''parachronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παρά}}, "on the side", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).

This may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion.

Examples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm); or a teenager from that time period being an avid fan of [[ragtime]] music. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era—with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.

=== Prochronism &lt;!-- 'Prochronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''prochronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρό}}, "before", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] at the top of the article). A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.

===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===
The intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.

[[Image:Constantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|thumb|''Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns Become Brothers'': 19th-century flags in 16th-century scene]]
== Politically motivated anachronism ==
Some writings and works of art promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]—two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history—with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s. Here anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made.

== Art and literature ==
[[File:Lucas van Leyden - Lot and his Daughters - WGA12932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucas van Leyden]]'s 1520 painting ''Lot and His Daughters'' shows Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a typical Dutch city of the painter's time.]]
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Sir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: "It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as fashions move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. "Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; "Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker."&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anachronism can also be an aesthetic choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronisms abound in the works of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Raphael Santi: His Life and His Works|last=von Wolzogen|first=Alfred Freiherr|publisher=[[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]|year=1866|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZhAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare and the Uses of Antiquity: An Introductory Essay|last=Martindale |first=Michelle |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=9781134848508 |pages=121–125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDwrK5FNnN0C&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times. Anachronisms can exist in ancient texts. [[Carol Meyers]] says that these anachronisms can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/14/276782474/the-genesis-of-camels |title=Archaeology Find: Camels In 'Bible' Are Literary Anachronisms|last=Montagne|first=Renee |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2014-02-14|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture, such as Roman legionaries that wear leather armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-03-31/time-meddlers-anachronisms-in-print-and-on-film|title=Time meddlers: anachronisms in print and on film|last=Cole|first=Tom|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumb|[[Dinosaurs]] co-existing with [[hominid]]s, as here in ''[[The Flintstones]]'', is a relatively common anachronistic depiction in comics and animated cartoons.]]
=== Comical anachronism ===
[[Comedy]] fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect. Comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society, such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174969-hollywood-history-and-the-art-of-the-big-anachronism/|title=Hollywood, History, and the Art of the Big Anachronism|last=van Riper|first=A.

=== Future anachronism === &lt;!-- Section is linked from the redirected [Future anachronism] article; use caution. --&gt;
{{see also|Retrofuturism}}
[[File:Amazing_stories_193107.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In the future envisioned on this 1931 cover of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', [[Propeller (aeronautics) |propeller airplanes]] would coexist with [[space technology]] advanced enough for a large-scale [[colonization of Mars]].]]

Even with careful research, [[science fiction]] writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political and technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction|last1=Athans|first1=Philip|authorlink1=Philip Athans|last2=Salvatore|first2=R. A.|authorlink2=R. A. Salvatore|publisher=[[Adams Media]]|year=2010|isbn=9781440507298|pages=167–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9l5JO_FM6cC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, many books and films nominally set in the mid-21st century or later refer to the [[Soviet Union]], to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as [[Leningrad]], to [[Cold War|the continuing struggle between the Eastern and Western Blocs]] and to [[History of Germany (1945–90)|divided Germany and divided Berlin]]. ''[[Star Trek]]'' has suffered from future anachronisms; instead of "[[Retroactive continuity|retconning]]" these errors, the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 film]] retained them for consistency with older franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/living-the-star-trek-life/|title=Living the Star Trek life|last=Glaskowsky|first=Peter|work=[[CNET]]|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Buildings or natural features, such as the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], can become out of place once they disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/12/06/AR2005033116653.html|title='Empire': Gangster Tale Sleeps With the Fishes|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language anachronism ===
[[Language]] anachronisms in novels and films are quite common, both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/26/172955182/historical-vocab-when-we-get-it-wrong-does-it-matter|title=Historical Vocab: When We Get It Wrong, Does It Matter?|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past. In this regard, language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would find it difficult, or even impossible, to understand a film with dialogue in 15th-century English; thus, we [[Suspension of disbelief|willingly accept]] characters speaking an updated language, and modern [[slang]] and figures of speech are often used in these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-3-26-00-on-language-anachronism.html|title=The Way We Live Now: 3-26-00: On Language; Anachronism |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2000-03-26|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subconscious anachronism==
[[File:RR5011-0017R.gif|thumbnail|right|A Russian commemorative coin depicting the meeting of Soviet and American troops at [[Torgau]] in 1945 shows the 50-star [[flag of the United States of America]], a flag not in use until 1960. The US flag used during the Second World War had 48 stars.]]

Unintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records or representations of historic artifacts and artworks, because the recorder's perspective is conditioned by the assumptions and practices of his or her own times (a form of [[cultural bias]]). One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and figures in [[Medieval stained glass|stained glass]] in records made by English [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have subconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which it was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver D. |title=Beards: true and false |journal=Church Monuments |volume=28 |year=2013 |pages=124–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time travel==
The extensive science fiction subgenre depicting [[Time travel in fiction| time travel]] in effect consists of deliberate, consciously created anachronisms, letting people of one time meet and interact with those of another time. Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.

== In academia ==
In historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]], first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.

The use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Detection of anachronism==

The ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. [[Anthony Grafton]] discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], of [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614), and of [[Richard August Reitzenstein|Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the "[[Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]]", through – among other techniques – the recognition of anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, pp. 75–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of [[diplomatics]], the critical analysis of the forms of documents, developed by the [[Maurist]] scholar [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707) and his successors [[René-Prosper Tassin]] (1697–1777) and [[Charles-François Toustain]] (1700–1754). The philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The falsehood of a writing will often be detected, by its making direct mention of, or allusions more or less indirect to, some fact posterior to the date which it bears. ... ''The mention of posterior facts;'' – first indication of forgery.&lt;br&gt;

In a living language there are always variations in words, in the meaning of words, in the construction of phrases, in the manner of spelling, which may detect the age of a writing, and lead to legitimate suspicions of forgery. ... ''The use of words not used till after the date of the writing;'' – second indication of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |authorlink=Jeremy Bentham |title=A Treatise on Judicial Evidence |editor-first=Étienne |editor-last=Dumont |editor-link=Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont |place=London |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock and Joy |year=1825 |page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMsDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exposure by [[Lorenzo Valla]] in 1440 of the so-called [[Donation of Constantine]], a decree purportedly issued by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] in either 315 or 317 AD, as a later forgery, depended to a considerable degree on the identification of anachronisms, such as references to the city of [[Constantinople]] (a name not in fact bestowed until 330 AD). A large number of apparent [[anachronisms in the Book of Mormon]] have served to convince critics that the book was written in the 19th century, and not, as its adherents claim, in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] terminology demonstrates that the purported "[[Franklin Prophecy]]" (attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], who died in 1790) is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Myth: The Franklin "Prophecy" |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ""[[William Lynch speech]]", an address, supposedly delivered in 1712, on the control of slaves in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], is now considered to be a 20th-century forgery, partly on account of its use of anachronistic terms such as "program" and "refueling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch's Letter Real? |last=Cobb |first=W.

'''Blason populaire''' is an umbrella [[genre]] in the field of [[folkloristics]] used to designate any item of any genre which makes use of [[stereotype]]s, usually, but not always, negative stereotypes, of a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Lindahl, John McNamara, John Lindow, eds. Medieval Folklore: A Guide to Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs. Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;"These stereotypes are manifested in a wide array of folkloric genres, including proverbs, other traditional sayings, nicknames, jokes, songs, rhymes, and football chants. All share a common function in that they are invoked to highlight positive aspects of the in-group by explicit auto-stereotyping or, alternatively, to identify the negative characteristics of out-groups. The explicit positive stereotyping of an in-group may often implicitly suggest negative characteristics of a rival out-group."&lt;ref&gt;Marcas Mac Coinnigh. 'The Blason Populaire: Slurs and Stereotypes in Irish Proverbial Material'. ''Folklore'' 124, 2 (2013): 157-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''blasons populaires''  nations are homogeneous and have national characteristics.

Items such as [[joke#ethnic jokes|ethnic jokes]] or [[joke#blonde jokes|blonde jokes]] are very common examples of blason populaire.

== ''Blasons Populaires'' in Irish Proverbial Material ==

The Irish proverbial material is almost devoid of any national blasons populaires, with the possible exception of the multi-group international comparison. These comparisons are often manifested in epigrammatic form in European languages, with the most salient and representative stereotypical trait being attributed to the nations involved (what Billig (1995) refers to as ‘banal nationalism’). Enumerative structures, usually tri- or quadripartite formulas, are the favoured apparatus. The syntactic and semantic juxtaposition of negative traits for comparative purposes is then counter-balanced by the positive representation of one nation, usually in final position, most commonly the in-group that invokes the comparison. Below is a nineteenth-century German example (Reinsberg-Düringsfeld 1863, 5) in which there is no apparent in-group.

::''Die Italiener fluchen, Die Franzosen schreien, Die Engländer essen, Die Spanier trotzen, Und die Deutschen betrinken sich.''	
:::( The Italians curse, the French scream, the English eat, the Spanish defy, and the Germans get drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Marcas Mac Coinnigh. An Blason Populaire: Slurs and Stereotypes in Irish Proverbial Material’. Folklore 125  (2013): 1&lt;/ref&gt; )

==''Blasons populaires'' in Wallonia and Luxembourg &lt;ref&gt;http://belgique-sud-surnoms-des-habitants.skynetblogs.be/&lt;/ref&gt;==

In [[Wallonia]] ([[Belgium]]) and [[Luxembourg]], the concept of "blason populaire" refers to a [[demonym]]-like [[nickname]] of the inhabitants of a village or a city.

''Blasons populaire'' come from the traditional languages ([[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Luxembourgish]]). They are never translated in French, as opposed to the [[demonym]]s which exist in [[French language|French]] and in Walloon, often in two different constructions.

Some, which have lost their pejorative meaning, are now used to name restaurants, theater groups, communal houses, etc. They are also used in [[pseudonym]]s of writers in Walloon.

==''Blasons populaires'' in Picardie and Nord-Pas-de-Calais==

The inhabitants of all villages or cities in these regions have a ''blason populaire'' (in [[Picard language]]: ''surpitchet'').&lt;ref&gt;(in French):  André Accart, ''Les sobriquets des habitants du Pas-de-Calais'', 456  pages, ( 2006 ) {{ISBN|2-915800-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for the town of [[Amiens]] the blason is ''chés Maqueus d'gueugues d'Anmien'' ('the Eaters of Walnuts of Amiens').  In 1597, Spanish soldiers mounted [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|a surprise attack]]. They were disguised as peasants and put walnuts at the doors of the town. The inhabitants were famished and opened the doors, following which the Spanish soldiers entered the city; with deadly consequences for the inhabitants.

==Reception==
In their 2014 book ''Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact'', [[Blaise Cronin]] and Cassidy R. Sugimoto noted that "for impact assessment of book-based fields, bibliometricians need a database with large numbers of books" and that while the Book Citation Index did meet this need, [[Google Books]] also fulfilled this purpose and was not only free, but was (at the time) more comprehensive for bibliometric analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cronin|first1=Blaise|last2=Sugimoto|first2=Cassidy R.|title=Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact|date=2014|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262323291|pages=33, 289, 296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxSaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=%22Book+Citation+Index%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ig9sVZ2QB4rLsASwyYHYBw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Book%20Citation%20Index%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article in the ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'' remarked on the index's opportunities and limitations. It stated that the "most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information, the inflation of publication counts, the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels, and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index."&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorraiz|first1=Juan|last2=Purnell|first2=Philip J.|last3=Glänze|first3=Wolfgang|title=Opportunities for and limitations of the Book Citation Index|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=July 2013|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1388–1398|doi=10.1002/asi.22875|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22875/full|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the Book Citation Index was "a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs — a very challenging issue, because, unlike journals and conference proceedings, books have specific requirements, and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification, but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications."&lt;ref name=journal /&gt;

'''Came glasswork''' is the process of joining cut pieces of [[art glass]] through the use of [[came]] strips or foil into picturesque designs in a framework of soldered metal.

Final products include a wide range of glasswork, including [[stained glass]] and [[leadlight|lead light]] pieces. Came is made of different metals, such as [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[brass]] and [[copper]]. The metal came selected generally depends upon the size, complexity and weight of the project. As an alternative to came, copper foil may be used, for small, intricate pieces.

==Overview==
Came glasswork includes assembling pieces of cut and possibly painted [[Art glass|glass]] using [[came]] sections. The joints where the came meet are [[solder]]ed to bind the sections. When all of the glass pieces have been put within came and a border put around the entire work, pieces are [[cement]]ed and supported as needed.&lt;ref name=Shannon/&gt; The work may be made [[waterproof]] by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. A form of [[embellishment]] and [[gilding]], such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]], may be added to finish the piece.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Works may need to be reinforced, like large pieces or ones that will be exposed to the outdoor elements. Support can be provided as the piece is made through the use of reinforced and metal-covered lead came, the use of steel strips in the came channels, or use of rigid cames, such as [[copper]], [[brass]] or [[zinc]]. Bars of steel or [[steel]] [[rebar]] may be attached to the back of finished works as reinforcement.&lt;ref name=Shannon60&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 60. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Theophilus Presbyter]], the first to write about joining art glass using the came technique&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Daniel and Susan Chace. (editors). (1979). ''Reader's Digest Crafts &amp; Hobbies''. Readers Digest. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-89577-063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the book ''De Divers Artibus''. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk who was a glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley, J. et al. (1998). Back to the Roots: The Raw Materials, Glass Recipes and Glassmaking Practices of Theophilus. In: McCray, P. (ed). ''The Prehistory and History of Ancient Glassmaking''. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, I. (1992). ''Theophilus and the Composition of Medieval Glass, Materials Issues in Art and Archaeology III''. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Materials Research Society. p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Materials to complete a glasswork project may include the [[pattern]], [[Art glass|cut glass]], [[came]], [[wood]] [[Molding (decorative)|trim]], [[solder]], [[cement]]. Additional supplies include [[newspaper]], cutter oil, a [[plywood]] board, [[masking tape]], flux,{{refn|Flux is used during the soldering process to better disperse heat from the soldering iron, improve the soldering process and to clean. Care should be taken to avoid contact to the skin or inhalation of its fumes.&lt;ref name=Stevenson14&gt;Stevenson, Christine. (2004). ''Creative Stained Glass: Modern Designs &amp; Simple Techniques''. Lark Books. p. 14. {{ISBN|1-57990-487-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} and [[Calcium carbonate|whiting]].&lt;ref name=Shannon52&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Whiting has two purposes. It is used to seal the glaze or cement. It is also used to clean residue off of the came and the project.&lt;ref name=Stevenson14/&gt;|group=nb}}

===Came===
Lead came is often supplied in lengths of 2&amp;nbsp;m and in widths of differing sizes. It also comes in flat or domed profiles.

====Brass and copper====
Brass and copper have been used to bring a copper or golden hue to the works.&lt;ref name=Berry10&gt;Berry, Leigh Ann. (2003). ''Basic Stained Glass Making: All the Skills and Tools You Need to Get Started''. Stackpole Books. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8117-2846-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, though, they were used only for windows between about 1890 and 1920. Both metals were often alternatives to zinc for [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed windows.&lt;ref name=DOI&gt;Department of Interior. (2004). ''The Preservation of Historic Architecture: The U.S. Government's Official Guidelines for Preserving Historic Homes''. Lyons Press Series. Globe Pequot. p. 397. {{ISBN|1-59228-126-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz/&gt;

====Brass-capped lead====
Brass-capped lead is another type of came used for glasswork projects.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;

====Lead====
The traditional method of creating "camework glass" uses [[lead]] [[came]], which ages into a dark blue-gray [[patina]]. In comparison to other came metal strips, like brass, copper and zinc, lead is softer and more flexible, making it easier to cut and bend. It's also inexpensive and durable. A downside is that the finished projects may be prone to sagging due to lead's softness. This can be mitigated somewhat by stretching the lead to make it more rigid before it is used.&lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 51. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12&gt;Stevenson, Christine. (2004). ''Creative Stained Glass: Modern Designs &amp; Simple Techniques''. Lark Books. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-57990-487-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Special precautions should be taken when working with this metal came to avoid to lead contamination.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;

The lead came windows of the medieval churches are sturdier than those of the 19th century and much of the 20th century. The composition of lead came changed over time, at first by removing other metals to make a "pure lead" and then again during war years when lead was needed for ammunition. Since the 1970s a new form of lead, restoration lead, was developed based upon medieval lead's metal composition. Restoration lead is stronger than lead came of the prior 100 years or so.&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;

Water tightness is achieved by brushing [[adhesive|cement]] under the flanges of the leads to both faces prior to installation or by applying [[putty]] afterwards. Typically the cement consisted of [[linseed oil]], [[Chalk|whiting]], [[lamp black]] and [[white spirit]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Zinc====
Zinc makes a lightweight, strong and rigid came, which lends itself to glasswork projects that don't have many curved lines, are large, or have a number of straight lines that require greater support than lead would afford. Zinc accepts finishes, such as black and copper. Because of its strength, zinc is often used for border cames, which are U-channel cames for the outside edges.&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 55-60. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Lloyd Wright used zinc came for his stained glass windows.&lt;ref name=Heinz&gt;Heinz, Thomas A. (September / October 1989). "Use &amp; Repair of Zinc Cames in Art-Glass Windows." ''Old House Journal''. pp. 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beveled glass]] work is generally done in zinc came, primarily because of its ability to manage the weight of heavy plate glass; whereas beveled glass works made of lead came are much more likely to buckle or sag over time.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Anita and Seymour Isenberg. (2002). ''How to Work in Beveled Glass: Forming, Designing, and Fabricating''. Dover Stained Glass Instruction Series. Courier Dover Publications. p. 21. {{ISBN|0-486-42062-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an example of copper foil glasswork, an alternative to came glasswork.]]

Copper foil is an easy, versatile alternative to came and is particularly useful for small projects.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt; Using [[copper]] [[foil (chemistry)|foil]], the edges of the glass pieces are wrapped with adhesive copper tape and [[soldering|soldered]] together along the adjacent copper strips. The copper foil technique (commonly called [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|''Tiffany'']] stained glass, even though there is a debate about whether [[John La Farge]] or [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] originated it) was invented in the 19th century, enabling creation of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] works, in addition to [[two-dimensional]] ones to which the lead came method is limited. A patent for the method of "Joining Glass Mosaics" was issued to Sanford Bray in 1886. This new method of joining pieces of stained glass used copper/copper foil instead of lead sashes. By using copper foil, one could now make cylinders, cones, and globe-shaped shades or many other irregular forms.

A '''capsule review''' is a form of criticism, usually associated with journalism, that offers a relatively short critique of a specified artistic work ([[movie]], [[music album]], [[restaurant]], [[painting]], etc.).  Capsule reviews generally appear in publications like newspapers and magazines, and can range anywhere from just a few sentences up to around 300 words.

''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'' is a famous publication that includes hundreds of capsule movie reviews by prolific film writer Leonard Maltin, including the world's shortest capsule review according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'', a 2 out of 4 star review of the 1948 musical ''[[Isn't It Romantic? (1948 film)|Isn't It Romantic?]]'' that consisted of only the word "no".

'''Chip art''', also known as '''silicon art''', '''chip graffiti''' or '''silicon doodling''', refers to microscopic artwork built into [[integrated circuits]], also called chips or ICs.  Since ICs are printed by [[photolithography]], not constructed a component at a time, there is no additional cost to include features in otherwise unused space on the chip.  Designers have used this freedom to put all sorts of artwork on the chips themselves, from designers' simple initials to rather complex drawings.  Given the small size of chips, these figures cannot be seen without a [[microscope]].  Chip graffiti is sometimes called the hardware version of [[Easter egg (media)|software easter eggs]].

Prior to 1984, these doodles also served a practical purpose.  If a competitor produced a similar chip, and examination showed it contained the same doodles, then this was strong evidence that the design was copied (a [[copyright]] violation) and not independently derived.  A 1984 revision of the US copyright law (the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]]) made all [[mask work|chip masks automatically copyrighted]], with exclusive rights to the creator, and similar rules apply in most other countries that manufacture ICs.  Since an exact copy is now automatically a copyright violation, the doodles serve no useful purpose.

==Creating chip art==
[[Image:ChipWorksLandShark.jpg|left|thumb|Image of a [[Land Shark (Saturday Night Live)|Land Shark]] from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' inside an [[Analog Devices]] AD1939 chip.]]
Integrated Circuits are constructed from multiple layers of material, typically [[silicon]], [[silicon dioxide]] ([[glass]]), and [[aluminium|aluminum]]. The composition and thickness of these layers give them their distinctive color and appearance. These elements created an irresistible palette for IC design and layout engineers. 

The creative process involved in the design of these chips, a strong sense of pride in their work, and an artistic temperament combined compels people to want to mark their work as their own. It is very common to find initials, or groups of initials on chips. This is the design engineer's way of "signing" his or her work.

Often this creative artist's instinct extends to the inclusion of small pictures or icons. These may be images of significance to the designers, comments related to the chip's function, [[inside jokes]], or even [[satirical]] references. Because of the difficulty in verifying their existence, chip art has also been the subject of online hoaxes (e.g. the never-seen "[[Bill Gates|bill]] sux" comment on a [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] chip&amp;mdash;the reputed "photo" showing the inscription is a hoax&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.snopes.com/business/hidden/chipshot.asp an account of "Bill Sux" as an urban legend.]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The mass production of these works of art as parasites on the body of a commercial IC goes unnoticed by most observers and is discouraged by semiconductor corporations, primarily from the fear that the presence of the artwork (which is clearly unneeded) will interfere with some necessary function in the chip or design flow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/the-secret-art-of-chip-graffiti The Secret Art of Chip Graffiti] ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' article on chip artwork, by H. Goldstein, Volume: 39, Issue: 3, Mar 2002, pp. 50-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some laboratories have started collaborating with artists or directly producing books and exhibits with the micrographs of these chips. Such is the case of [[Harvard]] chemist [[George M. Whitesides|George Whitesides]], who collaborated with pioneer photographer [[Felice Frankel]] to publish ''On the Surface of Things'', a highly praised photography book on experiments from (mostly) the Whitesides lab. Also, the laboratory of [[Albert Folch Folch|Albert Folch]] (who, perhaps not coincidentally, works in [[BioMEMS]], the same field as George Whitesides) at the [[University of Washington]]'s Bioengineering Dept. has a highly popular online gallery with more than 1,700 free [[BioMEMS]]-related chip art micrographs and has already produced three art exhibits in the Seattle area, with online sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/afolch/FolchLabART.html Folch Lab ART Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is most closely associated with the artwork of American artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]] (1925–2008) who coined the phrase&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/arts/design/adding-rauschenberg-and-richter-at-moma.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'' October 24 2013 "“We are fortunate to have six Combines from the mid-’50s through 1961,” Ms. Temkin said, referring to the term Rauschenberg coined to describe works that incorporate castoff objects like tires, flatware or furniture."]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his own creations. Rauschenberg’s Combines explored the blurry boundaries between art and the everyday world. In addition, his cross-medium creations challenged the doctrine of [[medium specificity]] mentioned by modernist art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]. [[Frank Stella]] created a large body of paintings that recall the combine paintings of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] by juxtaposing a wide variety of surface and material in each work ultimately leading to Stella's sculpture and architecture of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haberarts.com/schwitt.htm Unhappy Medium, Frank Stella and Kurt Schwitters by John Haber].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Schimmel of the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] described Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' as "some of the most influential, poetic and revolutionary works in the history of American art."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; But they've also been called "ramshackle hybrids between painting and sculpture, stage prop and three-dimensional scrap-book assemblage" according to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s critic Adrian Searle.&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Searle believed the "different elements of the Combines have been described as having no more relation than the different stories that vie for attention on a newspaper page."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Jasper Johns, as well, used similar techniques; in at least one painting, Johns attached a paintbrush right inside his painting.

Examples of Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' include ''Bed'' (1955), ''Canyon'' (1959), and the free-standing ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]'' (1955–1959).&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg's works mostly incorporated [[two-dimensional]] materials held together with "splashes and drips of paint" with occasional 3-D objects.&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Critic John Perreault wrote "The Combines are both painting and sculpture–or, some purists would say, neither."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Perreault liked them since they were memorable, photogenic, and could "stick in the mind" as well as "surprise and keep on surprising."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg added stuffed birds on his 1955 work ''Satellite'', which featured a stuffed pheasant "patrolling its top edge."&lt;ref name=tws08jan011/&gt; In another work, he added a ladder.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, his ''Broadcast'' had three radios playing simultaneously, which produced a sort of irritating static, so that one of the work's owners, at one point, replaced the "noise" with tapes of actual programs when guests visited.&lt;ref name=tws08jan012/&gt; Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' had a pillow attached to a patchwork quilt with paint splashed over it.&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt; The idea was to promote immediacy.&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt;

The prevailing theme of Rauschenberg's "combine" paintings is ''"nonmeaning, the absurd, or antiart."'' In this regard the combine paintings relate to [[Pop art]] and their much earlier predecessor [[Dada]].&lt;ref&gt;Varieties of Visual Experience, Edmund Burke Feldman, Harry N.

]]
''Canyon,'' one of Rauschenberg's most recognizable Combines, has been the subject of art historical debate revolving around the validity of reading Rauschenberg's work iconographically. Historian [[Kenneth Bendiner]] famously proposed ''Canyon'' as a playful recreation of a 1635 [[Rembrandt]] painting depicting the abduction of [[The Abduction of Ganymede|Ganymede]], interpreting the suspended pillow as Ganymede's buttocks and the stuffed bald eagle as the form assumed by the Greek god Zeus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Rauschenberg and the Neo-Avant-Garde|last=Branden|first=Joseph|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians and critics, such as [[Joseph Branden]] have argued that searching for iconography in Rauschenberg's Combines is useless because it can be made to exist anywhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bendiner's interpretation is discredited for failing to account for compositional movement and for disregarding a number of elements within the work, for example the blue and red text in the center, in order to mould the interpretation to it.

Interpretations of Rauschenberg's Combines vary from: a deeply personal and subjective collage of expression (often homoerotic), to a surface of indecipherable, or rather infinitely cipher-able, materials which challenge notions of painting, sculpture, reception, and chance, to a multivalent iconographic landscape that seems to resist fixed decoding in favor of a more open-ended play of meaning. Rauschenberg himself states "I don't want a painting to be just an expression of my personality. I feel it ought to be much better than that … I’ve always felt as though, whatever I’ve used and whatever I’ve done, the method was always closer to a ''collaboration'' with materials than to any kind of conscious manipulation and control."&lt;ref&gt;Rauschenberg quoted in Calvin Tomkins, ‘Profiles: Moving Out,’ ''The New Yorker'', vol.40, 29 Feb. 1964, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moira Roth]] links the Combines to [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] indifferent attitude in art, arguing that the perceived density of the content, and the integration of mass media elements is a facade born out of the alienation and indifference experienced by the artist during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]]. Jonathan Katz argues that underneath the impersonal and inexpressive appearance of his work is a secret homosexual code that can unlock some of the significance of Rauschenberg's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Katz: ‘Lovers and Divers’ (1998) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; but Ed Krčma points out the weakness of steering the analysis towards preconceived conclusions, especially since Rauschenberg's work is described as a poetry of infinite possibilities.

More recent interpretations of ''Canyon,'' reconsider the work in [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] terms, claiming that the Combine works more like a human mind than a human eye; Fragmented scraps of images, news cutouts, found objects and paint interact in esoteric ways and more closely resemble a cerebral process than a 'traditional' image. Yve-Alain Bois calls the search for iconographic meaning in Rauschenberg's work misguided because it is too limiting. His art's "lack of center" is a statement in itself, and the infinite permutations of meaning that can result highlight the subjectivity of art reception that postmodernism explores.&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain. "Eye to the Ground." Artforum International. Artforum Inc. March, 2006. p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional note===

Under U.S. law, ''Canyon'' can never be sold since it contains a stuffed bald eagle, violating the 1940 [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]] as well as the 1918 [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/05/01/rauschenberg-eagle-ruffles-feathers/|title=Rauschenberg Eagle Ruffles Feathers|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=January 5, 2012|website=Art News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was defined in the late-1960s and spawned a movement which grew in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Scandinavia]], the term "community art" means more often contemporary art project.

Often community art is based in economically deprived areas, with a community-oriented, grassroots approach. Members of a local community will come together to express concerns or issues through an artistic process, sometimes this may involve professional artists or actors. These communal artistic processes act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or even at a national or international level.

In English-speaking countries, community art is often seen as the work of community [[arts centre]]. [[Visual arts]] ([[fine art]], video, [[new media art]]), music, and theater are common mediums in community art centers. Many arts companies in the UK do some community-based work, which typically involves developing participation by non-professional members of local communities.

== Community art and public art ==
The term "community art" refers also to the field of community, neighbourhood and public art practice with roots in social justice and popular and informal education methods. In the art world, community art signifies a particular art making practice, emphasizing community involvement and collaboration. Community art is most often art for social change and involves some empowerment of the community members who come together to create artwork/s with artists. This is a growing national, international, regional and local field. Recently community arts and sustainability work or environmental action have begun to interface, including urban revitalization projects creating artwork at a neighbourhood level.

== Forms of Collaborative Practices ==
Models of community-engaged arts can vary with three forms of collaborative practices emerging from among the sets of common practices. In the artist-driven model, artists are seen as the catalysts for social change through the social commentary addressed in their works. A muralist whose work elicits and sustains political dialogue would be a practitioner of this model. In the second model, artists engage with community groups to facilitate specialized forms of art creation, often with the goal of presenting the work in a public forum to promote awareness and to further discourse within a larger community. In the process-driven or dialogic model, artists may engage with a group in order to facilitate an artistic process that addresses particular concerns specific to the group. The use of an artistic process (such as dance or [[Social Circus|social circus]]) for problem-solving, therapeutic, group-empowerment or strategic planning purposes may result in artistic works that are not intended for public presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icasc.ca/what-art-social-change|title=What is Art for Social Change? {{!}} Art for Social Change|website=icasc.ca|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second and third models, the individuals who collaborate on the artistic creation may not define themselves as artists but are considered practitioners of an art-making process that produces social change.

Due to its roots in social justice and collaborative, community-based nature, art for social change may be considered a form of cultural democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melucci|first=Alberto|last2=Avritzer|first2=Leonardo|date=2000-12-01|title=Complexity, cultural pluralism and democracy: collective action in the public space|url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/39/4/507|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=507–527|doi=10.1177/053901800039004001|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, the processes (or the works produced by these processes) intend to create or promote spaces for participatory public dialogue.

In Canada, the field of community-engaged arts has recently seen broader use of art for social change practices by non-arts change organizations. The resultant partnerships have enabled these collaborative communities to address systemic issues in health, education, as well as empowerment for indigenous, immigrant, LGBT and youth communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf http://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar social innovation trend has appeared where business development associations have engaged with artists/artistic organizations to co-produce cultural festivals or events that address social concerns.

As the field diversifies and practices are adopted by various organizations from multiple disciplines, ethics and safety have become a concern to practitioners.[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-016-9257-7?wt_mc=internal.event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst] As a result, opportunities for cross-disciplinary training in art for social change practices have grown within the related field of [[Arts in education|arts education]].

== Online community art ==
A [[community]] can be seen in many ways, it can refer to different kind of groups. There are also [[virtual communities]] or online communities.  [[Internet art]] has many different forms, but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project.

==Community theatre==
[[Community theatre]] includes theatre made by, with, and for a community—it may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help, or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community. Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time professional staff. Community theatre is often [[devised theatre|devised]] and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as [[carnival]], [[circus]], and [[parade]]s, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre. Community theatre is understood to contribute to the [[social capital]] of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience-members.

The '''Cultural Medallion''' is a [[Singapore]] cultural award conferred to those who have achieved artistic excellence in [[dance]], [[theatre]], [[Literature of Singapore|literature]], [[Music of Singapore|music]], [[photography]], [[art]] and [[Cinema of Singapore|film]]. It is widely recognized as Singapore's pinnacle arts award.

It was instituted in March 1979 as an initiative of the late [[President of Singapore|President]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]] who was the then Minister for Culture. It is administered by the [[National Arts Council Singapore|National Arts Council]].

On 20 October 2006, [[Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts]] [[Dr Lee Boon Yang]] announced that Cultural Medallion recipients are eligible for a project grant of up to S$80,000 each, up from S$50,000. The increase would enable recipients to create major new works.&lt;ref name="Clara"&gt;Clara Chow, "SSO co-leader, versatile artist get highest award for the arts", ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

It was previously conferred by the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (the modern equivalent of the Minister for Culture). However, in 2006, the status of the award was further elevated by being conferred by the President of Singapore.

From 2013, in an effort to recognise multi-disciplinary artists, it was announced that recipients of the Cultural Medallion and Young Artist Award will no longer be categorised according to art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Medallion &amp; Young Artist Award Winners|url=https://www.nac.gov.sg/docs/cmyaa/past-recipients_2014.pdf|website=National Arts Council|publisher=National Arts Council|accessdate=2 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903112331/https://www.nac.gov.sg/docs/cmyaa/past-recipients_2014.pdf|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article is concerned with cultural resources in the widest sense: for traditional, archaeological and historic culture specifically, also see [[cultural heritage management]]''

In the broadest sense, '''cultural resources management''' ('''CRM''') is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as [[the arts]] and [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of [[archaeology]].  Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as [[urban culture]], rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.

However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with [[heritage management]]. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, "used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws." &lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural resources include both physical assets such as [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s and also [[intangible culture]] such as [[folklore]] and interpretative arts, such as [[storytelling]] and [[drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Research/det/glossary_abbreviations.htm UK definition of cultural sector]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of [[museum]]s, [[art museum|galleries]], [[theatre]]s etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group.  [[Cultural tourism]] is a significant sector of the tourism industry.

At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as [[language]]s in danger of extinction, [[public education]], the ethos or operation of [[multiculturalism]], and promoting access to cultural resources.  The [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] is an attempt by the [[United Nations]] to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

==Background==
Cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment/conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating “growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the [[Antiquities Act]], but it was not until the 1970s when the term “cultural resources” was coined by the National Park Service. This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974: the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Following these conferences, the National Park Service (NPS) defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being:

“Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture…[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural resources management applied to heritage management==
{{main article|Cultural heritage management}}
'''Cultural resources management''' in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people.  The subject developed from initiatives in [[rescue archaeology]], sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.

In the 1970s, archaeologists created the term "cultural resource management" as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources:&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historic properties (as listed or eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]])
* Older properties that may have cultural value, but may or may not be eligible for the National Register
* Historic properties that have cultural value beyond their historicity
* Archeological graves and cultural items
* Shipwrecks
* Museum collections
* Historical documents
* Religious sites
* Religious practices
* Cultural use of natural resources
* Folklife, tradition, and other social institutions
* Theater groups, orchestras, and other community cultural amenities

A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~dap/daddy/daddy.html "Who's my Daddy? Who's my Mommy?] Results of a Poll on the Origins of Private-Sector CRM," by David A. Phillips, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acra-crm.org Web site of the American Cultural Resources Association]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum]]s, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.

==National Register eligibility==
In the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This process commonly entails one or more [[archaeological field survey]]s.

==Careers in CRM==
Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.

In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources.&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP), or the [[state historic preservation office]] (SHPO) Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see [[shovelbum]]) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work.  One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 241, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be “interpreted in different ways so that the significance… may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that arises among scholars is that “protection does not necessarily mean preservation.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of cultural organizations==
The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416204313/http://www.aandb.org.uk/ Arts and Business] which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations.  Some universities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 BA in Cultural Resources Management at Dundalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207233207/http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmu.ac.uk/faculties/humanities/pg/ma/ecp_course_overview.jsp MA in European Cultural Planning at De Montfort]&lt;/ref&gt; now offer vocational degrees.

The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]] and [[history]].  The broader subject is also underpinned by research in [[sociology]] and [[culture studies]].

==Anthropology==
{{main article|Cultural anthropology}}
Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples (Indigenous or not) is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.

==Cultural resources policies==
Cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/ Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world.  The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial.  On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry.  Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.

A '''cultural subsidy''' is a payment from the government to specific cultural industries to ensure that some public policy purpose in culture (e.g. [[multiculturalism]], [[bilingualism]], minority and languages, and preservation of traditional dance, music, food, art or other practices) are preserved and maintained in society. Cultural subsidies work similarly to other forms of [[subsidies]] such as industrial and consumer subsidies and have similar goals of expansionary economic results and increased utility for their targeted recipients.

'''Implementation:''' Cultural subsidies are distributed in the form of grants and payment from the government to various institutions, groups or citizens who are seen to meaningfully contribute to their society's culture. Some of the most familiar efforts are: free museum entrances for children and seniors, public art instalments, government funding for afterschool art-based programs and government grants to culturally focused non-profits.

A common emphasis for cultural subsidies is the provision of resources for underserved communities or groups, whose cultural background and heritage may be at risk without additional financial support, or who traditionally lack access to mainstream cultural events and participation. For example, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] states that 40% of their activities support high-poverty neighbourhoods, 36% of their grants are awarded to organisations that serve those with disabilities, in institutions and veterans, while 33% of their grants are awarded to serve low-income audiences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/NEA_Quick_Facts_v.2.pdf|title=The National Endowment for the Arts|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Subsidy Implementation in the US'''

The National Council for the Arts was established by US [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] through the National Arts and Cultural Development Act of 1964 and is the US federal program which provides cultural subsidies. Its purpose is to review and recommend applications for grants, funding guidelines and leadership initiatives in the US. to the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. There are eighteen Presidentially appointed members of the council, with six additional members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] serving two-year, non-voting terms. Members are selected for their extensive knowledge, expertise and interest in the arts as well as outstanding backgrounds in service or recognition within the arts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The annual budget for the National Council for the Arts is set by Congress and currently receives .004% of the total, or 149.8 million USD. 40% of their grant budget is directly received by states via regional arts agencies who distribute the funds, with stipulations that every state and regional partnership allocates a portion of funding for underserved communities. Direct awards to organisations and individuals who apply through the National Endowment for the Arts make up the remaining 60% of their annual budget.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Intended Economic Effects'''

Like other subsidies, cultural subsidies are utilized with the intent to expand economic growth and utility within a specific area. The functionality of cultural subsidies can be seen through typical [[Supply and demand|supply and demand graphs]] like those pictured below.

As prices for arts and culture related items, events and classes increase, the demand for them decreases. On the other hand, as prices increase, the supply also increases as more artists and cultural entities seek gains. Where the two forces of supply and demand meet is the equilibrium point (e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artspolicies.org/2011/06/17/modelling-the-economic-impacts-of-cultural-policies/|title=Artspolicies.org|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cultural Sector No Subsidy.png|border|Cultural Sector No Subsidy]]

When cultural subsidies are applied from the demand-side that means they focus on growing the demand from consumers for art and culture related products. This most often is reflected in free or discounted ticket sales for art and culture events and purchases for pieces of art that consumers would otherwise not be able to buy due to budget constraints. The ultimate goal in utilising demand-side cultural subsidies is to increase the demand for art at every price level it is offered. Below, we can see the result is an outward shift of the demand curve to the right, and an increase in both the equilibrium supply ''and'' demand (e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The difference from P&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the amount which is compensated by the subsidy, and the total area of from P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the cultural sector's revenue. Demand-side subsidies are typically viewed as an effective way to increase both the output of the cultural sector and increase incomes for the providers within it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Cultural Sector Demand Impact.png|border|Cultural Sector Demand Impact]]

Governments can also approach cultural subsidies from the supply-side in an effort to increase the economic power of those who supply cultural products. This allows cultural providers the opportunity to produce and supply more than they would be able to without subsidised assistance. Instead of raising both the price and quantity of cultural products, as the demand-side subsidies do, supply-side subsidies lower price while increasing quantity, as show in the model below. Supply shifts downward, to the right and the new equilibrium moves from e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Total revenue shifts from the blue rectangle to the red rectangle, which demonstrates an expansion of cultural sector output (Q&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but not necessarily an increase in economic growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Cultural Sector Supply Impact.png|border|Cultural Sector Supply Impact]]

'''Issues facing cultural subsidies'''

As with other sectors reliant on subsidies, the cultural sector is constantly subject to the budget decisions made by the government. In the US, government subsidies for arts and culture have steadily been declining as spending emphasis shifts elsewhere. Cultural providers are forced to turn to state and private philanthropic groups and individuals for greater and greater percentages of their funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cultureforward.org/news/CPAC-Media-Releases/As-threats-to-federal-arts-funding-persist-new-study-demonstrates-vital-role-of-government-funding-to-local-arts-and-culture-nonprofits|title=cultureforward.org|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the current US administration of [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]], there have been proposals to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, the US grant-making organisation responsible for cultural subsidy provision. The main argument behind this comes from the [[Taxation in the United States|private taxation]] of citizens to fund the program. Policymakers in favour of reduced taxes often view cultural subsidies as a non-necessary expense, and one which should be privately, versus publicly funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/142925/americans-hostile-state-funded-art|title=newrepublic.com|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions on the importance of cultural subsidies vary widely by each nation, as well as the levels of investment in cultural products by consumers and cultural professions by suppliers. In Australia, there is a current over-supply in the cultural sector which has been supported through supply-side subsidies from the government. This issue, paired with a drastic increase in the number of cultural professionals in the early 2000s, has been blamed for steadily declining salaries for cultural suppliers. Advocates for reform are stressing the importance of demand-side policies in the country as an alternative way to increase artist salary and most importantly, increase demand for the large supply of cultural products available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culture360.asef.org/magazine/policies-boosting-arts-demand|title=culture360.asef.org|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cutup''' is a group of London-based artists, whose work mainly revolves around the manipulation of [[billboard]] [[advertisements]]. Their first works consisted of removing a billboard, painstakingly cutting it up into roughly 4000 small rectangles, each one in essence a [[pixel]], and then reassembling the billboard.

More recently, Cutup have started other projects, such as replacing small bus-shelter advertisements with a drilled sheet of wood. The illuminating back lights that turn on at dusk reveal an image, as the many holes light up against the dark background.

Although they mainly deal with art on the street, the group have also created installations, including setting 96 different alarm clocks one a minute apart and sound installations, made up of 94 speakers, mini disks and circuit boards.

==Shows and exhibitions==
Cutup have held shows in London, New York and Barcelona, including two shows at London's [[Seventeen Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.17space.com/index.php?p=3&amp;id=3 Seventeen Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; including a recent show which exhibited a full size billboard and a bus shelter, brought inside especially for the show, as well as related video and film pieces.

Other shows have included "La Vida Te Espera" at [[NIU Gallery]], Barcelona in June 2006, "Satellites", at [[Tanya Bonakdar Gallery]], New York and a show at the Kemistry Gallery in Shoreditch.

'''The Dark Watchers''' (also known by early Spanish settlers as '''Los Vigilantes Oscuros''') is a name given to a group of entities in [[California]] [[folklore]] purportedly seen observing travelers along the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]].

==Description==
The Dark Watchers are described as tall, sometimes giant sized featureless dark silhouettes often adorned with brimmed hats or walking sticks.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} They are most often reported to be seen in the hours around [[twilight]] and [[dawn]]. They are said to motionlessly watch travelers from the horizon along the [[Santa Lucia Mountain Range]]. According to legend no one has seen one up close and if someone were to approach them they disappear.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4522|number=522|date=7 June 2016|title=Dark Watchers|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
While sometimes attributed to the [[Chumash people]] who historically inhabited the central and southern coastal regions of California, nothing analogous to the legend appears to exist in their mythology.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarringtonBlackburn1975"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=John P.|last2=Blackburn|first2=Thomas C.|title=December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2lC7XcLrzoC|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02930-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Spanish Settlers first moved into the area they were said to have witnessed the Dark Watchers whom they dubbed Los Vigilantes Oscuros.&lt;ref name="independent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/nov/13/search-dark-watchers/|title=In Search of the Dark Watchers|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=13 November 2014|first=Mitchell|last= Kriegman}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2018}}

The Dark Watchers are most famously given a brief mention in [[John Steinbeck]]'s "[[Flight (Steinbeck story)|Flight]]", included in the 1938 collection of his short stories, ''[[The Long Valley]]'':
{{quote|"Pepé looked suspiciously back every minute or so, and his eyes sought the tops of the ridges ahead. Once, on a white barren spur, he saw a black figure for a moment; but he looked quickly away, for it was one of the dark watchers. No one knew who the watchers were, nor where they lived, but it was better to ignore them and never to show interest in them. They did not bother one who stayed on the trail and minded his own business."||}}

Along with this, "watchers" are also referenced by poet [[Robinson Jeffers]] in the titular poem of his 1937 collection ''Such Counsels You Gave to Me &amp; Other Poems'':&lt;ref name="JeffersHunt1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffers|first1=Robinson|last2=Hunt|first2=Tim|title=The Collected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers: 1928-1938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTn_okYQeW0C&amp;pg=PA562|year=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1723-6|page=562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weirdca.com/location.php?location=179 |title=Dark Watchers |date=8 May 2007 |last=Parzanese |first=Joe |website=Weird California}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{quote|...he thought it might be one of the watchers, who are often seen in this length of coast-range, forms that look human to human eyes, but certainly are not human. They come from behind ridges to watch.

The '''Decadent Movement''' was a late 19th-century [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[literary movement|literary]] movement, centered in [[Western Europe]], that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The visual artist [[Félicien Rops]]'s body of work and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]'s novel ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement. It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Critical Theory - Oxford Reference, pp.113-114&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was characterized by self-disgust, sickness at the world, general skepticism, delight in perversion and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of [[human creativity]] over logic and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Symbolist Landscapes: The Place of Painting in the Poetry and Criticism of Mallarmé and His Circle|last=Kearns|first=James|publisher=MHRA|year=1989|isbn=094762323X|location=|pages=15|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the Grain|last=Huysmans|first=Joris-Karl|publisher=Lieber &amp; Lewis|year=1922|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from the writings of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher who suggested that the decline (''[[decadence|décadence]]'') of the Roman Empire was in large part due to their moral decay and loss of cultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.constitution.org/cm/ccgrd_l.htm|title=Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline|last=Montesqieu|first=Charles-Louis de Secondat|publisher=The Free Press, New York.  Collier-Macmillan, London.|others=Translated by David Lowenthal|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Constitution Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Latin scholar [[Désiré Nisard]] turned toward French literature, he compared [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure.  The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language were the seeds of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desmarais|first=Jane|date=|year=2013|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Perfume Clouds: Olfaction, Memory, and Desire in Arthur Symon's London Nights (1895)|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|page=|pages=62–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Decadent Movement ===
The first major development in French decadence would come when writers [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] used the word proudly, to represent a rejection of what they considered banal "progress."&lt;ref name="Drowninginlimbo"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0947757813|title=An anthology of French symbolist &amp; decadent writing|publisher=Atlas Press|year=1994|isbn=0947757813|page=12|author=Remy de Gourmont|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of [[Les Fleurs du mal|''Les Fleurs du Mal'']] and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He would later use the term ''decadence'' to  include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism|last=Calinescu|first=Matei|publisher=Duke University|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 ''Les Fleurs du Mal,'' Gautier at first rejects the application of the term  decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gautier|first=Theophile|year=1868|others=Collection authored by Charles Baudelaire|title=Charles Baudelaire|url=|journal=Les Fleurs du Mal|volume=|pages=|via=WikiSource (France)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was Belgian, [[Félicien Rops]] was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent Movement.  A friend of Baudelaire,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Censorship Effect: Baudelaire, Flaubert, and the Formation of French Modernism|last=Olmsted|first=William|publisher=Oxford|year=2016|isbn=9780190238636|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself.  Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror.  He was explicitly interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egoists, a Book of Supermen: Stendahl, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Anatole France, Huysmans, Barrès, Nietzsche, Blake, Ibsen, Stirner, and Ernest Hello|last=Huneker|first=James|publisher=|year=1909|isbn=0404105254|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Kindle Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colour of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imaginatio|last=Classen|first=Constance|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0415180740|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle|last=Adams|first=Jad|publisher=Tauris Parke|year=2008|isbn=1845116844|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated in a spiritually-aware universe that maintained a cynical kind of hope, even if the poetry "requires a strong stomach."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Their work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Baudelaire: A Study|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=Eklin Matthews|year=1920|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For both of them, mortality and all manner of corruptions were always on their mind.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The ability of Rops to see and portray the same world as they did, made him a popular illustrator for other decadent authors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The concept of decadence lingered after that, but it wasn't until 1884 that Maurice Barrès referred to a particular group of writers as ''Decadents.'' He defined this group as those who had been influenced heavily by Baudelaire, though they were also influenced by [[Gothic novel]]s and the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  Many were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], others with [[Aestheticism]].&lt;ref name="Stephan1974"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRoNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165|title=Paul Verlaine and the Decadence, 1882-90|first=Philip|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1974|isbn=978-0-7190-0562-6|location=|page=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Stephan|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/symbolist/texts/decadence_chronology.html A Chronology], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weir1995"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOb26cxGBfMC&amp;pg=PA16|title=Decadence and the Making of Modernism|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87023-992-2|page=16|author=David Weir|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pursuit of these authors, according to [[Arthur Symons]], was "a desperate endeavor to give sensation, to flash the impression of the moment, to preserve the very heat and motion of life," and their achievement, as he saw it, was "to be a disembodied voice, and yet the voice of a human soul."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harpers.org/sponsor/balvenie/arthur-symons.1.html|title=The Decadent Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|date=1893|website=Harpers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1884 decadent novel ''[[À rebours|À Rebours]] (''English, ''Against Nature'' or ''Against the Grain''), [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] overthrew the past, subordinated nature to the human creative will, and suggested the primacy of, but inherent disillusion in, pleasure.  He also identified likely candidates for the core of the Decadent Movement, which he seemed to view Baudelaire as sitting above: [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Tristan Corbière]], Theodore Hannon, and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].  His character Des Esseintes hailed these writers for their creativity and their craftsmanship, suggesting that they filled him with "insidious delight" as they used a "secret language" to explore "twisted and precious ideas."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not only did ''Against Nature'' define an ideology and a literature, but it also created an influential perspective on visual art.  The character of Des Esseintes explicitly heralded the work of [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Jan Luyken]], and [[Odilon Redon]].  None of these artists would have identified themselves as part of this movement.  Nevertheless, the choice of these three established a decadent perspective on art which favored madness and irrationality, graphic violence, frank pessimism about cultural institutions, and a disregard for visual logic of the natural world.  It has also been suggested that a dream vision that Des Esseintes describes is based on the series of satanic encounters painted by Félicien Rops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valazza|first=Nicolas|year=2010|others=Edited by Amaleena Damle and Aurelie L'Hostis|title=The Flower and the Monster: On Huysmans' Painters|url=|journal=The Beautiful and the Monstrous: Essays in French Literature, Thought and Culture|series=Modern French Identities|volume=|page=96|pages=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on the momentum of Huysmans' work, Anatole Baju founded the magazine ''Le Décadent'' in 1886, an effort to define and organize the Decadent Movement in a formal way.  This group of writers did not only look to escape the boredom of the banal, but they also sought to shock, scandalize, and subvert the expectations and values of society, believing that such freedom and creative experimentation would better humanity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not everyone was comfortable with Baju and ''Le Décadent,'' even including some who had been published in its pages.  Rival writer [[Jean Moréas]] published his [[Symbolist Manifesto]], largely to escape association with the Decadent Movement, despite their shared heritage.  Moréas and [[Gustave Kahn]], among others, formed rival publications to reinforce the distinction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legitimizing the Artist: Manifesto Writing and European Modernism, 1885-1915|last=Somigli|first=Luca|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2003|isbn=1442657731|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Verlaine embraced the label at first, applauding it as a brilliant marketing choice by Baju.  After seeing his own words exploited and tiring of ''Le Décadent'' publishing works falsely attributed to [[Arthur Rimbaud]], however, Verlaine came to sour on Baju personally, and he eventually rejected the label, as well.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Decadence continued on in France, but it was limited largely to Anatole Baju and his followers, who refined their focus even further on perverse sexuality, material extravagance, and up-ending social expectations.  Far-fetched plots were acceptable if they helped generate the desired moments of salacious experience or glorification of the morbid and grotesque.  Writers who embraced the sort of decadence featured in ''Le Décadent'' include [[Albert Aurier]], [[Rachilde]], Pierre Vareilles, [[Miguel Hernández|Miguel Fernandez]], [[Jean Lorrain]], and [[Laurent Tailhade|Laurent Tailhaide]].  Many of these authors did also publish symbolist works, however, and it unclear how strongly they would have identified with Baju as decadents.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In France, the Decadent Movement is often said to have begun with either [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) or  Baudelaire's ''Les Fleur du Mal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiocleo.com/librarie/baudelaire/essay.html ''Baudelaire and the Decadent Movement''] by [[Paul Bourget]], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This movement essentially gave way to Symbolism when ''Le Décadent'' closed down in 1889 and Anatole Baju turned toward politics and became associated with anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A few writers continued the decadent tradition, such as Octave [[Octave Mirbeau|Mirbeau]], but Decadence was no longer a recognized movement, let alone a force in literature or art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought|last=Everdell|first=William R.|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1997|isbn=9780226224817|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the association of decadence with cultural decline, it is not uncommon to associate decadence in general with transitional times and their associated moods of pessimism and uncertainty.  In France, the heart of the Decadent Movement was during the 1880s and 1890s, the time of [[fin de siècle]], or end-of-the-century gloom.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As part of that overall transition, many scholars of Decadence, such as [[David Weir (academic)|David Weir]], regard Decadence as a dynamic transition between [[Romanticism]] and [[Modernism]], especially considering the decadent tendency to dehumanize and distort in the name of pleasure and fantasy.&lt;ref name="Weir1995" /&gt;

=== Distinction from Symbolism ===
[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] has often been confused with the Decadent Movement. Arthur Symons, a British poet and literary critic contemporary with the movement, at one time considered Decadence in literature to be a parent category that included both Symbolism and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]], as rebellions against realism.  He defined this common, decadent thread as, "an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity."  He referred to all such literature as, "a new and beautiful and interesting disease."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Later, however, he would go on to instead describe the Decadent Movement as an "interlude, half a mock interlude" that distracted critics from seeing and appreciating the larger and more important trend, which was the development of Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Symbolist Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=E. P. Dutton|year=1919|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is true that the two groups share an ideological descent from Baudelaire and for a time they both considered themselves as part of one sphere of new, anti-establishment literature.  They worked together and met together for quite a while, as if they were part of the same movement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Maurice Barrès referred to this group as decadents, but he also referred to one of them (Stéphane Mallarmé) as a symbolist.  Even Jean Moréas used both terms for his own group of writers as late as 1885.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Only a year later, however, [[Jean Moréas]] wrote his [[Symbolist Manifesto]] to assert a difference between the symbolists with whom he allied himself and this the new group of decadents associated with Anatole Baju and ''Le Décadent''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Even after this, there was sufficient common ground of interest, method, and language to  blur the lines more than the manifesto might have suggested.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In the world of visual arts, it can be even more difficult to distinguish decadence from symbolism.  In fact, Stephen Romer has referred to [[Félicien Rops]], [[Gustave Moreau]], and Fernand Khnopff as "Symbolist-Decadent painters and engravers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=French Decadent Tales|last=Romer|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford|year=2013|isbn=0199569274|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are clear ideological differences between those who continued on as symbolists and those who have been called "dissidents" for remaining in the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Philip|year=1972|title=Naturalist Influences on Symbolist Poetry, 1882-86.|url=|journal=The French Review|volume=46|pages=299–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, there was little doubt that Baju and his group were producing work that was decadent, but there is frequently more question about the work of the symbolists.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In a website associated with Dr. Petra Dierkes-Thrun's [[Stanford University]] course, Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents (2014), a student named Reed created a blog post that is the basis for much of what follows.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wildedecadence.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/the-differences-between-symbolism-and-decadence/|title=The Differences between Symbolism and Decadence|date=2014-03-03|website=Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Nature ====
Both groups reject the primacy of nature, but what that means for them is very different.  Symbolism uses extensive natural imagery as a means to elevate the viewer to a plane higher than the banal reality of nature itself, as when Stéphane Mallarmé mixes descriptions of flowers and heavenly imagery to create a transcendent moment in "Flowers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/54372|title=Flowers|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, in contrast, actually belittles nature in the name of artistry. In Huysmans’ ''Against Nature'', for instance, the main character Des Esseintes says of nature: “There is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing it may be, which human genius cannot create . . . There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Language and Imagery ====
Symbolism treats language and imagery as devices that can only approximate meaning and merely evoke complex emotions and call the mind toward ideas it might not be able to comprehend.  In the words of symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Languages are imperfect because multiple; the supreme language is missing... no one can utter words which would bear the miraculous stamp of Truth Herself Incarnate... how impossible it is for language to express things... in the Poet's hands... by the consistent virtue and necessity of an art which lives on fiction, it achieves its full efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|year=1956|others=Translated by Bradford Cook|title=from Crisis in Poetry|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0076/mallarme.PDF|journal=Mallarmé: Selected Prose Poems, Essays &amp; Letters|volume=|pages=|via=Scan from an un-cited anthology on Amerhert's website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Moréas would go on to assert in his manifest on symbolism, words and images serve to dress up the incomprehensible in such a way that it can be approached, if not understood.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mutablesound.com/home/?p=2165|title=Symbolist Manifesto|last=Moréas|first=Jean|date=1886|website=Mutable Sound|others=Translated by C. Liszt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, sees no path to higher truth in words and images.  Instead, books, poetry, and art itself as the creators of valid new worlds, thus the allegory of decadent Wilde's [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Dorian Gray]] being poisoned by a book like a drug.  Words and artifice are the vehicles for human creativity, and Huysmans suggests that the illusions of fantasy have their own reality: "The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Reality, Illusion, and Truth ====
Both groups are disillusioned with the meaning and truth offered by the natural world, rational thought, and ordinary society.  Symbolism turns its eyes toward Greater Purpose or on the Ideal, using dreams and symbols to approach these esoteric primal truths.  In Mallarme's poem “Apparition”, for instance, the word “dreaming” appears twice, followed by “Dream” itself with a capital D. In “The Windows,” he speaks of this decadent disgust of contentment with comfort and an endless desire for the exotic. He writes: “So filled with disgust for the man whose soul is callous, sprawled in comforts where his hungering is fed.” In this continuing search for the spiritual, therefore, Symbolism has been predisposed to concern itself with purity and beauty and such mysterious imagery as those of fairies.

In contrast, Decadence says there is no oblique approach to ultimate truth, because there is no secret, mystical truth.  They despise the very idea of searching for such a thing.  If there is truth of value, it is purely in the sensual experience of the moment.  The heroes of Decadent novels, for instance, have the unquenchable accumulation of luxuries and pleasure, often exotic, as their goal, would have space in its search for thrills for even the gory and the shocking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In [[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (book)|''The'' ''Temptation of Saint Anthony'']], decadent [[Gustave Flaubert]] describes Saint Anthony's pleasure from watching disturbing scenes of horror.  Later Czech decadent Arthur Breisky has been quoted by scholars as speaking to both the importance of illusion and of beauty: "But isn’t it necessary to believe a beautiful mask more than reality?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bugge|first=Peter|year=2006|title=Naked Masks: Arthur Breisky or How to Be a Czech Decadent|url=http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/123|journal=Word and Sense: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Theory and Criticism in Czech Studies|volume=|pages=|access-date=19 February 2017|via=Word and Sense website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Art ====
Ultimately, the distinction may best be seen in their approach to art. Symbolism is an accumulation of “symbols” that are there not to present their content but to evoke greater ideas that their symbolism cannot expressly utter.  According to Moréas, it is an attempt to connect the object and phenomena of the world to "esoteric primordial truths" that cannot ever be directly approached.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, is an accumulation of signs or descriptions acting as detailed catalogs of human material riches as well as artifice.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was Oscar Wilde who perhaps lay this out most clearly in ''[[The Decay of Lying]]'' with the suggestion of three doctrines on art, here excerpted into a list:
# "Art never expresses anything but itself."

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Collapse of the Decadent Movement ===
In France, the Decadent Movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent Movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents.  Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's ''Le Décadent'' for a time.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Others kept a foot in each camp.  Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for ''Le Décadent'' and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of ''Le Décadent''&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt; even though her own one-act drama ''The Crystal Spider'' is almost certainly a symbolist work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiebuzinska|first=Christine|year=1994|title=Behind the Mirror: Madame Rachilde's "The Crystal Spider"|url=|journal=Modern Language Studies|volume=24|pages=28–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether.  Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider ''Against Nature'' as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them.  He left decadence for anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Decadent Movement beyond France ===
While the Decadent Movement, per se, was truly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly.  Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat [[Transgressive fiction|trangressive]] spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Harvard University|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Frankel|editor-first=Nicholas|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many were also influenced by the Decadent Movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Ruth|year=2015|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Always Leave Them Wanting More: Oscar Wilde's Salmoe and the Failed Cicrulations of Desire|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|pages=21–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bohemia'''

Czech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent Movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know.  They were neither aristocrats nor bored bourgeoisie.  They were poor and hungry for something better.  The dreams of the decadents gave them that something better, but something that was hopelessly unattainable.  It was that melancholy that drove their art.  These Bohemian decadent writers included [[Karel Hlaváček]], Arnošt Procházka, [[Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic]], and Louisa Zikova.  One Czech writer, [[Arthur Breisky]], embraced the full spirit of ''Le Décadent'' with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure.  From the Decadent Movement he learned the basic idea of a [[dandy]], and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pynsent|first=Robert|year=1973|title=A Czech Dandy: An Introduction to Arthur Breisky|url=|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=51|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Britain'''
[[File:Beardsley-peacockskirt.PNG|thumb|upright|Aubrey Beardsley, ''[[The Peacock Skirt]]'', illustration for [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', 1892]]

Though influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer [[Oscar Wilde]], poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], and illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]], as well as other artists and writers associated with ''[[The Yellow Book]]''. Others, such as [[Walter Pater]], resisted association with the movement, even though their works seemed to reflect similar ideals.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Decadent Republic of Letters: Taste, Politics, and Cosmopolitan Community from Baudelaire to Beardsley|last=Potolsky|first=Matthew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2012|isbn=0812244494|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/october/rachilde-wilde-discovery-10-21-2014.html|title=Rebellious French cross-dresser played an overlooked role in shaping Oscar Wilde's legacy, Stanford scholar says|last=Beacock|first=Ian|date=21 October 2014|website=Stanford News|others=Scholarship by Petra Dierkes-Thrun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British decadents embraced the idea of creating art for its own sake, pursuing all possible desires, and seeking material excess.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  At the same time, they were not shy about using the tools of decadence for social and political purpose. Beardsley had an explicit interest in the improvement of the social order and the role of art-as-experience in inspiring that transformation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Oscar Wilde published an entire work exploring socialism as a liberating force: "Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soul of Man Under Socialism|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Arthur L. Humphreys|year=1909|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swinburne wrote explicitly addressed Irish-English politics in poetry, as when he wrote, "Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies | Clap and clamour--'Parnell spurs his Gladstone well!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swinburne|first=Algernon Charles|year=1886|title=The Commonweal: A Song for Unionists|url=|journal=A Channel Passage and Other Poems|volume=|pages=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many of their personal lives, they also pursued decadent ideals.  Wilde had a secret homosexual life.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Swinburne had an obsession with flagellation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''Russia'''

[[File:Evfimia Nosova (Ryabushinskaya) by N.Feofilaktov (1913, priv.coll).jpg|thumb|Portrait of {{ill|Euphemia Pavlova Nosova|ru|Носова, Евфимия Павловна}} by {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}]]
The Decadent Movement reached into Russia primarily through exposure to the writings of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine.  The earliest Russian adherents lacked idealism and focused on such decadent themes as subversion of morality, disregard for personal health, and living in blasphemy and sensual pleasure.  Russian writers were especially drawn to the morbid aspects of decadence and in the fascination with death.  Dmitry Merezhkovsky is thought to be the first to clearly promote a Russian decadence that included the idealism that would eventually inspire the French symbolists to disassociate from the more purely materialistic Decadent Movement.  The first Russian writers to achieve success as followers of this Decadent Movement included Konstanin Balmont, [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Valery Bryusov]], and [[Zinaida Gippius]].  As they refined their craft beyond imitation of Baudelaire and Verlaine, most of these authors became much more clearly aligned with symbolism than with decadence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bristol|first=Evelyn|year=1980|title=Idealism and Decadence in Russian Symbolist Poetry|url=|journal=Slavic Review|volume=39|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some visual artists adhered to the Baju-esque late Decadent Movement approach to sexuality as purely an act of pleasure, often ensconced in a context of material luxury.  They also shared the same emphasis on shocking society, purely for the scandal. Among them were [[Konstantin Somov]], {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}, and Nikolay Feofilaktov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowlt|first=John E.|year=1982|title=Through the Glass Darkly: Images of Decadence in Early Twentieth-Century Russian Art|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=17|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spain'''

Some art historians consider [[Francisco de Goya]] one of the roots of the Decadent movement in Spain, almost 100 years before its start in France. Their works were a cry of denouncement against injustice and oppression. However, Ramón Casas and José María López Mezquita can be considered the model artists of this period. Their paintings are an image of the social conflicts and police repression that was happening in Spain at the time.
Spaniard writers also wanted to be part of this movement. [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]] with works like [[Los Pazos de Ulloa]] where terror and decadent topics appear. [[El monstruo]] (The Monster), written by [[Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent]] belongs to Decadent Movement. But the Decadent Movement is overlapped by the [[Fin de Siglo Movement]] with the authors of the [[Generación del 98]] being part-decadent: [[Ramón María del Valle-Inclán]], [[Unamuno]] and [[Pío Baroja]] are the most essential figures of this period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Spanish Novel: From 1600 to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn= 9781139000222 |location=|pages= 138|quote=|via=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-the-spanish-novel/decadence-and-innovation-in-fin-de-siglo-spain/DBB78766FF30C8855E20D9F9A59286B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''United States'''

Few prominent writers or artists in the [[United States]] were connected with the Decadent Movement.  Those who were connected struggled to find an audience, for Americans were reluctant to see value for them in what they considered the art forms of [[fin de siècle]] France.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscapes of Decadence: Literature and Place at the Fin de Siècle|last=Murray|first=Alex|publisher=Cambridge|year=2016|isbn=1107169666|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poet [[Francis Saltus Saltus]] was inspired by Charles Baudelaire, and his unpracticed style was occasionally compared to the French poet's more refined experimentation.  He embraced the most debauched lifestyle of the French decadents and celebrated that life in his own poetry.  At the time, mostly before Baju's ''Le Décadent'', this frivolous poetry on themes of alcohol and depravity found little success and no known support from those who were part of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man in the Mirror: William Marion Reedy and His Magazine|last=Putzel|first=Max|publisher=University of Missouri|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The younger brother of Francis, writer [[Edgar Saltus]] had more success.  He had some interaction with Oscar Wilde, and he valued decadence in his personal life.  For a time, his work exemplified both the ideals and style of the movement, but a significant portion of his career was in traditional journalism and fiction that praised virtue.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decadent Culture in the United States: Art and Literature Against the American Grain, 1890 - 1926|last=Weir|first=David|publisher=State University of New York|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time when he was flourishing, however, multiple contemporary critics, as well as other decadent writers, explicitly considered him one of them.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Writer James Huneker was exposed to the Decadent Movement in France and tried to bring it back with him to New York.  He has been lauded to his dedication to this cause throughout his career, but it has also been suggested that, while he lived as a decadent and heralded their work, his own work was more frustrated, hopeless, and empty of the pleasure that had attracted him to the movement in the first place.  Largely, he focused on cynically describing the impossibility of a true American decadence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Critical studies ==
German doctor and social critic [[Max Nordau]] wrote a lengthy book entitled ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892).  It was an examination of decadence as a trend, and specifically attacked several people associated with the Decadent Movement, as well as other figures throughout the world who deviated from cultural, moral, or political norms.  His language was colorful and vitriolic, often invoking the worship of Satan.  What made the book a success was its suggestion of a medical diagnosis of "degeneration," a neuro-pathology  that resulted in these behaviors.  It also helped that the book named such figures as Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Paul Verlaine, and Maurice Barrès, members of the Decadent Movement who were in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J. A.|first=|year=1895|title=Max Nordau's Degeneration|url=|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Italian art and literature critic [[Mario Praz]] completed a broad study of morbid and erotic literature, translated and published in English as ''The Romantic Agony'' (1933).  The study included decadent writing (such as Baudelaire and Swinburne), but also anything else that he considered dark, grim, or sexual in some way.  His study centered on the 18th and 19th Centuries.  The danger of such literature, he believed it unnaturally elevated the instinctive bond between pain and pleasure and that, no matter the artists' intention, the essential role of art is to educate and teach culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mumford Jones|first=Howard|year=1936|title=Reviewed Work: The Romantic Agony. by Mario Praz, Angus Davidson|url=|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''drabble''' is a short work of fiction of one hundred words in length.&lt;ref name="WRR"&gt;[http://www.therecord.com/print/article/602546 "Winners named in WLU drabble competition"], ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'', October 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Flash fiction: 'Intense, urgent and a little explosive'", ''[[The Irish Times]]'', October 26, 2011, copy available [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-29941178.html here] from [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Womer, [https://archive.is/20130210041029/http://www.yumasun.com/news/story-75397-place-staff.html "AWC professor impressed by short story entries"], ''[[Yuma Sun]]'', December 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Flash Fiction |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/flash_fiction |encyclopedia=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |date=21 December 2011|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the drabble is brevity, testing the author's ability to express interesting and meaningful ideas in a confined space.

==History==
The concept is said to have originated in [[United Kingdom|UK]] science fiction fandom in the 1980s; the 100-word format was established by the [[Birmingham University]] SF Society, taking a term from [[Monty Python]]'s 1971 ''[[Monty Python's Big Red Book|Big Red Book]]''.&lt;ref name="WRR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; In the book, "Drabble" was described as a word game where the first participant to write a [[novel]] was the winner. In order to make the game possible in the real world, it was agreed that 100 words would suffice. 
 
In drabble contests, participants are given a [[Theme (literary)|theme]] and a certain amount of time to write.  (For example, [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] conducted a "100 Words Centennial Drabble Contest" in commemoration of its 100th anniversary in 2011, in which contestants were asked to write about "inspiration, leadership or purpose".&lt;ref name="WRR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liz Smith, [http://thecord.ca/articles/47813 "Laurier launches literary competition to commemorate Centennial year"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Cord Weekly]]'', September 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) Drabble contests, and drabbles in general, are popular in [[science fiction fandom]] and in [[fan fiction]].  Beccon Publications published three volumes, ''The Drabble Project'' (1988) and ''Drabble II: Double Century'' (1990), both edited by Rob Meades and David Wake, and ''Drabble Who'' (1993), edited by [[David J. Howe]] and David Wake.

==Examples==
Published science fiction writers who have written drabbles include [[Brian Aldiss]] and [[Gene Wolfe]] (both of whom contributed to ''The Drabble Project''),&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; [[Lois McMaster Bujold]] (whose novel ''[[Cryoburn]]'' finishes with a sequence of five drabbles, each told from the point of view of a different character),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/09/review_cryoburn_a_miles_vorkosigan_novel_by_lois_mcmaster_bujold/ |title=REVIEW: ‘Cryoburn (A Miles Vorkosigan Novel)’ by Lois McMaster Bujold |author=T K Kenyon |date=22 September  2011 |publisher=SF Signal |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science fiction books |author=Fred Cleaver |url=http://www.denverpost.com/rss/ci_16651750 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jake Bible]] (whose novel ''Dead Mech'' was written entirely in drabble format).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jakebible.com/whats-a-drabble/|title=What’s A Drabble?|date=2010-01-10|work=Jake Bible Fiction|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''100 Word Story'' is an online literary journal that was co-founded in 2011 by [[Grant Faulkner]] and Lynn Mundell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/interviews/flash-fiction|title=Flash! Fiction!  - The Review Review|website=www.thereviewreview.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes stories that are exactly 100 words long.

The web has also enabled a rapid spread of the genre, with publishers such as [[The Third Word Press]] using the web to collect drabble stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.third-word.com/|title=The Third Word Press |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==55 Fiction==
One example of drabble is 55 Fiction, which is a form of [[microfiction]] that refers to the works of fiction that are either limited to a maximum of 55 words or have a requirement of exactly 55 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ron Wiggins|title=PAPER CHALLENGES WRITERS TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF3F22AEE950D98&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Palm Beach Post|date=October 11, 2001}} {{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of ''55 Fiction'' can be traced to a short story writing contest organized by ''New Times'', an independent alternative weekly in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], in 1987.&lt;ref name=fff&gt;{{cite news|title=Mini- és maxiregények|url=http://www.nyest.hu/hirek/mini-es-maxiregenyek|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Nyelv és Tudomány|date=June 27, 2011|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was proposed by ''New Times'' founder and publisher [[Steve Moss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NEW TIMES PUBLISHER DIED OF EPILEPSY|newspaper=The Tribune|date=May 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria===
A literary work will be considered ''55 Fiction''{{cn|date=November 2015}} if it has:
# 55 words or fewer, however some publishers actually require exactly 55 words – no more and no less;
# A setting;
# One or more characters;
# Some conflict; and
# A resolution. (''Not limited to the moral of the story'')
The title of the story is not part of the overall word count, but cannot exceed seven words.

'''Fire art''' is a piece of art that uses active [[Fire|flames]] as an essential part of the piece. The piece may either use flame effects as part of a sculpture, or be a choreographed performance of fire effects as the piece burns; the latter being almost a type of [[performance art]]. 

Fire can be a compelling medium for artists and viewers. It has a direct effect on its surroundings, consuming materials and giving heat and light. It is constantly moving and can appear to be alive. There is also the inherent perceived danger of fire.

Fire artists use various [[fuel]]s and colorants to achieve desired effects. The choice of fuel is largely dependent on the effects desired. In large stationary pieces, [[propane]] gas is a popular fuel. Gas escaping from its container can be set alight. Different plumbing, pressures, nozzles alter the nature of the flames. Controlling how the propane mixes with the oxygen in the air is important. 

Liquid fuels like [[alcohol]], [[methanol]], [[kerosene]], mixes of kerosene and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], and others, can produce spectacular results. Extra precautions must be taken with liquids because they fall and splash, while gasses usually dissipate. 

Most colorants are solids ground into a powder. As the powder is heated, it begins to [[oxidize]] and burns a color particular to the chemical used. Some colorants can be dissolved in alcohol or water or other liquids to facilitate their dispersion in the fire. Some colorants are toxic and should not be used in proximity to people.

'''Funk art''' is an American [[art movement]] that was a reaction against the nonobjectivity of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; An [[anti-establishment]] movement, Funk art brought [[figurative art|figuration]] back as subject matter in [[painting]] again rather than limiting itself to the non-figurative, abstract forms that abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]] were depicting. The movement’s name was derived from the [[jazz]] musical term "[[funk]]y", describing the passionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The term [[funk]] also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in California's [[Bay Area]] in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a [[collective]] art style or group.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"&gt;Karlstrom, Paul J. ''Peter Selz: Sketches of a Life in Art''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because while its artists shared the same attitudes and created similar works, they were not necessarily working together.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt;

==History==

===Bay Area===
The Funk art movement was a regional art movement, most predominant in [[Northern California]]. Some notable cities where the Funk movement was concentrated in consisted of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Marin County]], [[Big Sur]], and [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many Funk artists began as [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] painters in the 1950s. The movement originated from the bohemian underground in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"&gt;Engelbach, Barbara ''Looking for Mushrooms: Beat Poets, Hippies, Funk, Minimal Art San Francisco 1955-68''. Köln König: Museum Ludwig, Köln, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the Bay Area, specifically [[San Francisco]], was a free and spiritual environment due to its [[beatnik]] art culture and the youth political activism reacting against the [[Vietnam War]] going on at the time.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"/&gt; A variety of different cultures existed in the city, including poetry, jazz, and art. The freedom of thinking and culture was one of the main reasons that Funk art, a combination of both painting and sculpture, could develop and prosper in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

The Funk art that occurred throughout Northern California was the exact opposite of the "Fetish Finish" sculptures made in [[Southern California]] and the "primary structures" constructed in New York at the time.&lt;ref name="Selz"&gt;Selz, Peter. ''Funk''. Berkeley: The Regents of the University of California, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Funk art in the Bay Area was unique and not similar to any other movement of the 1960s.  [[Jess Collins|Jess]], [[Wally Hedrick]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Viola Frey]], [[Wallace Berman]] and [[Bruce Conner]] were notable Funk artists who emerged from the Bay Area. Jess was one of the earliest and most influential Funk artists.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; In 1967, [[Peter Selz]], the first director of the University of Art Museum in Berkeley, California, organized a Funk Show there. Selz wanted to showcase the strange mindset in California through an array of Funk pieces.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; The exhibition featured works from [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Mowry Baden]] and [[Bruce Conner]], and it brought national recognition to the movement for the first time.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;Albright, Thomas. ''[[Art in the San Francisco Bay Area (book)|Art in the San Francisco Bay Area 1945-1980]]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0520051939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this show, not many people outside of the Bay Area had seen or heard of Funk works, which relieved artists of pressures to become successful.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

==Characteristics and techniques==
The characteristics and techniques of Funk art works were more important than the subject matter.

===Self-identification===
Unlike earlier movements, such as [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], Funk art was not concerned with public [[morality]]. Its artists were committed to identifying with their works on a personal level instead of the social or existential. Through their absurdist works, Funk artists demonstrated personal feelings, emotions and processes and in this way their work had a closer [[nature v culture|relationship to nature rather than to culture]]. The works had creative freedom and demonstrated the artists' lives, personalities and experiences.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Funk artists treated their work with a sense of humor, senselessness, confrontation, vulgar sexuality and [[autobiographical]] references.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; In their pieces, Funk artists are sometimes self-deprecating and [[ironic]].  Although the works are humorous, they sometimes cover a more serious undertone.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Since there was no clear meaning in many pieces, Funk art contains a sense of ambiguity.

===Found objects===
Funk art was inspired by [[popular culture]], contains attitude and uses an unlikely mixture of materials and techniques. One of the movement's main characteristics is that it incorporates found objects from [[Consumerism|consumer culture]]. It was a part of the larger movement called [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]], which also included paintings that were composed of three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; [[Bruce Conner]] was known for his assemblage works, including ''Arachne'', ''Spider Lady'', ''For Marilyn'', ''Cosmic Death Song'', and ''Tick Tock Jelly Clock Cosmotron''.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many of the Funk [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] pieces were composed of thrown out garbage to demonstrate that Funk art was not a part of consumer culture.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; The pieces are usually three dimensional, but they resemble paintings more than sculptures.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; [[Jess Collins|Jess]] and [[Wally Hedrick]] were two of the first Funk artists to use found objects in their works.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The objects used tended to be items that were not meant to be noticed.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; The idea of using ordinary subject matter and common objects in art was influenced by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; This concept is also influenced by the pieces of the [[Dada]] movement because both art movements use everyday objects and have a sense of freedom.The objects and debris used in works symbolized decay many of the time.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Due to the artists lack of concern with impeccable technique, durability or form, the works each possessed a somewhat sloppy finish.

==Ceramics==
Non-functional ceramic art was an important element in the Funk art movement, especially in Regina{{Where|date=June 2015}} and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Funk art ceramics were primarily composed from clay and possessed themes that were thought of as inappropriate by artists belonging to other movements.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;  Similar to its three dimensional paintings, Funk ceramics contained vulgar male humor, as well as sexual references.&lt;ref name="Shields"&gt;Shields, Scott A. "California Funk." ''Ceramics Monthly 56.9'' (2008): 38-41. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Funk works, the ceramics also used funny and absurd styles and images to relay the message that people should not take art or themselves too seriously. The ceramics were unrefined and blatant, and they all possessed the idea of a functionless sculpture for sculptures sake.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;

===Robert Arneson===
[[Robert Arneson]] started the ceramic art movement within Funk art in the Bay Area.  Before him, ceramics were considered more of a craft rather than a prestigious art form.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; After him, ceramics caught on as a serious form of art nationally.{{cn|date=June 2015}} [[Robert Arneson]] created many ceramic sculptures, which eventually became a common work of Funk artists. Some believe his ceramics were influenced by [[pop art]] sculptures because they were of mundane, everyday objects. A main difference was that [[Robert Arneson]] also included personal elements to his sculptures, which was a defining factor of Funk art.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; His works were playful and full of color.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;
[[Robert Arneson]], along with other Funk artists, such as [[Roy De Forest]], [[Manuel Neri]], and [[William T. Wiley]] taught at the [[University of California, Davis]], which was a center for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art, Interview with Bruce Nauman http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/nauman80.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Students from [[University of California, Davis]], such as Margaret Dodd, [[David Gilhooly]], [[Victor Cicansky]], Chris Unterseher, and Peter Vandenberge, continued Arneson's ceramics tradition.

In 1967, [[Robert Arneson]] drafted ceramicist [[Clayton Bailey]] to cover his classes at [[University of California, Davis]] while he took a [[sabbatical]].&lt;ref name=WOW&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

==Exhibitions==

Founded in [[Folsom, California]], in 1962, the [[Candy Store Gallery]] played a key role in promoting Funk art by means of regular exhibitions until its closure in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Intellectual property''' ('''IP''') is a category of [[property]] that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, and primarily encompasses [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, and [[trademark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes other types of rights, such as [[trade secret]]s, [[publicity rights]], [[moral rights]], and rights against [[unfair competition]]. Artistic works like music and literature, as well as some discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs, can all be protected as intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/intel1_e.htm |title=What are intellectual property rights? |website=World Trade Organization |publisher=World Trade Organization |access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Intellectual property", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 10th ed. (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the 19th century that the term "intellectual property" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world.&lt;ref name="Lemley 2005"&gt;"property as a common descriptor of the field probably traces to the foundation of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by the United Nations." in [[Mark A. Lemley]], [http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf ''Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226035349/http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf |date=2009-02-26 }}, Texas Law Review, 2005, Vol. 83:1031, page 1033, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a large variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create{{snd}}usually for a limited period of time.  This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}} These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.&lt;ref&gt;Rod Falvey and Neil Foster (2006): “The Role of Intellectual Property Rights in Technology Transfer and Economic Growth”: Theory and Evidence, In cooperation with Olga Memedovic UNITED NATIONS INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION (UNIDO),  available: https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2009-04/Role_of_intellectual_property_rights_in_technology_transfer_and_economic_growth_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is "indivisible" – an unlimited number of people can "consume" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18–19}}

==History==
{{Main|History of copyright law|History of patent law}}
[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|The [[Statute of Anne]] came into force in 1710]]

The [[Statute of Monopolies]] (1624) and the British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) are seen as the origins of [[patent law]] and [[copyright]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brad |first=Sherman |author2=Lionel Bently |title=The making of modern intellectual property law: the British experience, 1760–1911 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |page=207 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=u2aMRA-eF1gC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-521-56363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property.

The first known use of the term ''intellectual property'' dates to 1769, when a piece published in the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'' used the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | intellectual property }} (Citing ''Monthly Review'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=cMsvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false vol. 41. p. 290] (1769): "What a niggard this Doctor is of his own, and how profuse he is of other people's intellectual property.")&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear example of modern usage goes back as early as 1808, when it was used as a heading title in a collection of essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | intellectual property }} (Citing ''Medical Repository Of Original Essays And Intelligence'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij9JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA303 vol. 11. p. 303] (1808): "New-England Association in favour of Inventors and Discoverers, and particularly for the Protection of intellectual Property.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The German equivalent was used with the founding of the [[North German Confederation]] whose [[constitution]] granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property (''Schutz des geistigen Eigentums'') to the confederation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de67-18/verfassung67-i.htm 'Article 4 No. 6 of the Constitution of 1867 (German)'] Hastings Law Journal, Vol. 52, p. 1255, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When the administrative secretariats established by the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] (1883) and the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] (1886) merged in 1893, they located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title, the [[United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property]].

The organization subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by [[Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization|treaty]] as an agency of the [[United Nations]]. According to legal scholar [[Mark Lemley]], it was only at this point that the term really began to be used in the United States (which had not been a party to the Berne Convention),&lt;ref name="Lemley 2005" /&gt; and it did not enter popular usage there until passage of the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Lemley, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=582602 "Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding"] (Abstract); see Table 1: 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The history of patents does not begin with inventions, but rather with royal grants by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603) for monopoly privileges... Approximately 200 years after the end of Elizabeth's reign, however, a patent represents a legal [[right]] obtained by an inventor providing for exclusive control over the production and sale of his mechanical or scientific invention... [demonstrating] the evolution of patents from royal prerogative to common-law doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;Mossoff, A. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=863925 'Rethinking the Development of Patents: An Intellectual History, 1550–1800,'] Hastings Law Journal, Vol. 52, p. 1255, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term can be found used in an October 1845 [[Massachusetts Circuit Court]] ruling in the patent case ''Davoll et al. v. Brown.'', in which Justice Charles L. Woodbury wrote that "only in this way can we protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests are as much a man's own...as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears."&lt;ref&gt;''1 Woodb. &amp; M. 53, 3 West.L.J. 151, 7 F.Cas. 197, No. 3662, 2 Robb.Pat.Cas. 303, Merw.Pat.Inv. 414''&lt;/ref&gt; The statement that "discoveries are..property" goes back earlier. Section 1 of the [[French law of 1791]] stated, "All new discoveries are the property of the author; to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery, there shall be delivered to him a patent for five, ten or fifteen years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |title=Patent Archives – Ladas &amp; Parry LLP |publisher=Ladas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115040700/http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, [[France|French]] author A. Nion mentioned ''propriété intellectuelle'' in his ''Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs'', published in 1846.

Until recently, the purpose of intellectual property law was to give as little protection as possible in order to encourage innovation. Historically, therefore, they were granted only when they were necessary to encourage invention, limited in time and scope.&lt;ref name="Mark A. Lemley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tlr83&amp;div=30&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals |title=Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding |author=Mark A. Lemley |publisher=Heinonline.org |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly as a result of knowledge being traditionally viewed as a public good, in order to allow its extensive dissemination and improvement thereof.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist; (October 20th 2005): “The Liquidity of Innovation”; How the new market for intellectual property is changing the technology industry, available; https://www.economist.com/node/5015365&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept's origins can potentially be traced back further. [[Jewish law]] includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws, though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of Hasagat Ge'vul (unfair encroachment) was used to justify limited-term publisher (but not author) copyright in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/copyright1.html |title=Jewish Law – Articles ("Jewish Law and Copyright") |publisher=Jlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of [[Sybaris]] offered one year's patent "to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Anthon, A Classical Dictionary: Containing an Account of the Principal Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors, and Intended to Elucidate All the Important Points Connected with the Geography, History, Biography, Mythology, and Fine Arts of the Greek and Romans.

According to Jean-Frédéric Morin, "the global intellectual property regime is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, up until the early 2000s the global IP regime used to be dominated by high standards of protection characteristic of IP laws from Europe or the United States, with a vision that uniform application of these standards over every country and to several fields with little consideration over social, cultural or environmental values or of the national level of economic development. Morin argues that "the emerging discourse of the global IP regime advocates for greater policy flexibility and greater access to knowledge, especially for developing countries." Indeed, with the Development Agenda adopted by WIPO in 2007, a set of 45 recommendations to adjust WIPO’s activities to the specific needs of developing countries and aim to reduce distortions especially on issues such as patients’ access to medicines, Internet users’ access to information, farmers’ access to seeds, programmers’ access to source codes or students’ access to scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this paradigm shift has not yet manifested itself in concrete legal reforms at the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it is based on these background that the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement requires members of the WTO to set minimum standards of legal protection, but its objective to have a “one-fits-all” protection law on Intellectual Property has been viewed with controversies regarding differences in the development level of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roisah|first=Kholis|date=2017-12-26|title=Understanding Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement: From Hard and Soft Law Perspective|url=http://pasca.unhas.ac.id/ojs/index.php/halrev/article/view/1153|journal=Hasanuddin Law Review|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277–289|doi=10.20956/halrev.v3i3.1153|issn=2442-9899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy, the agreement has extensively incorporated intellectual property rights into the global trading system for the first time in 1995, and has prevailed as the most comprehensive agreement reached by the world.&lt;ref&gt;WTO (2013): Intellectual Property; Responding to least developed countries’ special needs in intellectual property; https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/ldc_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property rights==
Intellectual property rights include [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], [[industrial design right]]s, [[trademark]]s, [[plant variety rights]], [[trade dress]], [[geographical indications]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=288514 Article 1(2) of the Paris Convention]: "The protection of industrial property has as its object patents, utility models, industrial designs, trademarks, service marks, trade names, indications of source or appellations of origin, and the repression of unfair competition."&lt;/ref&gt; and in some jurisdictions [[trade secret]]s. There are also more specialized or derived varieties of ''[[sui generis]]'' exclusive rights, such as circuit design rights (called [[mask work]] rights in the US) and [[supplementary protection certificate]]s for pharmaceutical products (after expiry of a patent protecting them) and [[database rights]] (in [[EC law|European law]]). The term "industrial property" is sometimes used to refer to a large subset of intellectual property rights including patents, trademarks, industrial designs, utility models, service marks, trade names, and geographical indications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/index.html|title=Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents===
{{Main|Patent}}
A [[patent]] is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor or their successor-in-title, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing an [[invention]] for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfill three main requirements: it has to be new, not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability.&lt;ref name="WIPO Handbook Ch 2"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch2.pdf WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook: Policy, Law and Use.

===Copyright===
{{Main|Copyright}}
A [[copyright]] gives the creator of an original work [[exclusive right]]s to it, usually for a limited time. Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works".&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights] |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |format=PDF |author=World Intellectual Property Organisation |title=Understanding Copyright and Related Rights |publisher=WIPO |accessdate=August 2008 |page=8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66HD0x4jV?url=http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/909/wipo_pub_909.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;dq=idea-expression+dichotomy&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Art and copyright] |pages=48–49 |author=Simon, Stokes |isbn=978-1-84113-225-9 |year=2001 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial design rights===
{{Main|Industrial design right}}
An [[industrial design right]] (sometimes called "design right" or ''design patent'') protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Generally speaking, it is what makes a product look appealing, and as such, it increases the commercial value of goods.&lt;ref name="wipo.int"/&gt;

===Plant varieties===
{{Main|Plant breeders' rights}}
[[Plant breeders' rights]] or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant. The variety must amongst others be novel and distinct and for registration the evaluation of propagating material of the variety is considered.

===Trademarks===
{{Main|Trademark}}
A [[trademark]] is a recognizable [[sign (semiotics)|sign]], [[design]] or [[expression (language)|expression]] which distinguishes [[Good (economics)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] of a particular trader from the similar products or services of other traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/definitions.jsp |title=Trademark, Patent, or Copyright? |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-whatis.htm |title=A trade mark is a sign which can distinguish your goods and services from those of your competitors (you may refer to your trade mark as your "brand"). |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patentamt.de/english/trade_marks/index.html |title=Trade marks identify the goods and services of particular traders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade dress===
{{Main|Trade dress}}
[[Trade dress]] is a legal term of art that generally refers to characteristics of the visual and aesthetic appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert P. |last=Merges |first2=Peter S. |last2=Menell |first3=Mark A. |last3=Lemley |title=Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age |edition=4th rev. |year=2007 |location=New York |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |isbn=978-0-7355-6989-8 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade secrets===
{{Main|Trade secret}}
A [[trade secret]] is a [[formula]], practice, process, [[design]], instrument, [[pattern]], or compilation of [[information]] which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a [[business]] can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers. There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g., Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)

==Object of intellectual property law==
The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods for consumers.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time.  Because they can then profit from them, this gives economic incentive for their creation.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is indivisible – an unlimited number of people can "consume" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – while a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of information and intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent their wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18–19}}

By exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be "absolute protection". "If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions".&lt;ref name="Mark A. Lemley" /&gt; This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of "real" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the [[Leahy-Smith America Invents Act|America Invents Act]], stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of [[commodification]] derived from this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farah |first1=Paolo Davide |last2=Tremolada |first2=Riccardo |title=Desirability of Commodification of Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Unsatisfying Role of Intellectual Property Rights |journal=Transnational Dispute Management |date=March 15, 2014 |volume=11 |issue=2 |ssrn=2472339 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.

===Financial incentive===
These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated [[research and development]] costs.&lt;ref name="MonoProf"&gt;[http://www.uclan.ac.uk/schools/school_of_health/research_projects/files/health_innova_IPR_reform_report.pdf Prudential Reasons for IPR Reform], University of Melbourne, Doris Schroeder and Peter Singer, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States Article I Section 8 Clause 8 of the Constitution, commonly called the Patent and Copyright Clause, reads; "[The Congress shall have power] 'To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright &amp; Fair Use|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/law/us-constitution/|website=Stanford University Libraries|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ”Some commentators, such as [[David K. Levine|David Levine]] and [[Michele Boldrin]], dispute this justification.&lt;ref name='R000000'&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=David |authorlink=David K. Levine |author2=Michele Boldrin |author2link=Michele Boldrin |title=Against intellectual monopoly |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2008-09-07 |location= |url=http://www.dklevine.com/papers/imbookfinalall.pdf |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-521-87928-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office approximated that the worth of intellectual property to the U.S. economy is more than US $5 trillion and creates employment for an estimated 18 million American people. The value of intellectual property is considered similarly high in other developed nations, such as those in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Chemotherapy That Costs $70,000 in the U.S. Costs $2,500 in India |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/why-chemotherapy-that-costs-70-000-in-the-us-costs-2-500-in-india/274847/ |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |accessdate=18 April 2013 |author=Thomas Bollyky |date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, IP has become a recognised asset class for use in [[Pension led funding|pension-led funding]] and other types of business finance. However, in 2013, the UK Intellectual Property Office stated: "There are millions of intangible business assets whose value is either not being leveraged at all, or only being leveraged inadvertently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brassell, King |first=Martin, Kelvin |title=Banking on IP? |year=2013 |publisher=The Intellectual Property Office |location=Newport, Wales |isbn=978-1-908908-86-5 |page=15 |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresearch-bankingip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The WIPO treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth. The ''WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook'' gives two reasons for intellectual property laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations and the rights of the public in access to those creations. The second is to promote, as a deliberate act of Government policy, creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch1.pdf p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA) states that "effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/acta-crc_apr15-2011_eng.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507132516/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/acta-crc_apr15-2011_eng.pdf|date=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists estimate that two-thirds of the value of large businesses in the United States can be traced to intangible assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonecon.com/docs/studies/0807_thevalueofip.pdf |format=PDF |title=Economic Effects of Intellectual Property-Intensive Manufacturing in the United States |author1=Robert J.

Pham |publisher=Sonecon.com |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "IP-intensive industries" are estimated to generate 72 percent more [[value added]] (price minus material cost) per employee than "non-IP-intensive industries".&lt;ref name="Shapiro-Pham"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216195041/http://www.the-value-of-ip.org/ Economic Effects of Intellectual Property-Intensive Manufacturing in the United States], Robert Shapiro and Nam Pham, July 2007 (archived on archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=July 2009}}&lt;!--does advertising count as "value"--&gt;

===Morality===
According to Article 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], "everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the relationship between intellectual property and [[human rights]] is a complex one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WIPO – The World Intellectual Property Organization |title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: An Overview |url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022125749/http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are moral arguments for intellectual property.

The arguments that justify intellectual property fall into three major categories. Personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual. Utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation. Lockeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/#LocJusIntPro|title=Intellectual Property|last=Moore|first=Adam|date=2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property, such as:

# ''Natural Rights/Justice Argument'': this argument is based on Locke's idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and/or products which is produced by his/her body. Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald V. Bettig. "Critical Perspectives on the History and Philosophy of Copyright" in Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property, by Ronald V. Bettig. (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1996), 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to apply his argument to intellectual property rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create. They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.
# ''Utilitarian-Pragmatic Argument'': according to this rationale, a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not. Innovation and invention in 19th century America has been attributed to the development of the [[patent]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 416.&lt;/ref&gt; By providing innovators with "durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources", intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility.&lt;ref name="Spinello 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spinello |first=Richard A. |title=Intellectual property rights |journal=Library Hi Tech |date=January 2007 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=12–22 |doi=10.1108/07378830710735821}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 3, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption is that they promote public welfare by encouraging the "creation, production, and distribution of intellectual works".&lt;ref name="Spinello 2007" /&gt; Utilitarians argue that without intellectual property there would be a lack of incentive to produce new ideas. Systems of protection such as Intellectual property optimize social utility.
# ''"Personality" Argument'': this argument is based on a quote from [[Hegel]]: "Every man has the right to turn his will upon a thing or make the thing an object of his will, that is to say, to set aside the mere thing and recreate it as his own".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; European intellectual property law is shaped by this notion that ideas are an "extension of oneself and of one's personality".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Personality theorists argue that by being a creator of something one is inherently at risk and vulnerable for having their ideas and designs stolen and/or altered. Intellectual property protects these moral claims that have to do with personality.

[[Lysander Spooner]] (1855) argues "that a man has a natural and absolute right—and if a natural and absolute, then necessarily a perpetual, right—of property, in the ideas, of which he is the discoverer or creator; that his right of property, in ideas, is intrinsically the same as, and stands on identically the same grounds with, his right of property in material things; that no distinction, of principle, exists between the two cases".&lt;ref&gt;The Law of Intellectual Property, Part 1 Chapter 1 Section 9 – Lysander Spooner&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Ayn Rand]] argued in her book ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'' that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue. The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property. To violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal |location=New York |publisher=Signet |year=1967 |origyear=1966 |edition=paperback 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infringement, misappropriation, and enforcement==
{{Main|Intellectual property infringement}}

Violation of intellectual property rights, called "infringement" with respect to patents, copyright, and trademarks, and "misappropriation" with respect to trade secrets, may be a breach of civil law or criminal law, depending on the type of intellectual property involved, jurisdiction, and the nature of the action.

As of 2011 trade in counterfeit copyrighted and trademarked works was a $600 billion industry worldwide and accounted for 5–7% of global trade.&lt;ref name=Bitton&gt;Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement's Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 102(1):67-117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent infringement===
{{Main|Patent infringement|}}

Patent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined in the [[claim (patent)|claims]] of the granted patent. There is [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug.&lt;ref&gt;Pradip K. Sahu and Shannon Mrksich, Ph.D. [http://www.brinkshofer.com/resource_center/85-the-hatch-waxman-act-research-exempt-from-patent-infringement The Hatch-Waxman Act: When Is Research Exempt from Patent Infringement?] ABA-IPL Newsletter 22(4) Summer 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L.

===Copyright infringement===
{{Main|Copyright infringement}}

Copyright infringement is reproducing, distributing, displaying or performing a [[Copyright law#Scope|work]], or to make [[derivative work]]s, without permission from the copyright holder, which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the work's creator. It is often called "piracy".&lt;ref name=Panethiere_p2&gt;{{cite web |last=Panethiere |first=Darrell |title=The Persistence of Piracy: The Consequences for Creativity, for Culture, and for Sustainable Development |publisher=UNESCO e-Copyright Bulletin |date=July–September 2005 |page=2 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080816063513/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While copyright is created the instant a work is fixed, generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyright.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Enforcement of copyright is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder.&lt;ref name=Xuan_p211&gt;{{cite book |last=Correa |first=Carlos Maria |author2=Li, Xuan |title=Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2009 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&amp;dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta |isbn=978-1-84844-663-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, and which has not entered into force, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to active police for infringement.&lt;ref name=Bitton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musa&gt;Irina D.

Examples of such doctrines are the [[fair use]] and [[fair dealing]] doctrine.

===Trademark infringement===
{{Main|Trademark infringement}}

Trademark infringement occurs when one party uses a trademark that is identical or [[confusing similarity|confusingly similar]] to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services of the other party. In many countries, a trademark receives protection without registration, but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement. Infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and, in several jurisdictions, under criminal law.&lt;ref name=Bitton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musa /&gt;

===Trade secret misappropriation===
{{Main|Trade secret#Misappropriation}}

Trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]]. The United States also has federal law in the form of the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, {{uscsub|18|1831|a}}, criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, {{usc|18|1832}}, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===The term "intellectual property"===
Criticism of the term ''intellectual property'' ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like ''property'' and ''rights'' in fashions that contradict practice and law. Many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright, patents, trademarks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mike Masnick |authorlink1=Mike Masnick |title=If Intellectual Property Is Neither Intellectual, Nor Property, What Is It? |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml |website=techdirt.com |publisher=[[Techdirt]] |accessdate=17 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813003301/https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml |archivedate=13 August 2014 |date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free Software Foundation]] founder [[Richard Stallman]] argues that, although the term ''intellectual property'' is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it "systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion". He claims that the term "operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues" and that it creates a "bias" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to "property rights".&lt;ref name="mirage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml |title=Did You Say "Intellectual Property"? It's a Seductive Mirage |author=Richard M. Stallman |accessdate=2008-03-28 |publisher=Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. He argues that "to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion, it is best to adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of 'intellectual property'."&lt;ref name="words-to-avoid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#IntellectualProperty |title=Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing |author=Richard M. Stallman |accessdate=2016-12-01 |publisher=The GNU Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, economists [[Michele Boldrin|Boldrin]] and [[David K. Levine|Levine]] prefer to use the term "intellectual monopoly" as a more appropriate and clear definition of the concept, which they argue, is very dissimilar from property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Boldrin, Michele, and David K. Levine. [http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/against.htm Against intellectual monopoly]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They further argued that “stronger patents do little or nothing to encourage innovation”, mainly explained by its tendency to create market monopolies, thereby restricting further innovations and technology transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine (2009): “Intellectual Property Rights and Economic Growth in the Long-Run”; A model Discovery, available; http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/aea_pp09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights, Stallman says that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws, which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system, and later on, a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally, but never interfered with the freedom of average readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/copyright.html |title=copyright and globalization in the age of computer networks |date=19 April 2001 |accessdate=21 October 2015 |website=mit.edu |publisher= |author=Richard Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302072256/http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/copyright.html |archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still referring to copyright, he cites legal literature such as the United States Constitution and [[case law]] to demonstrate that the law is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain to temporarily trade property rights and free speech for public, not private, benefits in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge. He mentions that "if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html |title=Misinterpreting Copyright |date= |accessdate=21 October 2015 |website=gnu.org |publisher= |author=Richard Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905075652/https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html |archivedate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor, writer and political activist [[Lawrence Lessig]], along with many other [[copyleft]] and free software activists, has criticized the implied analogy with physical property (like land or an automobile). They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original).&lt;ref name="lessigperpetual" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Intellectual property" is a silly euphemism |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/intellectual.property |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property, there is [[artificial scarcity|no natural scarcity]] of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original. [[Stephan Kinsella]] has objected to ''intellectual property'' on the grounds that the word "property" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella (2001) [https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/15_2/15_2_1.pdf Against Intellectual Property] Journal of Libertarian Studies 15(2):1–53&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative terms====
In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, intellectual property has often been referred to as [[intellectual rights]], traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold. Use of the term ''intellectual rights'' has declined since the early 1980s, as use of the term ''intellectual property'' has increased.

Alternative terms ''monopolies on information'' and ''intellectual monopoly'' have emerged among those who argue against the "property" or "intellect" or "rights" assumptions, notably [[Richard Stallman]]. The [[backronym]]s ''intellectual protectionism'' and ''intellectual poverty'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella for Ludwig von Mises Institute blog, January 6, 2011. [http://archive.mises.org/15240/intellectual-poverty/ Intellectual Poverty]&lt;/ref&gt; whose initials are also ''IP'', have found supporters as well, especially among those who have used the backronym ''[[Opposition to digital rights management|digital restrictions management]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drm.info/ Official drm.info site] run by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management |title=What is DRM? |publisher=Defective by Design |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that an intellectual property right should (in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests) be termed an ''intellectual monopoly privilege'' (IMP) has been advanced by several academics including Birgitte Andersen&lt;ref&gt;Birgitte Andersen.

More recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that [[patent thickets]] are undermining technological development even in high-tech fields like [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/11/stallmans-got-company-researcher-wants-nanotech-patent-moratorium/ Stallman's got company: Researcher wants nanotech patent moratorium] – Ars Technica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/23/professor-seeks-nanotech-patent-moratorium Freeze on nanotechnology patents proposed to help grow the sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302113908/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/23/professor-seeks-nanotech-patent-moratorium |date=2014-03-02 }}- Wired UK 11-23-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Petra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Overall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation. On the contrary, policies that encourage the diffusion of ideas and modify patent laws to facilitate entry and encourage competition may be an effective mechanism to encourage innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Petra. 2013. "Patents and Innovation: Evidence from Economic History." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 27(1): 23-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In support of that argument, [[Jörg Baten]], Nicola Bianchi and Petra Moser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baten|first1=Jörg|last2=Bianchi|first2=Nicola|last3=Moser|first3=Petra|title=Compulsory licensing and innovation–Historical evidence from German patents after WWI|journal=Journal of Development Economics|date=2017|volume=126|pages=231–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; find historical evidence that especially compulsory licensing – which allows governments to license patents without the consent of patent-owners – encouraged invention in Germany in the early 20th century by increasing the threat of competition in fields with low pre-existing levels of competition.

[[Peter Drahos]] notes, "Property rights confer authority over resources. When authority is granted to the few over resources on which many depend, the few gain power over the goals of the many. This has consequences for both political and economic freedoms with in a society."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite.

The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WIPO – World Intellectual Property Organization |title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: An Overview |url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022125749/http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] issued a document called "Human rights and intellectual property" that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws.

Further along these lines, The ethical problems brought up by IP rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines are given IP protection. While the application of IP rights can allow companies to charge higher than the marginal cost of production in order to recoup the costs of research and development, the price may exclude from the market anyone who cannot afford the cost of the product, in this case a life-saving drug.&lt;ref name=Sonderholm&gt;Jorn Sonderholm (2010) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00358.x/abstract Ethical Issues Surrounding Intellectual Property Rights], Philosophy Compass 5(12): 1107–1115.&lt;/ref&gt; "An IPR driven regime is therefore not a regime that is conductive to the investment of R&amp;D of products that are socially valuable to predominately poor populations".&lt;ref name=Sonderholm /&gt;{{rp|1108–9}}

[[Libertarian]]s have [[Libertarian perspectives on intellectual property|differing views on intellectual property]].{{Fact|date=August 2018}} [[Stephan Kinsella]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] on the [[right-libertarian|right-wing of libertarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella, [http://web.archive.org/web/20180415041048/https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/01/stephan-kinsella/what-it-means-to-be-an-anarcho-capitalist/ "What It Means To Be an Anarcho-Capitalist"], "LewRockwell.com", published 2004-01-20, archived 2018-04-15, accessed 2018-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; [[criticism of intellectual property|argues against intellectual property]] because allowing property rights in ideas and information creates [[artificial scarcity]] and infringes on the right to own tangible property. Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy&amp;mdash;let's call him Galt-Magnon&amp;mdash;decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/books/against.pdf N. Stephan Kinsella, ''Against Intellectual property''] (2008), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] once said in a letter to Isaac McPherson on August 13, 1813:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his [[candle|taper]] at mine, receives light without darkening me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Thomas Jefferson, ''Letter to Isaac McPherson''] (August 13, 1813)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005 the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|RSA]] launched the [[Adelphi Charter]], aimed at creating an international policy statement to frame how governments should make balanced intellectual property law.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James (14 October 2005).

Another aspect of current U.S. Intellectual Property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works; thus, copyright protection can only be obtained in 'original' works of authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Philip |last=Bennet|title=Native Americans and Intellectual Property: the Necessity of Implementing Collective Ideals into Current United States Intellectual Property Laws|year= 2009 |ssrn=1498783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion in nature and scope of intellectual property laws===
[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (Assuming authors create their works by age 35 and live for seventy years)]]

Other criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property, both in duration and in scope.

In addition, as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, originators of technology have sought IP protection for the new technologies. Patents have been granted for living organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Council for Responsible Genetics, [http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomics/crg.html DNA Patents Create Monopolies on Living Organisms.] Accessed 2008.12.18.&lt;/ref&gt; (and in the United States, [[Plant breeders' rights|certain living organisms]] have been patentable for over a century).&lt;ref&gt;Plant Patents [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/plant/ USPTO.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also with respect to copyright, the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Wharton, "MPAA's Rebel With Cause Fights for Copyright Coin," Variety (August 3, 1992), Vol. 348, No. 2, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Fisher III, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property99/history.html The Growth of Intellectual Property:A History of the Ownership of Ideas in the United States] Eigentumskulturen im Vergleich (Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of the [[Internet]], and particularly distributed search engines like [[Kazaa]] and [[Gnutella]], have represented a challenge for copyright policy. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]], in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against [[copyright infringement]], which the industry calls "piracy". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company [[Napster]], and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based [[digital rights management]] tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[EU Copyright Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the [[Conditional Access Directive]] of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting [[public domain]] works, [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]], or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some [[copyleft]] licenses, like [[GNU GPL 3]], are designed to counter that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html |title=A Quick Guide to GPLv3 |author=Brett Smith |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=2007–2010 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for [[accessibility]] reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.

In the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of "trademark", as exemplified by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] ratified in 1994, which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law, or not at all, in member states. Pursuant to TRIPs, any [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is "capable of distinguishing" the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Beckman and Christa Pletcher (2009) [http://ipjournal.law.wfu.edu/files/2010/10/article.10.215.pdf Expanding Global Trademark Regulation] Wake Forest Intellectual Property Law Journal 10(2): 215–239&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017-2018, both the U.S. and the EU Commission simultaneously decided to depart from the [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|OECD BEPS Project]] timetable, which was set up in 2013 to combat IP BEPS tax tools like the above,&lt;ref name="BEPS Background"&gt;{{cite web|title=BEPS Project Background Brief|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/background-brief-inclusive-framework-for-beps-implementation.pdf|publisher=OECD|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launch their own anti-IP BEPS tax regimes:

The departure of the U.S. and EU Commission from the OECD BEPS Project process, is attributed to frustrations with the rise in IP as a key BEPS tax tool, creating intangible assets, which are then turned into royalty payment BEPS schemes (double Irish), and/or [[capital allowance]] BEPS schemes (capital allowances for intangibles).  In contrast, the OECD has spent years developing and advocating intellectual property as a legal and a GAAP accounting concept.&lt;ref name="un1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/09/11/new-un-tax-handbook-sets-lower-income-countries-oecd-beps/|title=New UN tax handbook: Lower-income countries vs OECD BEPS failure|publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU Commission's [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|€13 billion fine]] of Apple's pre 2015 double Irish IP BEPS tax scheme, is the largest corporate tax fine in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4472500/apple-eu-irish-tax-bill/|title=Apple vs. the E.U.

'''Kendell Geers''' is a [[South Africa]]n conceptual artist.

==Life==
Kendell Geers was born in Johannesburg into a white working-class Afrikaans family during the time of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Salon | Artist Talk | Manifesta 9: FIRED UP by Kendell Geers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGJDXFKIz0U&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becoming aware of the political struggles in his country, he ran away from home at the age of 15 to get involved in the anti-apartheid movement. 
Kendell finished his schooling at the end of 1984. At the beginning of 1985, to avoid conscription, he enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for a Fine Arts degree.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Siebrits,States of Emergency 1985-1990, "Irrespektiv." BOM / Actar, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1988, Kendell Geers was one of 143 young men who publicly refused to serve in the South African Defence Force and faced either a life in exile or six years' imprisonment in a civilian jail.&lt;ref&gt;Merret, C., Saunders, C., in Switzer L., Adhikari M., ''South Africa's Resistance'', Ohio University Press, 2000, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he left South Africa and lived for a brief period in exile in the United Kingdom and New York where he worked as an assistant to artist [[Richard Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Clive Kellner, Kendell Geers 1988-2012, Prestel, 2012, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was only after [[Nelson Mandela]] and other political prisoners' release from prison, that Geers could return from exile to Johannesburg without fear of being imprisoned. In 1990, he returned to [[Johannesburg]] where he worked as an artist, and art critic, curator and performance artist. The first work of art he created back on South African soil was "Bloody Hell", a ritual washing of his white [[Afrikaaner]] [[Boer]] body with his own fresh blood.&lt;ref name="Fin de Partie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sans|first=Jerome|title=Hang Grenades From My Heart|year=2012|publisher=Blue Kingfisher|isbn=9789881506474|pages=23–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rejecting everything his family and his community stood for, in 1993 he changed his name to Kendell Geers and his date of birth to May 1968 as a political act, reclaiming his identity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Bourriaud, ''Kendell Geers: A Proletarian Gnosis'', ''Kendell Geers 1988-2012'', Munich, Prestel, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Brussels in 2003.

==Work==
Sometimes described as a political artist, Kendell Geers is known best for using a variety of colors and materials that signal danger such as sirens, broken glass, and barbed wire in an attempt to examine power structures, social injustices, and establishment values. Geers has worked with different media ranging from objects to large scale installation, neon works, performances and video.
Geers also uses words as a means to explore the coding and reinterpretation of language and its meaning and to communicate with his audience.

===Early work===
His work had heavily political elements from 1988 to 2000, during which time Geers, explored the moral and ethical contradictions of the apartheid system through his practice.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; He developed a visual vocabulary characterized by provocation as well as humor by using found objects such as barbed wire or glass shards. By appropriating historical events and ideas, he focused on questions of relationship between individual and society. It was in this context that Geers changed his date of birth to May 1968, the start of the student and civil revolution, and joined every political party in the period before South Africa’s first democratic elections, from the extreme right-wing to the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition traces the shift and the development of Kendell Geers' aesthetic language|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=59989#.US94rjdhAqA|work=Art Daily|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, he expressed his doubts about the fetishization of party politics.

He participated in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1993, the first time since the anti-[[Apartheid]] boycotts that South African artists had been invited.

From 1999 until 2004, Geers worked as the curator and art consult for [[Gencor]] which was later bought out by [[BHP Billiton]]. The collection focused on artists and works of art that were central to the [[apartheid|Anti-Apartheid Movement]] spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Williamson, South African Art in the Nineties: Part I, II &amp; III, [http://www.artthrob.co.za/00jan/news.html Artthrob]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Geers edited and published ''Contemporary South African Art,'' with essays by [[Okwui Enwezor]], [[Olu Oguibe]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary South African Art'', Jonathan Ball Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|978-1-86842-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiated by his move to Brussels in 2000, his later European period is characterized by a more poetic aesthetic.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; Here, Geers transferred his incendiary practice into a post-colonial and increasingly global context, suggesting more universal themes like terrorism, spirituality, and mortality. As such, the artist’s life and work can be said to constitute a living archive composed of political events, photographs, letters, and literary texts that serve as a source of inspiration and represent a continuation of his oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=haus der kunst|url=http://www.hausderkunst.de/index.php?id=132&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 a Geers retrospective called "1988-2012" opened at the [[Haus der Kunst]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=welt&gt;{{cite news|last=Reitter-Welter|first=Barbara|title=Hinweis warnt vor Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article113480460/Hinweis-warnt-vor-Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung.html|newspaper=Die Welt|date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The exhibition divided his life and work into two decade-long periods, the first political phase until 2000, and the later more poetic phase.

===Manifesto===
In 2011 Geers wrote a Manifesto in which through a series of statements, he explores the link between political and natural revolutions, mourns the loss of our talent for revolution and the underlying causes, and gives us clues on how to remember our inner selves to live a more true life.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Arts: A Journal of South-North Cultural and Media Studies 27(6), An Van Dienderen &amp; Kris Rutten, 2013, p. 655-660.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side projects==
Together with musician Patrick Codenys ([[Front 242]]) Kendell Geers formed the Belgium Audio-Visual group "[[thefucKINGFUCKS]]" in 2007. The project grew out of the now defunct "[[Red Snyper]]" collaboration between Geers and Codenys.

==Exhibitions==
He has exhibited globally since 1993 and participated in numerous exhibitions including [[Documenta]], the [[Carnegie International]], Havana Biennial, Istanbul Biennial, Kwang Ju Biennial, Taipei Biennial, [[Gwangju Biennale]], Lyon Biennial, [[Glasstress]] at the Venice Biennale, as well as presented solo exhibitions in the CCA Cincinnati, [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst]] Gent, [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltic Museum Presents Kendell Geers|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/10544/Baltic-Museum-Presents-Kendell-Geers/?month=&amp;year=|work=Design Taxi|accessdate=28 February 2013|date=3 Aug 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspen Art Museum, MOCA in Rome, Migros Museum, Palais de Tokyo, the CAC in Lyon and Haus der Kunst in Munich.

Domestic [[U.S. Air Mail]] was established as a new class of mail service by the [[United States]] [[Post Office Department]] (POD) on May 15, 1918, with the inauguration of the Washington&amp;ndash;Philadelphia&amp;ndash;New York route. Special [[postage stamps]] were issued for use with this service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400048427 The Official Blackbook Price Guide to U.S. Postage Stamps 2005], 27th Edition (Official Blackbook Price Guide to United States Postage Stamps) by Thomas E.

[[Scott catalog]]ed stamps received a "C" designation for airmail issues beginning in 1940.  Designated for international mail, and showing a small airplane, the January, 2012 $1.05 Scenic America series issue was designated C150.  However, with the January, 2013 issue of the $1.10 Global [[Forever Stamp]] no specific airmail purpose was shown in the design.  Rather, the Postal Service stated that this "stamp offers a single price for any First-Class Mail International 1-ounce letter to any country in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.usps.com/store/browse/productDetailSingleSku.jsp?productId=S_578804&amp;categoryId=subcatS_S_Sheets Global Forever]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a regular series Scott number, 4740, was designated.

==Identified fictional colors==
This is a '''list of fictional colors''' which were invented for a work of fiction.
*'''Actinic''' is a new use of an older word by [[Larry Niven]] in ''[[The Ringworld Engineers]]'' for the human sensation of color in vision-damaging ultraviolet light – for example, as seen in welding-torch light (see [[Actinism]]). The term "actinic light" was also used in E.E. Smith's [[Lensman series|''Lensmen'' series]] to describe UV light, and in the novel ''Forlorn Hope'' to describe the effect of a military laser weapon upon a cloud of mercury droplets. '''Actinic''' was also mentioned in Ambrose Bierce's short story ''[[The Damned Thing (Short Story)]]'' published in 1898. It simply referred to a color that humans cannot see.
*'''Ultra Indigo''' was a color and plot point in an episode of the television series ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', possessing the power to decelerate other photons and distort time.
*'''Amarklor''' and '''Kalish''' are colors in the ultraviolet range seen by [[Klingon]]s in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel ''[[Pawns and Symbols]]'' by Majliss Larson. In this story, Klingons see amarklor between violet and kalish, but see the color red as black.
*'''[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|Garrow]]'''&amp;nbsp; and '''Infra-White'''&amp;nbsp; – colors invented in the ''[[Nebulous]]'' episode "Madness Is a Strange Colour". Both colors affect the human mind in odd ways, either destroying or creating sanity. Professor Nebulous claims that he discovered Infra-White by looking ''underneath and behind'' the visible spectrum.
*'''[[Fuligin]]'''&amp;nbsp;– both a color and a textile having that color, associated with the Guild of Torturers in [[Gene Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Shadow of the Torturer]]''. The color is defined as "the color that is darker than black" and also as "the color of soot". In comparison, see the real colors [[super black]] and [[vantablack]].
*'''[[Grue and bleen]]'''&amp;nbsp;– colors that change after an arbitrary, but fixed time; coined by philosopher Nelson Goodman to illustrate what he calls "the new [[riddle of induction]]."&lt;ref name="Goodman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Mull and glow]]'''&amp;nbsp;– an infrared and an ultraviolet color seen by futuristic humans in Victor Emmanuel's ''The Messiah of the Cylinder'' (1917).
*'''[[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hooloovoo|Hooloovoo]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a superintelligent shade of the color blue in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]]. In ''[[Life, the Universe, and Everything]]'', Adams mentions [[Agrajag]]'s lair as being painted in "the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the way."&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt by Tom Snyder of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|H2G2]], located here [http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/tomsnyder/hg-3-18.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Octarine]]'''&amp;nbsp;– the color of magic in the ''[[Discworld]]'' fantasy novels, described as resembling a fluorescent greenish-yellow purple.
*'''[[Squant]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a fourth primary color publicized by the experimental band [[Negativland]] in 1993.
*[[A Voyage to Arcturus#Names|'''Jale''', '''Ulfire''' and '''Dolm''']]&amp;nbsp;– Two new primary colors (Jale and Ulfire) and a compound color of ulfire and blue (dolm) from ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' (1920) by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]. Jale and Ulfire are described as "Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous."
*The colors [[The Stars My Destination|'''tang''' and '''burn''']] are colors in the [[infrared]] range seen by the [[albino]] [[mutant]] Olivia Presteign (whose [[Visual perception|vision]] only functions in the infrared) in the 1956 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' by [[Alfred Bester]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher, Anthony]], Editor ''A Treasury of Great Science Fiction'' Garden City, New York:1959—Doubleday Volume Two—''The Stars My Destination'' by Alfred Bester, Pages 361–522—Color reference Page 465&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Berl''', '''Crynor''', '''Nusp''', and '''Onsible''' are colors from the ''Star Wars'' universe. They are said to be somewhere in the ultraviolet spectrum, which can be seen by [[Hutts]] and [[Kaminoans]] and some others.
*'''Htun''' is a color similar to black only seen by gnomes in the book ''[[Fairest (novel)|Fairest]]'' by [[Gail Carson Levine]].
*'''Sangoire''' is a color of red 'so dark and saturated it [is] almost black', it is also described as 'the color of blood spilled in moonlight', seen in the [[Kushiel's Legacy]] Series by [[Jacqueline Carey]].
*'''Gloxym''' is a fictional color coined by [[Kibology|Kibo]] on his FAQ. He describes Gloxym as the true color of the sky.
*'''Smaudre''' is a color from the fairy world in [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[Suldrun's Garden]]''. The fairy folk find it lovely, but to the human eye, it appears colorless.
*'''Rawn''' and '''Pallow''' are colors associated with circles of magic beyond white, black, purple and green in Jack Vance's ''Green Magic''.
*'''Plaid''' is one of the colors outside of the natural human spectrum visible to large intelligent [[arachnid]]s in [[Vernor Vinge]]'s novel ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]''.
*'''Shattan''' is said to be a fourth primary color for Yalia people in ''[[Wonderland Online]]''. It is said to have calming properties and appears to humans as a combination of golden and infraviolet colors.{{citation needed|reason=No mention of Shattan at the linked page.|date=July 2014}}
*'''Flange''' is "every color of the rainbow, all at once" in the book ''[[The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles]]'' by [[Julie Andrews Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-reading.me/bookreader.php/1007836/Edwards_-_The_Last_of_the_Really_Great_Whangdoodles.html|title=Book: The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles|first=Edwards Julie|last=Andrews|date=|website=www.e-reading.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is used by the Whangdoodle to impress his bride and it is stated that it is very hard to do. The Whangdoodle is also capable of turning colors such as crash pink, some of which may or may not exist.
*'''Apocyan''', '''Cosmogone''', '''Gant''', '''Irrigo''', '''Peligin''', '''Violant''', and '''Viric''', collectively known as 'the Neathbow', are colors found only in the subterranean Neath of Failbetter Games' ''[[Fallen London]]'' universe. They are impossible shades of existing colours: apocyan is a bright pale aqua, irrigo is brilliant purple, violant has been depicted multiple ways but is usually an iridescent wine-red, cosmogene is golden yellow, gant is beige with a slight reddish tinge, peligin is an extremely dark blue-gray that's almost black, and viric is emerald green. Most of them also have supernatural properties: irrigo causes forgetfulness, violant improves memory, cosmogone and viric are heavily associated with dreams. Gant is the colour that "remains when all other colours are eaten".
*'''El Gris/Gray''' is considered the "third" and an unreal color in ''[[La Historia de los Colores|La Historia de los Colores/The Story of Colors]]'' by [[Subcomandante Marcos]]. It only exists so the black and the white don't bump into each other so hard – it does so by painting the dusks and dawns.
*'''Gloze''' and '''Flush''' are infrared colors mentioned in the book ''[[Neverness]]'' by [[David Zindell]].

==Unnamed fictional colors==
*''[[The Colour Out of Space]]''&amp;nbsp;– a vaguely described alien hue, from the story of that name by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (1927).
*In ''[[The Golden Key]]'', an 1867 fairy tale by [[George MacDonald]], a boy sees additional colors in a [[rainbow]] in [[Fairy]]land: "He could count all the seven colours, and could see shade after shade beyond the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous and mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before."
*In the [[Mars|Martian]] ([[Barsoom]]) novels of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the spectrum is divided into nine colors rather than the earthly seven, and the two unearthly colors are called "the eighth ray" and "the ninth ray". [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] describes the additional colors as "... two beautiful rays which, to me, were new and nameless. I cannot describe them any more than you could describe red to a blind man. I only know that they were beautiful in the extreme." The eighth ray exerts an anti-gravity force and is trapped in tanks by the Red Martians to levitate and propel their flying craft. The ninth ray is processed by the great atmosphere factory to create breathable air for Barsoom.
*In the 1942 novel ''[[Perelandra]]'', [[C. S. Lewis]] describes the colors of angelic beings when they manifest themselves: "We think that when creatures of the hypersomatic kind choose to 'appear' to us, they are not in fact affecting our retina at all, but directly manipulating the relevant parts of our brain. If so, it is quite possible that they can produce there the sensations we should have if our eyes were capable of receiving those colours in the spectrum which are actually beyond their range." (Chapter 16)
*In [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] ''[[From a Buick 8]]'', the characters encounter an alien plant with an unearthly color, which the narrator describes as "corpse white".

{{other uses|Madi (disambiguation)}}

'''Madí''' (or MADI; also known as Grupo Madí or Arte Madí) is an international abstract (or concrete) art movement initiated in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946 by the Hungarian-Argentinian artist and poet [[Gyula Kosice]], and the Uruguayans [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] and [[Rhod Rothfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Madí: Nelson Di Maggio, curador de retrospectiva sobre Carmelo Arden Quin|url=http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2010/11/made-in-madi/|publisher=La Diaria|accessdate=14 June 2012|author=Riccardo Boglione|date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement focuses on creating [[concrete art]] (i.e., non-representational [[geometric abstraction]]) and encompasses all branches of art (the plastic and pictorial arts, music, literature, theater, architecture, dance, etc.). The artists in the Madí movement consider the concrete, physical reality of the art medium and play with the traditional conventions of [[Western art history|Western art]] (for instance, by creating works on irregularly-shaped canvases).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention "Concrete Invention."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. Web. 30 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork of Madí movement appeared in eight issues of its magazine, ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'', published between 1947 and 1954.

== Historical Context ==
The Madí art movement formed as a reaction to the major concrete art movement in Argentina at the time, known as the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI), whose art was perceived by the Madí group as being too strict in their method of creating concrete art, resulting in a lack of expression in their artworks. 

Operating under the rule of Colonel [[Juan Perón|Perón]], whose time in power was characterized by a volatile political climate, the Madí artists used their art to make statements with social and political implications. One of the most overt criticisms made by the Madí movement criticized cultural authorities in the ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'' magazine'','' commenting "[t]he last submission to the Venice Biennial has signified for Argentina a blunt negation of the new [artistic] values. We invite competent authorities to stop and compare the true current of contemporary plastic arts with the submissions that today put us [our country] half a century behind", which vaguely attack the aesthetic choices of certain cultural officers under Perón. According to [[Pérez-Barreiro]], Madí and Concrete art (referring to the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI)) are the artistic parallel(s) of the political phenomenon of [[Peronism]]. These artists were also seen as combining modern art with Communist ideology. Some scholars, including Barreiro, saw the government was an outspoken critic against concrete art as a whole, whereas others such as [[Andrea Giunta]] assert that the Madí and Concrete groups were not victimized under Perón's regime; rather, they "coexisted on its margins".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The political regime of Perón made use of both linguistic and visual images for propaganda purposes. This is seen in his use of an image, "the shirtless workers" (los descamisados), as an alternative to the concept of the working class. This image had strong connections and connotations with the male worker, shirtless and, unrealistically, without much affliction. In a speech given October 17th, 1946 at Plaza de Mayo, Perón addressed the workers in speeches as "mis queridos descamisados" (my loving shirtless workers). At this speech, he declared October 17th the "Day of the Shirtless Workers" and stated "I don’t want to govern over men but over their hearts, because mine beats in unison with the heart of each shirtless worker, which I interpret and love above all things.” The use of representations to create propaganda opened up a clear target for the Madí artists to oppose.

== Origin of the name ==
Gyula Kosice, who also operated under the pseudonym Raymundo Rasas Pèt, has explained that the name for the movement is derived from the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] motto in the [[Spanish Civil War]], "''Madrí, Madrí, no pasarán''" ("Madrid, Madrid, they will not make it in", i.e., the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist forces]] will not invade Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;[http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml "Entrevista a Gyula Kosice"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629170755/http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml |date=29 June 2012 }}, ''Ñusleter Cultura'', 12 de agosto de 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is most typically understood as an acronym for ''Movimiento, Abstracción, Dimensión, Invención'' (Movement, Abstraction, Dimension, Invention).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
A Madí work is non-figurative and non-representational; it has a cut-out or irregularly-shaped form, which takes away the viewer's perception of spatial depth that a rectangular frame provides; its colors are flat and sharply defined; it is often three-dimensional and sometimes articulated and/or mechanical; and it is playful in spirit. Madí artists were concerned with creating artworks that were autonomous with functions that naturally transcend the physical features that constitute the work. Introducing elements of transformation and ambiguity were techniques commonly employed by these artists to avoid representation as well as avoid the fixity of representations. In painted works, some artists would intentionally lower the legibility of the design.

The incorporation of unusual materials into artworks is seen throughout the art movement movement; this includes Plexiglas, fluorescent tubes, neon lights, water, metal, and other materials. An example of this is seen in [[Gyula Kosice|Kosice's]] first hydraulic piece, ''La arquitectura del agua: Hidro-escultura (The Architecture of Water: Hydro-Sculpture)'', which utilized light and water interaction.

Madí artists sought to combat representational forms because this art reflected and perpetuated class-based social organizations. They believed that representational images "forced others to relate to concepts, connotations, and feelings which were superfluous to the object itself... which enticed individuals into supporting class-based organizations". The Concrete art they produced was meant to have a reality that was self-contained. In other words, the reality of the art ended in the object. In the minds of the Madí artists, "Concrete art was worthy as a contribution to social liberation" because it helped its audience grasp true reality while standing against the concepts, connotations and feelings associated with art. To state this differently, exposing people to what is actually reality allows people to eventually confront myths perpetuated by the bourgeois that has suppressed revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Madí is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946. Today, the MADI movement has over 60 members — painters, sculptors, architects and poets — working in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Japan, [[Argentina]] and the United States. One prominent figure behind this fifty years of artistic creation is [[Carmelo Arden Quin]].

== The Madí Manifesto ==
The Madí Manifesto was created to defend the importance of invention in the light of limitations imposed on concrete art by the excessive rationalism of European concrete art. This strictness of form in concrete art was also demonstrated by the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI). The manifesto also called for "the integration of the nonorthogonal framework into representational space".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geometric Abstraction: Latin American Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection|last=Bois|first=Yve-Alan|publisher=Harvard University Art Museums|year=2001|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Madí Dictionary ==
In written works, artists "disrupted the construction of semantically coherent structures" to avoid attaching meaning to the art and the possibility of representation. The Madí created a dictionary that accomplished the opposite of what a normal dictionary does in that it confused and distorted the meanings of words and made up words. The following excerpt is from the Madí dictionary, which demonstrates a correct grammatical structure that relates ideas that are impossible to interpret meaningfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is an example of this incoherent construction which prevents interpretation:&lt;blockquote&gt;M               &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Maclode: Upward hill. / Slope to insinuate land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meril: Kidnapping of flat centimeters. / ''Madícional'' [‘Madí-like’ or ‘of Madí origin’] opposition and resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Miogue: Account of events in which the authors of great answers participated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Molois: Site where the most varied adjectives are collected. / ''Fam''. Insult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Musver: About the manner to focus in photography the liveliest glare of a childhood memory. / Fixation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Macichud: Line of shade that emits a loosening of gray beams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;N&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nandy: Arrangement for new personal cuño.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nem-Er: Record of instances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nigs: Opening that is left so that a cluster of enchanted powder emigrates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Novoh: Shooter that the riverside authority exercises to learn the coastal ruling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Why MADI? ==
To the question, "Why MADI?" Josee Lapeyrere, who met Arden Quin in 1962 and has since participated with her poem-objects in most of the events organized by the movement, replies: "MADI's goal is to be rigorous, inventive, gay and ludic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MADI internacional 50 años después: exposición del 7 de marzo al 3 de abril de 1996, Centro de Exposiciones y Congresos, Zaragoza|last=Osornio|first=Cesar Lopez|last2=Roitman|first2=Ibercaja|publisher=Ibercaja|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the importance to which they accord spiritual and imaginative games, even the most serious MADI artists can be described as playful. Already in 1795, Schiller focused on "the inborn playful nature of man" as an explanation for his production of art forms. In his essay, "[[Homo Ludens]]" ("Ludic Man") (1938), [[Johan Huizinga]] observed that, "Play reveals an aspiration to beauty. The terms we use to designate the elements of play are, for the most part, the same as those utilized in the aesthetic realm: beauty, tension, balancing, equilibrium, gradation, contrast, etc. Like art, play engages and delivers. It absorbs. It captivates, or, in other words, it charms. It is full of those two supremely noble qualities which man expresses through rhythm and harmony." The French art critic [[Dominique Jacquemin]] also remarks that, "It is possible that Arden Quin's passion for game playing led him to create MADI, the only remaining contemporary art movement which can pride itself in possessing both coherence and a truly international outlook."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], used by [[André Gide|Gide]] to demonstrate the technique of ''mise en abyme'']]
In [[Western art history]], '''''Mise en abyme''''' ({{IPA-fr|miz ɑ̃n‿abim}}; also '''''mise en abîme''''') is a formal technique of placing a copy of an image within itself, often in a way that suggests an infinitely recurring sequence. In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the technique of inserting a story within a story. The term is derived from [[heraldry]] and literally means "placed into [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]". It was first appropriated for modern criticism by the French author [[André Gide]].

A common sense of the phrase is the visual experience of standing between two [[mirror]]s, seeing as a result an infinite reproduction of one's image.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheinhardt|first=Dagmar|title=Youtopia. a Passion for the Dark: Architecture at the Intersection Between Digital Processes and Theatrical Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38_ZvEwnGtQC&amp;pg=PT42|year=2012|publisher=Freerange Press|isbn=978-0-9808689-1-3|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[Droste effect]], in which a picture appears within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Nänny. Max and Fischer, Olga, ''The Motivated Sign: Iconicity in Language and Literature'' p.&amp;nbsp;37, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2001) {{ISBN|90-272-2574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is named after the 1904 [[Droste]] cocoa package, which depicts a woman holding a tray bearing a Droste cocoa package, which bears a smaller version of her image.&lt;ref&gt;Törnqvist, Egil. ''Ibsen: A Doll's House'', p. 105, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-47866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
[[File:Royal Arms of United Kingdom (1816-1837).svg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the United Kingdom 1816–37]]
In the terminology of [[heraldry]], the ''abyme'' is the center of a [[coat of arms]]. The term ''mise en abyme'' then meant put in the center. It described a coat of arms that appears as a smaller shield in the center of a larger one (see [[Droste effect]]).

A complex example of ''mise en abyme'' is seen in the [[coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom#After the Acts of Union 1707|for the period 1816–1837]], as used by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The [[crown of Charlemagne]] is placed ''en abyme'' within the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of [[Hanover]], which in turn is ''en abyme'' within the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Another example is the two-headed eagle in the modern [[coat of arms of Russia]], which holds a [[sceptre]] topped by a similar eagle holding a similar sceptre.

==Medieval examples==
[[File:Istanbul.Hagia Sophia075.jpg|thumb|300px|Southwestern entrance mosaic of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, depicting both Hagia Sophia itself and Constantinople, both offered to Jesus and the Virgin Mary]]
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

While [[art historian]]s working on the early-modern period adopted this phrase and interpreted it as showing artistic "self awareness", medievalists tended not to use it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Many examples, however, can be found in the pre-modern era, as in a [[mosaic]] from the [[Hagia Sophia]] dated to the year 944. To the left, [[Justinian I]] offers the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] the Hagia Sophia, which contains the mosaic itself. To the right, [[Constantine I]] offers the city of [[Constantinople]] (now known as Istanbul), which itself contains the Hagia Sophia.

More medieval examples can be found in the collection of articles ''Medieval mise-en-abyme: the object depicted within itself'',&lt;ref name='mise'/&gt; in which Stuart Whatling conjectures that the self-references sometimes are used to strengthen the symbolism of gift-giving by documenting the act of giving on the object itself. An example of this self-referential gift-giving appears in the [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] in the [[Vatican Museum]], which features Cardinal [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi]] as the giver of the altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical theory and art history==
In [[Western art history]], ''mise en abyme'' is a formal technique in which an image contains a smaller copy of itself, in a sequence appearing to recur infinitely; "[[recursion|recursive]]" is another term for this. The modern meaning of the phrase originates with the author [[André Gide]] who used it to describe self-reflexive embeddings in various art forms and to describe what he sought in his own work.&lt;ref name='mise'&gt;[http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf Medieval ''mise-en-abyme'': the object depicted within itself (collection of papers)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033517/http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Gide cites both paintings such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]] and literary forms such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of the "play within a play" device in ''[[Hamlet]]'', where a theatrical company presents a performance for the characters that illuminates a thematic aspect of the play itself. This use of the phrase ''mise en abyme'' was picked up by scholars and popularized in the 1977 book ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'' by [[Lucien Dällenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Dällenbach, ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'', Paris, Seuil, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and film==
''Mise en abyme'' occurs within a text when there is a reduplication of images or concepts referring to the textual whole. ''Mise en abyme'' is a play of signifiers within a text, of sub-texts mirroring each other. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Mise-en-abime" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; This mirroring can attain a level where meaning may become unstable and, in this respect, may be seen as part of the process of [[deconstruction]]. The film-within-a-film, where a film contains a plot about the making of a movie, is an example of ''mise en abyme''. The film being made within the film refers, through its ''[[mise en scène]]'', to the real film being made. The spectator sees film equipment, stars getting ready for the take, crew sorting out the various directorial needs. The narrative of the film within the film may directly reflect the one in the real film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/3265.ctl|Hayward, Susan. ''Cinema Studies Key Concepts''. New York: Routledge, 2006.] Accessed 2009-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; An example is ''[[La Nuit américaine]]'' (1973) by [[François Truffaut]].

In [[film]], the meaning of ''mise en abyme'' is similar to the artistic definition, but also includes the idea of a "dream within a dream". For example, a character awakens from a dream and later discovers that s/he is [[false awakening|still dreaming]]. Activities similar to dreaming, such as unconsciousness and virtual reality, also are described as ''mise en abyme''. This is seen in the film ''[[eXistenZ]]'' where the two protagonists never truly know whether or not they are out of the game. It also becomes a prominent element of [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'' (2008). A more recent instance can be found in the film ''[[Inception]]'' (2010).  Classic filmic examples include the snow globe in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) which provides a clue to the film's core mystery, and the discussion of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s written works (particularly "[[The Purloined Letter]]") in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Band of Outsiders]]'' (1964). 

In [[literary criticism]], ''mise en abyme'' is a type of [[frame story]], in which the core narrative may be used to illuminate some aspect of the framing story. The term is used in deconstruction and deconstructive literary criticism as a paradigm of the [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] nature of language, that is, of the way language never quite reaches the foundation of reality because it refers in a frame-within-a-frame way, to other language, which refers to other language, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ross Chambers |title=Story and Situation: Narrative Seduction and the Power of Fiction |year=1984 |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/story-and-situation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">'''Morphology''', broadly, is the study of form or structure.  '''[[Folkloristics|Folkloristic]] morphology''', then, is the study of the structure of folklore and [[fairy tale]]s. 

Folkloristic morphology owes its existence to two seminal researchers and theorists: Russian scholar [[Vladimir Propp]] and Finnish folklorist [[Antti Aarne]].

Antti Aarne's theories, enlarged and expanded by American folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] in 1961 and by [[Hans-Jörg Uther]] in 2004, look at [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] rather than actions &amp;ndash; for example, "a soldier makes a deal with the devil" or "a soldier marries the youngest of three sisters". More than 2500 folk and fairy tales have been cataloged under this [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]; the AaTh or [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] number is as well-known to [[folklorists]] as [[Francis James Child]]'s identification of [[Child Ballads|ballads]] are to scholars of [[folk songs]].

[[Vladimir Propp]] was a Russian [[Structuralism (linguistics)|structuralist]] scholar.  He criticized Aarne's work for ignoring what [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] ''did'' in a tale, and analysed the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|basic plot]], or action, components of Russian folk tales to identify their simplest irreducible narrative elements. His ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'' was published in Russian in 1928 and influenced [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]], though it received little attention from Western scholars until it was translated into English in the 1950s.  

In the [[Alexander Afanasyev|Afanasyev]]'s collection of Russian fairy tales, Propp found a limited number of plot elements or "functions" that constructed all. These elements occurred in a standard, consistent sequence. He derived thirty-one generic functions, such as "a difficult task is proposed" or "donor tests the hero" or "a magical agent is directly transferred".

'''Neomodern''' or '''neomodernist''' art is a reaction to the complexity of [[postmodern architecture]] and [[eclecticism]], seeking greater simplicity.

==Architecture==
Neomodern architecture continues [[Modern architecture|modernism]] as a dominant form of architecture in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in corporate offices. It tends to be used for certain segments of buildings. Many residential houses tend to embrace [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[New Classical Architecture|new classical]] and [[neo-eclectic]] styles, for instance, and major monuments today most often opt for [[starchitect]] inspired uniqueness. 
Neomodern architecture shares many of the basic characteristics of modernism. Both reject classical ornamentation, decorations, and deliberate ambitions to continue pre-modernist traditions. Neomodernist buildings, like modernist ones, are designed to be largely monolithic and functional.

==Artist group==
The neomodern artist group was founded in 1997 by [[Guy Denning]]&lt;ref name=sherwin&gt;Sherwin, Brian. [http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2006/11/art-space-talk-guy-denning.html "Art Space Talk: Guy Denning"], myartspace.com, 14 November 2006. Retrieved 31 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on the premise that the diversity of contemporary art was being stifled by the state supported art institutions and organisations. The group have no common style or media but there is a bias towards figurative painting. Original artists listed: [[James Butler (artist)|Jim Butler]], [[David Cobley]], [[Emily Cole]], [[Mark Demsteader]], [[Guy Denning]], [[Ian Francis]], [[Juno Doran]], [[Ghislaine Howard]], [[David Jamin (artist)|Jamin]], [[Maya Kulenovic]], [[Mark Stephen Meadows]], [[Antony Micallef]], [[Motorboy]], [[Carol Peace]], [[Graeme Robbins]], [[Harry Simmonds]], [[Tom Wilmott]], [[Franklin Torres]], [[Kit Wise]] and [[Claire Zakiewicz]].

'''Obverse''' and its [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]], '''reverse''', refer to the two flat faces of [[coin]]s and some other two-sided objects, including [[Currency#Paper money|paper money]], [[flag terminology|flags]], [[seal (emblem)|seals]], [[medal]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[old master print]]s and other works of art, and printed fabrics. In this usage, ''obverse'' means the [[wikt:front|front]] face of the object and ''reverse'' means the [[wikt:back|back]] face. The obverse of a coin is commonly called ''heads'', because it often depicts the head of a prominent person, and the reverse ''tails''.

In fields of [[scholarly method|scholarship]] outside [[numismatics]], the term ''front'' is more commonly used than ''obverse'', while usage of ''reverse'' is widespread.

The equivalent terms used in [[codicology]], [[manuscript]] studies, [[printmaking|print]] studies and [[publishing]] are [[recto and verso|"recto" and "verso"]].

[[Image:Tetradrachma från Aten (omkr 490 fKr, ur Nordisk familjebok).png|thumb|On a Tetradrachma of Athens, struck {{circa|lk=no|490 BC}}, the head of [[Athena]], ''(left)'', is regarded as the obverse because of its larger scale and because it is a portrait head; the entire owl is depicted in a smaller scale on the reverse.]]
Generally, the side of a coin with the larger-scale image will be called the obverse (especially if the image is a single head) and, if that does not serve to distinguish them, the side that is more typical of a wide range of coins from that location will be called the obverse. Following this principle, in the most famous of [[Ancient Greek coinage|ancient Greek coins]], the [[tetradrachm]] of Athens, the obverse is the head of [[Athena]] and the reverse is her owl.  Similar versions of these two images, both symbols of the state, were used on the Athenian coins for more than two centuries.

In the many republics of ancient Greece&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ancient-greece.org/|title=Ancient Greece|first=Thomas|last=Sakoulas|website=www.ancient-greece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as Athens or [[Corinth]], one side of their coins would have a symbol of the state, usually their patron goddess or her symbol, which remained constant through all of the coins minted by that state, which is regarded as the obverse of those coins. The opposite side may have varied from time to time. In ancient Greek monarchical coinage, the situation continued whereby a larger image of a [[deity]], is called the obverse, but a smaller image of a monarch appears on the other side which is called the reverse.

[[Image:Tetradrachme.wmt.jpg|thumb|Obverse of the tetradrachm of [[Alexander the Great]], intended to be seen as a deity, wearing the attributes of the hero, [[Heracles]]/[[Hercules]]. 325{{nbsp}}BC.]]
In a [[Western world|Western]] [[monarchy]], it has been customary, following the tradition of the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic monarchs]] and then the [[Roman emperor]]s, for the currency to bear the head of the monarch on one side, which is almost always regarded as the obverse. This change happened in the coinage of [[Alexander the Great]], which continued to be minted long after his death. After his conquest of [[ancient Egypt]], he allowed himself to be depicted on the obverse of coins as a [[god-king]], at least partly because he thought this would help secure the allegiance of the Egyptians, who had regarded their previous monarchs, the [[pharaoh]]s, as divine.  The various Hellenistic rulers who were his successors followed his tradition and kept their images on the obverse of coins.

[[Image:Solidus-Justinian II-Christ b-sb1413.jpg|thumb|left|''Solidus'' of [[Justinian II]] after 705. Christ is on the obverse (''left''), the emperor on the reverse.]]
A movement back to the earlier tradition of a deity being placed on the obverse occurred in [[Byzantine coinage]], where a head of Christ became the obverse and a head or portrait (half or full-length) of the emperor became considered the reverse. The introduction of this style in the gold coins of [[Justinian II]] from the year 695 provoked the Islamic [[Caliph]], [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]], who previously had copied Byzantine designs, replacing Christian symbols with [[Islam]]ic equivalents, finally to develop a distinctive ''Islamic style'', with just lettering on both sides of their coins. This script alone style then was used on nearly all Islamic coinage until the modern period.  The type of Justinian II was revived after the end of [[Iconoclasm]], and with variations remained the norm until the end of the Empire. Without images, therefore, it is not always easy to tell which side will be regarded as the obverse without some knowledge.

After 695 Islamic coins avoided all images of persons and usually contained script alone. The side expressing the [[Six Kalimas]] (the Islamic profession of faith) is usually defined as the obverse.

A [[Convention (norm)|convention]] exists typically to display the obverse to the left (or above) and the reverse to the right (or below) in photographs and museum displays, but this is not invariably observed.

==Modern coins==
The [[form follows function|form]] of [[currency]] follows its function, which is to serve as a readily accepted [[medium of exchange]] of [[Value (economics)|value]].  Normally, this function rests on a [[Sovereign state|state]] as guarantor of the value: either as ''trustworthy'' guarantor of the kind and amount of [[metal]] in a [[coin]], or as ''powerful'' guarantor of the continuing acceptance of [[token coin]]s.

Traditionally, most states have been [[monarchy|monarchies]] where the person of the [[monarch]] and the state were equivalent for most purposes. For this reason, the ''obverse'' side of a modern piece of currency is the one that evokes that reaction by invoking the strength of the state, and that side almost always depicts a [[symbol]] of the state, whether it be the monarch or otherwise.

If not provided for on the obverse, the reverse side usually contains information relating to a coin's role as medium of exchange (such as the value of the coin). Additional space typically reflects the issuing country's culture or government, or evokes some aspect of the state's territory.

==Specific currencies==

===Coins of the European Union===
[[Image:N22978 2 eur aversas.jpg|thumb|100px|National side (obverse) of a Lithuanian 2€ coin]]
Regarding the [[euro]], some confusion regarding the obverse and reverse of the [[euro coins]] exists. Officially, as agreed by the informal Economic and Finance Ministers Council of Verona in April 1996, and despite the fact that a number of countries have a different design for each coin, the distinctive national side for the circulation coins is the ''obverse'' and the common European side (which includes the coin value) is the ''reverse''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:264:0038:0039:EN:PDF Commission Recommendation of 29 September 2003 on a common practice for changes to the design of national obverse sides of euro circulation coins] (PDF), [[Official Journal of the European Union|OJ]] L&amp;nbsp;264, 2003-10-15, pp. 38–39; EU doc. nr. C(2003) 3388.&lt;/ref&gt; This rule does not apply to the collector coins as they do not have a common side.

A number of the designs used for obverse national sides of [[euro coins]] were taken from the reverse of the nations' former pre-euro coins. Several countries (such as [[Spain]] and [[Belgium]]) continue to use portraits of the reigning monarch; while the [[Coins of the Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] continues to use the State Arms, as on its earlier issues.

===Coins of Japan===
[[Image:500JPY.JPG|thumb|200px|¥500 coin, the obverse showing a [[Paulownia]] plant, the reverse showing the value "500", and the year 2006 (平成十八年, ''[[heisei]] juu-hachi nen'')]]
In Japan, from 1897 to the end of [[World War II]], the following informal conventions existed:
*the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] (or Chrysanthemum Crest), representing the imperial family, appeared on all coins, and this side was regarded as the obverse;
*the other side, on which the date appeared, was regarded as the reverse.

The Chrysanthemum Crest was no longer used after the war, and so (equally informally):
*the side on which the date appears continues to be regarded as the reverse;
*the side without the date is regarded as the obverse.

===Coins of the United Kingdom===
[[Image:EdwardVIIIcoin.jpg|thumb|150px|A left-facing portrait of Edward VIII would have broken tradition.]]
Following ancient tradition, the obverse of coins of the [[United Kingdom]] (and predecessor kingdoms going back to the [[middle ages]]) almost always feature the head of the monarch.

By tradition, each British monarch faces in the opposite direction of his or her predecessor; this is said to date from 1661, with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] turning his back on [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Hence, [[George VI]] faced left and the present [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] faces right. The only break in this tradition almost occurred in 1936 when [[Edward VIII]], believing his left side to be superior to his right, insisted on his image facing left, as his father's image had. No official legislation prevented his wishes being granted, so left-facing obverses were prepared for minting. Very few examples were struck before he [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] later that year, but none bearing this portrait ever were issued officially. When George VI acceded to the throne, his image was placed to face left, implying that, had any coins been minted with Edward's portrait the obverses would have depicted Edward facing right and maintained the tradition.

Current UK coinage features the following abbreviated Latin inscription: D(ei) G(ratia) REG(ina) F(idei) D(efensor) (''[[By the Grace of God]], Queen [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]''). Earlier issues, before 1954, included BRITT(anniarum) OMN(ium) (''of all the Britains''{{snd}}that is, Britain and its dominions) and before 1949 IND(iae) IMP(erator) (''[[Emperor of India]]'').

===Coins of the United States===
The United States specifies what appears on the obverse and reverse of its currency. The specifications mentioned here imply the use of all upper-case letters, although they appear here in upper and lower case letters for the [[Typography|legibility]] of the article.

[[Image:1 us dollar 1979.jpg|thumb|200px|US dollar coin, with the obverse side showing [[Susan B. Anthony]], the words "Liberty" and "In God We Trust", and the year 1979; the reverse side shows the words "One Dollar", "United States of America", and "E Pluribus Unum", and an [[eagle]] carrying a laurel branch.]]
The [[United States government]] long adhered to including all of the following:
*Obverse:
**"[[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]]"
**"[[In God We Trust]]"
** The four digits of a year, that of minting or issue
*Reverse:
**"United States of America"
**"''[[E Pluribus Unum]]''"
**Words (not digits) expressing the name or assigned value of the item, e.g., "Quarter Dollar", "One Dime", "Five Cents"

The ten-year series of [[State Quarters|Statehood Quarters]], whose issue began in 1999, was seen as calling for more space and more flexibility in the design of the reverse.{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=The series was seen as calling for something? That doesn't make a lot of sense, at least to a non-expert.}} A law specific to this series and the corresponding time period permits the following:
*Obverse:
**as before:
***"Liberty"
***"[[In God We Trust]]"
**instead of on the reverse:
***"United States of America"
***The words expressing assigned value of the coin, "Quarter Dollar"
*Reverse:
**as before:
***"[[E Pluribus Unum]]"
**instead of on the obverse:
***The four digits of the year of issue

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">{{distinguish|The Old Wives' Tale (play)}}
An '''old wives' tale''' is a supposed truth which is actually spurious or a superstition. It can be said sometimes to be a type of [[urban legend]], said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered [[superstition]], [[folklore]] or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, such as [[pregnancy]], [[puberty]], [[social relations]], [[health]], [[herbalism]] and [[nutrition]].

== Origins ==
In this context, the word ''wife'' means "woman" rather than "married woman". This usage stems from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|{{wt|ang|wif}}}}'' ("woman") and is akin to the [[German language|German]] ''{{linktext|Weib|lang=de}}'' (also meaning "woman"). This sense of the word is still used in [[Modern English]] in constructions such as ''[[midwife]]'' and ''[[fishwife]]''.

Old wives' tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviors, usually of children, or to share knowledge of [[traditional medicine|folk cures]] for ailments ranging from [[toothaches]] to [[dysentery]].

The concept of old wives' tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the [[King James Bible]] was published with the following translation of the [[Apostle Paul]] writing to his young protégé [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], "But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness" ([[I Timothy]] 4:7 [[KJV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Ti&amp;c=4&amp;v=7&amp;t=KJV#7|title=1 Timothy 4:7 (KJV)|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== The oral tradition ===

Old wives' tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or [[coming of age]] easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don't do certain things.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 15 May 2010, Greer, Germaine. "Grandmother's footsteps" http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/15/germaine-greer-old-wives-tales&lt;/ref&gt;

These tales have often been collected by literate men, and turned into written works. Fairy tales by [[Giambattista Basile|Basile]], [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]], and the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]] have their roots in the oral tradition of women. These male writers took the stories from women, with their plucky, clever heroines and heroes, and turned them into [[morality tale]]s for children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, Jack. ''The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood'', Routledge, 1993 {{ISBN|0-415-90834-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of old wives' tales ==

'''Paper craft''' is the collection of [[art]] forms employing [[paper]] or [[card stock|card]] as the primary [[artistic medium]] for the creation of three-dimensional objects.  It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded,  stitched, or layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=6 |title=The Complete Photo Guide to Paper Crafts|first=Patrice |last=Boerens |isbn=978-1-58923-468-0 |publisher=Creative Publishing International |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papermaking]] by hand is also an important paper craft. [[Painting]] and [[calligraphy]] though they are commonly applied as decoration are normally considered as separate arts or crafts.

Paper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caribbean-craft.com/|title=Handmade Home Decor {{!}} Paper Mache {{!}} Caribbean Craft|last=Craft|first=Caribbean|website=www.caribbean-craft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the [[education]] of children.  Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals.&lt;ref name="Therapy"&gt;Carol Tubbs, Margaret Drake, ''Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy'', "Paper crafts", (2006), p. 221-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also neater to work with than paints, dyes, and other coloring materials.  Paper crafts may also be used in [[psychotherapy|therapeutic]] settings, providing children with a safe and uncomplicated creative outlet to express feelings.&lt;ref name="Therapy"/&gt;

==Folded paper==
The word "paper" derives from [[papyrus]], the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in [[Egypt]] as far back as the third millennium B.C.&lt;ref name=Skeat&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat, 1935. "Papyrus and its uses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018121945/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html |date=2013-10-18 }} ([[British Museum]] pamphlet).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the earliest known example of "paper folding" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern [[road]] [[map]].&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers.&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; 

The first Japanese origami is dated from the 6th century A.D.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;Lang, Robert James. [1988] (1988). The Complete Book of Origami: Step-by Step Instructions in Over 1000 Diagrams/48 Original Models. Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-25837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the [[Western world|West]], the term [[origami]] is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Bible"&gt;Nick Robinson, ''The Origami Bible'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi ([[Chinese paper folding]]), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and [[paper plane]]s.

==Cut paper==
{{Main|Papercutting}}
[[Papel picado]], as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while [[Chinese paper cutting]] uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. [[Wycinanki]] and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.

==Paper pulp painting==

Images built using colored paper pulp are a form of paper art that started in the 20th century. [[Chuck Close]], [[Lynn Sures]] are among contemporary artist developing this medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{About||a comparison of parables with other stories|Traditional story|a geometrical figure with a similar name|Parabola}}

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Return of the Prodigal Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Return of the Prodigal Son]], by [[Rembrandt]].]]
A '''parable''' is  a succinct, [[Didacticism|didactic]] story, in [[prose]] or [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] that illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. It differs from a [[fable]] in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference Between Fable and Parable|url=http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-fable-and-vs-parable/|website=DifferenceBetween.com|publisher=Difference Between|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parable is a type of [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSjRcQSE2uQC&amp;pg=PA99 |title=What are they saying about the parables |author=David B. Gowler |year=2000 |work= What are they saying about the parables |pages=99,137,63,132,133, }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars of the [[canonical gospels]] and the [[New Testament]] apply the term "parable" only to the [[parables of Jesus]],&lt;ref name="Die Gleichnisreden Jesu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"&gt;[[John P. Meier]], ''[[A Marginal Jew]]'', volume II, Doubleday, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; though that is not a common restriction of the term. Parables such as "[[Parable of the Prodigal Son|The Prodigal Son]]" are central to Jesus's teaching method in the [[Biblical canon#New Testament|canonical narratives]] and the [[apocrypha]].

==Etymology==
The word ''parable'' comes from the  [[Greek language|Greek]] παραβολή (''parabolē''), meaning "comparison, illustration, analogy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparabolh%2F παραβολή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; It was the name given by Greek [[rhetorician]]s to an illustration in the form of a brief fictional [[narrative]].

==History==
Parables are often used to explore ethical concepts in [[Spirituality|spiritual]] texts. The [[Bible]] contains numerous parables in the [[Gospel]]s section of the [[New Testament]] ([[Parables of Jesus|Jesus's parables]]). These are believed by some scholars (such as [[John P. Meier]]) to have been inspired by [[Mashal (allegory)|mashal]]im, a form of Hebrew comparison.&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"/&gt; Examples of Jesus' parables include the [[Good Samaritan]] and the [[Prodigal Son]]. Mashalim from the [[Old Testament]] include the parable of the ewe-lamb (told by [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] in 2 Samuel 12:1-9&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=289892665 2 Samuel 12:1–9]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the parable of the woman of Tekoah (in 2 Samuel 14:1-13 &lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=2898925961 Samuel 14:1–13]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Parables also appear in [[Islam]].  In [[Sufi]] tradition, parables are used for imparting lessons and values. Recent authors such as [[Idries Shah]] and [[Anthony de Mello]] have helped popularize these stories beyond Sufi circles.

Modern parables also exist.  A mid-19th-century example, the [[Parable of the broken window]], criticises a part of [[Economics|economic]] thinking.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Jan Wijnants - Parable of the Good Samaritan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], by [[Jan Wijnants]] (1670).]]

A parable is a short tale that illustrates a  universal truth; it is a simple [[narrative]]. It sketches a setting, describes an [[Action (philosophy)|action]], and shows the results. It may sometimes be distinguished from  similar narrative types, such as the [[allegory]] and the [[apologue]].&lt;ref name="fowler558"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage |last=Fowler |first=H.W.|year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London|page=558}} See entry at '''simile and metaphor'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A parable often involves a character who faces a [[morality|moral]] dilemma or one who makes a bad decision and then suffers the [[unintended consequences]]. Although the meaning of a parable is often not explicitly stated, it is not intended to be hidden or secret but to be quite straightforward and obvious.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Fyler Townsend]], in his translator's preface to ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' (Belford, Clarke &amp; Co., 1887), defined the parable as being "purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words themselves, and which may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer or reader." However, Townsend may have been influenced by the 19th century expression, "to speak in parables", connoting obscurity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristic of the parable is the presence of a [[subtext]] suggesting how a person should behave or what he should believe. Aside from providing guidance and suggestions for proper conduct in one's life, parables frequently use [[metaphor]]ical language which allows people to more easily discuss difficult or complex ideas. Parables express an [[Abstract and concrete|abstract argument]] by means of using a concrete narrative which is easily understood.

The allegory is a more general narrative type; it also employs [[metaphor]]. Like the parable, the allegory makes a single, unambiguous point. An allegory may have multiple noncontradictory interpretations and may also have implications that are ambiguous or hard to interpret. As [[H.W. Fowler]] put it, the object of both parable and allegory "is to enlighten the hearer by submitting to him a case in which he has apparently no direct concern, and upon which therefore a disinterested judgment may be elicited from him, ..."&lt;ref name="fowler558"/&gt; The parable is more condensed than the allegory: it rests upon a single [[principle]] and a single moral, and it is intended that the reader or listener shall conclude that the moral applies equally well to his own concerns.

===Jesus' parables===
{{Main article|Parables of Jesus}}
[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] interpreters of the Bible often treated [[Jesus]]' parables as allegories, with symbolic [[correspondence (theology)|correspondence]]s found for every element in his parables. But modern scholars, beginning with [[Adolf Jülicher]], regard their interpretations as incorrect.&lt;ref name="Die Gleichnisreden Jesu"&gt;Adolf Jülicher, ''Die Gleichnisreden Jesu'' (2 vols; Tübingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1888, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; Jülicher held that Jesus' parables are intended to make a single important point, and most recent scholarship agrees.&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"/&gt;

[[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] suggested that Jesus kept some of his teachings secret within the circle of his disciples and that he deliberately obscured their meaning by using parables. For example, in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark 4:11–12]]:

{{Quotation|And he said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the [[kingdom of God]], but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that ‘they may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be [[Forgiveness|forgiven]].’” ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]])}}

===Other figures of speech===
The parable is related to [[Figure of speech|figures of speech]] such as the metaphor and the simile, but it should not be identified with them.

A parable is  like a metaphor in that it uses concrete, perceptible phenomena to illustrate abstract ideas. It may be said that a parable is a metaphor that has been extended to form a brief, coherent narrative.

A parable also resembles a [[simile]], i.e., a metaphorical construction in which something is said to be "like" something else (e.g., "The just man is like a tree planted by streams of water"). However, unlike the meaning of a simile, a parable's meaning is implicit (although not secret).

{{Redirect|Patron||Patron (disambiguation)}}

'''Patronage''' is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another. In the history of art, '''arts patronage''' refers to the support that kings, popes, and the wealthy have provided to artists such as musicians, painters, and sculptors. It can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or [[Benefice|church benefices]], the business given to a store by a regular customer, and the [[patron saint|guardianship of saints]]. The word "patron" derives from the {{lang-la|patronus}} ("patron"), one who gives benefits to his clients (see [[Patronage in ancient Rome]]).

In some countries the term is used to describe '''political patronage''', which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support. Some patronage systems are legal, as in the Canadian tradition of the Prime Minister to appoint [[Senate of Canada|senators]] and the heads of a number of commissions and agencies; in many cases, these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the Prime Minister. As well, the term may refer to a type of [[Political corruption|corruption]] or favoritism in which a party in power rewards groups, families, ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent study of political patronage in the People's Republic of China, see Hillman, Ben. [http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=18534 ''Patronage and Power: Local State Networks and Party-state Resilience in Rural China''] [[Stanford University Press]], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==

From the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] onward, patronage of the [[arts]] was important in [[art history]]. It is known in greatest detail in reference to [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] Europe, though patronage can also be traced in [[History of Japan|feudal Japan]], the traditional [[Southeast Asia]]n kingdoms, and elsewhere—art patronage tended to arise wherever a [[royal family|royal]] or [[Empire|imperial]] system and an [[aristocracy]] dominated a society and controlled a significant share of resources. [[Samuel Johnson]] defined a patron as "one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michael Rosenthal, ''Constable'', London: Thames and  Hudson, 1987, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rulers, nobles and very wealthy people used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions, social positions, and prestige. That is, patrons operated as [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]s. Most languages other than English still use the term ''mecenate'', derived from the name of [[Gaius Maecenas]], generous friend and adviser to the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Some patrons, such as the [[Medici]] of [[Florence]], used artistic patronage to "cleanse" wealth that was perceived as ill-gotten through [[usury]]. Art patronage was especially important in the creation of [[religious art]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] and later [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups sponsored art and [[architecture]], as seen in [[Church (building)|churches]], [[cathedral]]s, [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[handicraft]]s.

While sponsorship of artists and the [[commission (art)|commissioning]] of artwork is the best-known aspect of the patronage system, other disciplines also benefited from patronage, including those who studied [[natural philosophy]] ([[History of science|pre-modern]] [[science]]), [[music]]ians, [[literature|writers]], [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[alchemy|alchemists]], [[astrology|astrologers]], and other [[scholar]]s. Artists as diverse and important as [[Chrétien de Troyes]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Ben Jonson]] all sought and enjoyed the support of noble or ecclesiastical patrons.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Kent et al., eds.,''Patronage, Art, and Society in Renaissance Italy,'' Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cedric C. Brown, ''Patronage, Politics, and Literary traditions in England, 1558–1658,'' Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures as late as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] also participated in the system to some degree; it was only with the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the middle 19th century that European culture moved away from its patronage system to the more publicly supported system of museums, theaters, mass audiences and mass consumption that is familiar in the contemporary world.    
  
This kind of system continues across many fields of the [[arts]]. Though the nature of the sponsors has changed—from churches to charitable foundations, and from aristocrats to plutocrats—the term ''patronage'' has a more neutral [[connotation]] than in politics. It may simply refer to direct support (often financial) of an artist, for example by [[Grant (money)|grants]]. In the latter part of the 20th century, the academic sub-discipline of patronage studies began to evolve, in recognition of the important and often neglected role that the phenomenon of patronage had played in the cultural life of previous centuries.

==Charity==
Charitable and other non-profit making organisations often seek an influential figurehead to act as patron. The relationship often does not involve money. As well as conferring credibility, these people can use their contacts and charisma to assist the organisation to raise funds or to affect government policy.  The [[British Royal Family]] are especially prolific in this respect, devoting a large proportion of their time to a wide range of causes.&lt;ref name="Royal Patronage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/CharitiesandPatronages/Suggesting%20a%20Patronage/Suggesting%20a%20Patronage.aspx|title=British Monarchy website, London.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Custom]] --&gt;
Sometimes consumers support smaller or local businesses or corporations out of loyalty even if less expensive options exist. Their regular custom is referred to as 'patronage'.  Patronage may entitle members of a [[cooperative]] to a share of the surplus or profit generated by the co-op, called a ''[[patronage refund]]''.  This refund is a form of [[dividend]].

==Ecclesiastical==
===Anglican===
:''See main article [[Parish#England|Parish]]''
In the [[Church of England]], ''patronage'' is the commonly used term for the right to present a candidate to a benefice.

===Catholic===

====Patronage of Our Lady====
The [[liturgical feast]] of the Patronage of Our Lady was first permitted by [[decree (canon law)|Decree]] of the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] on 6 May 1679, for all the ecclesiastical provinces of [[Spain]], in memory of the victories obtained over the Saracens, heretics and other enemies from the sixth century to the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Pope [[Benedict XII]] ordered it to be kept in the [[Papal States]] on the third Sunday of November. To other places it is granted, on request, for some Sunday in November, to be designated by the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]. In many places the feast of the Patronage is held with an additional Marian title of '''Queen of All Saints, of Mercy, Mother of Graces'''. The Office is taken entirely from the Common of the Blessed Virgin, and the Mass is the "Salve sancta parens".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11560b.htm Mershman, Francis. "Feast of the Patronage of Our Lady." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 11 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presbyterian===
The [[Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711]], (in force until 1874) resulted in multiple [[First Secession|secessions]] from the [[Church of Scotland]], including the [[First Secession|secession of 1733]], which led to the formation of the Associate Presbytery, the [[Second Secession|secession of 1761]], which led to the formation of the [[Relief Church]], and the [[Disruption of 1843]], which led to the formation of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

==Journalism==
While most news companies, particularly in North America are funded through [[advertising]] revenue,&lt;ref name="Silicon Valley Watcher"&gt;{{cite web| title =Pew: Impact Of Billionaire Funded Journalism Is Tiny| url =http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2014/03/pew_impact_of_billion.php|website=Silicon Valley Watcher|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; secondary funding sources include audience members and philanthropists who donate to for-profit and non-profit organizations.

==Politics==
[[Political leader]]s have at their disposal a great deal of patronage, in the sense that they make decisions on the appointment of [[official]]s inside and outside government (for example on [[quango]]s in the UK). Patronage is therefore a recognized  power of the [[executive (government)|executive branch]]. In most countries the executive has the right to make many appointments, some of which may be lucrative (see also [[sinecure]]s). In some [[Democracy|democracies]], high-level appointments are reviewed or approved by the [[legislature]] (as in the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]]); in other countries, such as those using the [[Westminster system]], this is not the case. Other types of political patronage may violate the laws or ethics codes, such as when political leaders engage in [[nepotism]] (hiring family members) and [[cronyism]] such as fraudulently awarding non-competitive government contracts to friends or relatives or pressuring the public service to hire an unqualified family member or friend.

===Philippines===

Political patronage, also known as "''[[Padrino System]]''" also a slang call as ''balimbing'' ([[carambola|starfruit]]), in the Philippines, has been the source of many controversies and corruption.  It has been an [[open secret]] that one cannot join the [[Politics of the Philippines|political arena of the Philippines]] without mastery of the Padrino System. From the lowest [[Barangay]] official, to the [[President of the Philippines|President of the Republic]], it is expected that one gains political debts and dispenses political favor to advance one's career or gain influence, if not wealth.

===Russia===
After [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s retirement from politics in March 1923 following a stroke, a power struggle began between [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Pravda]] editor [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Profintern]] leader [[Mikhail Tomsky]], [[Red Army]] founder [[Leon Trotsky]], former Premier [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Comintern]] leader [[Grigory Zinoviev]], and [[General Secretary of the CPSU|General Secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]. Stalin used patronage to appoint many Stalinist delegates (such as [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Grigory Ordzhonikidze]], and [[Mikhail Kalinin]]) to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] [[Politburo of the CPSU|Politburo]] and [[Sovnarkom]] in order to sway the votes in his favour, making Stalin the effective leader of the country by 1929.

===South Africa===
During 2012, the African National Congress (ANC) mayor of Beaufort West in the Western Cape Province wrote a letter which openly and illegally solicited funds from the Construction Education and Training Authority for the ANC's 2016 election campaign. This episode, amongst many others including instances revolving around president Jacob Zuma, revealed how the African National Congress as ruling political party utilized patronage to reward supporters and strengthen the leading faction of the party's control over governmental institutions.&lt;ref name="dailymaveric"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-02-02-analysis-power-patronage-and-gatekeeper-politics-in-the-time-of-truman-prince/#.VrGtyctf0iQ |title=Power, patronage and gatekeeper politics in the time of Truman Prince|newspaper=Daily Maverick|location= Johannesburg|date= 3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Spoils system}}
In the [[United States]] during the [[Gilded Age]], patronage became a controversial issue. [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] boss [[William M. Tweed]] was an American politician who ran what is considered now to have been one of the most corrupt political machines in the country's history. Tweed and his cronies ruled for a brief time with absolute power over the city and state of New York. At the height of his influence, Tweed was the third-largest landowner in [[New York City]], a director of the [[Erie Railway]], the [[Tenth National Bank]], and the New-York Printing Company, as well as proprietor of the [[Metropolitan Hotel (New York City)|Metropolitan Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Boss Tweed |last=Ackerman |first=Kenneth D. |year=2005 |publisher=Carrol &amp; Graf Publishers |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7867-1686-9 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nzMoAc-iew0C&amp;dq=boss+tweed&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times he was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], the New York City Board of Advisors, and the [[New York State Senate]]. In 1873, Tweed was convicted for diverting between $40 million and $200 million of public monies.&lt;ref name="gotham"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20050704/202/1467 |title=Boss Tweed |newspaper=Gotham Gazette |location=New York |date=4 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427090825/http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20030602/4/408 |archivedate=2007-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after [[James Garfield]] became [[President of the United States|president]] in 1881,  [[Charles J. Guiteau]], a disappointed office-seeker, assassinated him. To prevent further political violence and to assuage public outrage, Congress passed the [[Pendleton Act]] in 1883, which set up the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]]. Henceforth, applicants for most federal government jobs would have to pass an examination. Federal politicians' influence over bureaucratic appointments waned, and patronage declined as a national political issue.

Beginning in 1969, a Supreme Court case in Chicago, [[Michael L. Shakman v. Democratic Organization of Cook County]], occurred involving political patronage and its constitutionality.  Shakman claimed that much of the patronage going on in Chicago politics was unlawful on the grounds of the first and fourteenth amendments.  Through a series of legal battle and negotiations, the two parties agreed upon [[Shakman Decrees|The Shakman Decrees]].  Under these decrees it was declared that the employment status of most public employees could not be affected positively or negatively based on political allegiance, with exceptions for politically inclined positions.  The case is still in negotiation today, as there are points yet to be decided.&lt;ref name=chic&gt;{{cite web| title =Shakman Decrees| website=Encyclopedia of Chicago| url =http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1138.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite web| title =The Shakman Decrees| website =Cook FP Shakman| url =http://www.cookfpshakman.com/background.html| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130826024721/http://cookfpshakman.com/background.html| archivedate =2013-08-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leagle&gt;{{cite web| title =SHAKMAN v. DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION OF COOK CTY| website=Leagle| url =http://www.leagle.com/decision/19791796481FSupp1315_11605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political patronage is not always considered corrupt. In the United States, the U.S. Constitution provides the president with the power to appoint individuals to government positions. He or she also may appoint personal advisers without congressional approval. Not surprisingly, these individuals tend to be supporters of the president. Similarly, at the state and local levels, governors and mayors retain appointments powers. Some scholars have argued that patronage may be used for laudable purposes, such as the "recognition" of minority communities through the appointment of their members to a high-profile positions. Bearfield has argued that patronage be used for four general purposes: create or strengthen a political organization; achieve democratic or egalitarian goals; bridge political divisions and create coalitions; and to alter the existing patronage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Science==
There are historical examples where the noble classes financed scientific pursuits.

Many [[Barmakids]] were patrons of the sciences, which greatly helped the propagation of Indian science and scholarship from the neighbouring [[Academy of Gundishapur]] into the Arabic world. They patronized scholars such as [[Gebir]] and [[Jabril ibn Bukhtishu]]. They are also credited with the establishment of the first [[paper mill]] in Baghdad. The power of the Barmakids in those times is reflected in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''; the vizier Ja'far appears in several stories, as well as a tale that gave rise to the expression "Barmecide feast".

{{quote|We know of Yahya b Khalid al Barmaki (805) as a patron of physicians and, specifically, of the translation of Hindu medical works into both Arabic and Persian. In all likelihood however, his activity took place in the orbit of the caliphal court in Iraq, where at the behest of Harun al Rashid (786 -809), such books were translated into Arabic. Thus Khurasan and Transoxania were effectively bypassed in this transfer of learning from India to Islam, even though, undeniably the Barmakis cultural outlook owed something to their land of origin, northern Afghanistan, and Yahya al Barmaki's interest in medicine may have derived from no longer identifiable family tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia|volume=4, Part 2 |authors=Bosworth, C. E. Bosworth&amp; Asimov, M.S.| page =300}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sports==
In the same manner as commercial patronage, those who attend a sporting event may be referred to as patrons, though the usage in much of the world is now considered archaic—with some notable exceptions.  Those who attend the [[Masters Tournament]], one of the four major championship of professional [[golf]], are still traditionally referred to as "patrons," largely at the insistence of the [[Augusta National Golf Club]]. This insistence is occasionally made fun of by [[sportswriter]]s and other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golf.com/golf/tours_news/article/0,28136,1607332,00.html Davis, Seth: The difference between patrons and fans, Golf.com, April 6 2007.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015081922/http://www.golf.com/golf/tours_news/article/0%2C28136%2C1607332%2C00.html |date=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[polo]], a "patron" is a person who puts together a team by hiring one or more professionals. The rest of the team may be amateurs, often including the patron himself (or, increasingly, herself).

Also, people who attend [[hurling]] or [[Gaelic football]] games organised by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] are referred to as patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The high visibility of the star cluster [[Pleiades]] in the [[night sky]] has guaranteed it a special place in many cultures, both ancient and modern. The [[heliacal rising]] of Pleiades often marks important calendar points for ancient peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Brad Schaefer (Yale University). ''Heliacal Rising: Definitions, Calculations, and some Specific Cases'' (''Essays'' from Archaeoastronomy &amp; Ethnoastronomy News, the Quarterly Bulletin of the Center for Archaeoastronomy, Number 25.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== North Africa ==

=== Berber people ===
The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg Berbers]] living in the desert of North Africa call the Pleiades '''Cat iheḍ''' (pronounced: ''shat ihedd''), or '''Cat ahăḍ''' (pronounced: ''shat ahadd''). The name means in [[Berber language|Berber]]: "daughters of the night". Other Berbers call this star cluster: '''Amanar''' (meaning: "the guide") or '''Tagemmunt''' (meaning: "the group").{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A Tuareg Berber proverb says:

''Cat ahăḍ as uḍănăt, ttukayeɣ ttegmyeɣ, anwar daɣ ttsasseɣ. As d-gmaḍent, ttukayeɣ ttegmyeɣ tabruq ttelseɣ.''

Translation: When the Pleiades fall, I wake up looking for my goatskin bag to drink. When (the Pleiades) rise, I wake up looking for a cloth to wear.

Meaning: When the Pleiades "fall" with the sun on the west, it means the hot season is coming, which implies the heat and the thirst of the summer. When the Pleiades rise from the east with the sun, it means the cold and rainy season is coming, and thus one does well to prepare for the cold.&lt;ref&gt;Étoiles et constellations chez les nomades, Edmond Bernus &amp; Ehya ag-Sidiyene, Awal magazine, 1989, Édition de la maison des sciences de l'homme, Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_20-21/27329.pdf Étoiles et constellations chez les nomades, Edmond Bernus &amp; Ehya ag-Sidiyene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6btoFb1gzwsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Essai sur les origines des Touaregs]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle East ==

=== Bible ===

In the [[Bible]], the Pleiades are mentioned as כימה ("Khima") three times, always in conjunction with [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]—Amos 5:8; Job 9:9; and Job 38:31. The first two verses are references about their creation, but the third (taken in the context of the following verses) may be more about their ongoing appearance in the night sky. In Job 38:31, the Lord is speaking directly to Job and challenges him, asking if he can bind the chains of the Pleiades—the implication being that Job cannot, but the Lord can. [[Talmud]] ([http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8:%D7%91%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%A3_%D7%A0%D7%97 Bavli, Berakhot, 58b]) says that it has about 100 stars, understanding the word כימה as כמאה ''ke' me-ah,'' "about one hundred" in Hebrew.

They are known as [[Biblical cosmology|kimah]] in Jewish culture.

Like most other astronomical findings in the Talmud, rabbinic tradition claims to have gotten such knowledge from Moses when he descended down from [[Mount Sinai]], and hence, from God Himself.

Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki ("[[Rashi]]", 1040-1105), suggested that there were even more stars within the Pleiades Cluster when he expanded on the Talmud's question, "What is meant by Kimah?” which is understood by the modern Orthodox community to mean that there are more than a hundred stars. Therefore, Rashi was saying that the passage in the Talmud only mentioned the most important stars, this numbering to about a hundred, while leaving out the less important ones (which could be hundreds more).

Amazingly, the [[Pleiades]] are at max, 500 light years away, and here were the rabbis, commenting on the number of stars where other cultures could only detect 6-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hidabrut.com/article/171581/The-Pleiades-Star-Cluster|title=The Pleiades Star Cluster|access-date=2017-05-21|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabia and the Levant ===

In [[Arabic]] the Pleiades are known as ''al-Thurayya'' الثريا, and mentioned in Islamic literature. Muhammad is noted to have counted twelve stars in the constellation as reported in [[Ibn Ishaq]] (this was in the time before telescopes when most could only see six).
The name was borrowed into [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as a female given name, and is in use throughout the [[Middle East]] (for example [[Princess Soraya of Iran]] and [[Thoraya Obaid]]). It is also the name of the [[Thuraya]] satellite phone system based in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

[[Muhammad]] made mention of the [[Pleiades]]. A [[Hadith]] recalled by Imam [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], states:

{{quote|A companion of The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) relates: One day we were sitting with The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when this chapter*&lt;ref name="alislam.org"&gt;http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=1135&amp;region=EN&lt;/ref&gt; was revealed. I enquired from Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Who are the people to whom the words "and among others of them who have not yet joined them"** refer? Salman (may Allah be pleased with him), a Persian was sitting among us. The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put his hand on Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) and said. If faith were to go up to the Pleiades, a man from among these would surely find it. ([[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/topics/messiah/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''*The chapter talked about above is Chapter 62&lt;ref name="alislam.org"/&gt; - Surah Al-Jummah&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=1136&amp;region=EN&lt;/ref&gt; - from the [[Qur'an]].''

''**The verse quoted here is verse 3 from the aforementioned chapter.''

=== Turkey ===

In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] the Pleiades are known as ''Ülker''. According to the [[Middle Turkic]] lexicographer [[Kaşgarlı Mahmud]], writing in the 11th century, ''ülker çerig'' refers to a military [[ambush]] (''çerig'' meaning 'troops in battle formation'): "The army is broken up into detachments posted in various places," and when one detachment falls back the others follow after it, and by this device "(the enemy) is often routed." Thus ''ülker çerig'' literally means 'an army made up of a group of detachments', which forms an apt [[simile]] for a star cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clauson|first=Gerard|title=An Etymological Dictionary of Pre-Thirteenth-Century Turkish|date=1972|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=143|authorlink=Gerard Clauson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ülker is also a unisex given name, a surname and the name of [[Ülker|a food company]] best known for its chocolates.

=== Iran ===

In the [[Persian language]] Pleiades is known as ''Parvin''. Parvin is also a very popular given name in [[Iran]] and neighbouring countries (for example [[Parvin E'tesami]]).

== Europe ==

The word has acquired a meaning of "multitude", inspiring the name of the French literary movement [[La Pléiade]] and an earlier group of [[Alexandria]]n poets, the [[Alexandrian Pleiad]].

=== Greek mythology ===

{{main article|Pleiades (Greek mythology)}}

In [[Greek mythology]], the stars of Pleiades represented the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Seven Sisters]].

=== Norse mythology ===

To the [[Viking]]s, the Pleiades were [[Freyja]]'s hens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rediscovering Vinland : evidence of ancient Viking presence in America|date=2007|publisher=iUniverse|location=New York|isbn=0595436803|pages=128|author=Fred N. Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their name in many old European languages such as Hungarian compares them to a hen with chicks.

=== Western astrology ===
[[File:Pleiades (Agrippa 1531).svg|thumb|Kabbalistic "[[Pleiades]]" symbol from ''Libri tres de occulta philosophia'' (1531) by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]].]]
The [[astrological]] Pleiades were described in ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'' by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (Köln, 1533, but published manuscript as early as 1510).

In [[Western astrology]] they represent coping with sorrow&lt;ref&gt;Morse, Eric (1988). ''The Living Stars''. London: Amethyst Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and were considered a single one of the [[medieval]] [[Behenian fixed stars|fixed stars]]. As such, they are associated with [[quartz]] and [[fennel]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In [[esoteric astrology]] the seven solar systems revolve around Pleiades.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice (1934). ''Esoteric Astrology''. New York: Lucis Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celtic mythology ===

[[File:Nebra Scheibe.jpg|thumb|right|A bronze disk, 1600 BC, from Nebra, Germany, is one of the oldest known representations of the cosmos. The Pleiades are top right. See [[Nebra sky disk]]]]
To the [[Bronze Age]] people of Europe, such as the [[Celts]] (and probably considerably earlier), the Pleiades were associated with mourning and with funerals, since at that time in history, on the [[cross-quarter day]] {{Dubious|date=October 2011}} between the [[autumn equinox]] and the [[winter solstice]] (see [[Samhain]], also [[Halloween]] or [[All Souls Day]]), which was a festival devoted to the remembrance of the dead, the cluster rose in the eastern sky as the sun's light faded in the evening. It was from this [[heliacal rising|acronychal rising]] that the Pleiades became associated with tears and mourning. As a result of [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] over the centuries, the Pleiades no longer marked the festival, but the association has nevertheless persisted, and may account for the significance of the Pleiades astrologically.

=== Baltic mythology ===

In [[Baltic languages]] the name for this constellation is '''Sietynas''' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and '''Sietiņš''' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] which is derived from ''sietas'' meaning "[[sieve|a sieve]]". In Lithuanian folk songs this constellation is often [[personification|personified]] as a benevolent brother who helps orphan girls to marry or walks soldiers along the fields. But in Lithuanian folk tales as well as Latvian folk songs this constellation is usually depicted as an inanimate object, a sieve which gets stolen by the devil from the thunder god or is used to conjure light rain by thunder's wife and children.&lt;ref&gt;http://tautosmenta.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Laurinkiene_Nijole/Laurinkiene_LK_2002_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukrainian folklore ===

In [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] traditional folklore the Pleiades are known as Стожари (Stozhary), Волосожари (Volosozhary), or Баби-Звізди (Baby-Zvizdy).

'Stozhary' can be etymologically traced to "стожарня" (stozharnya) meaning a 'granary', 'storehouse for hay and crops', or can also be reduced to the root "сто-жар", (sto-zhar) meaning 'hundredfold glowing' or "a hundred embers".&lt;ref&gt;The Comprehensive Dictionary of the Contemporary Ukrainian Language. Perun Publishers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Volosozhary' (the ones whose hair is glowing), or 'Baby-Zvizdy' (female-stars) refer to the female tribal deities. According to the legend, seven maids lived long ago. They used to dance the traditional round dances and sing the glorious songs to honor the gods. After their death the gods turned them into water nymphs, and, having taken them to the Heavens, settled them upon the seven stars, where they dance their round dances (symbolic for moving the time) to this day. (see article in Ukrainian Wikipedia)

In [[Ukraine]] this asterism was considered a female talisman until recent times.

=== Hungarian folklore ===

The old name of the starcluster in Hungarian is "Fiastyúk", meaning 'a hen with chicks'. There is also a version of the story popularized by the song "A Nap és Szép háza" (House of Sun and Wind) of Hungarian folk metal band Dalriada speaking of a poor woman with seven sons who cursed her sons to turn into ravens after the sons wasted their only food. She failed to find them, but received a prophecy that an eighth brother could find the sons. Her eighth son thus went to look for his brothers, died and the brothers as ravens came to feast on his carcass, resulting in them dying as well and the eight of them getting a place in the sky as the Pleiades cluster. 

== Indigenous peoples of the Americas ==
(Alphabetical by people)

It was common among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] to measure keenness of [[visual perception|vision]] by the number of stars the viewer could see in the Pleiades, a practice which was also used in historical [[Europe]], especially in [[Greece]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Andean cultures ===

In the ancient [[Andes]], the Pleiades were associated with abundance, because they return to the [[Southern Hemisphere]] sky each year at harvest-time. In [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] they are called ''Qullqa'' (storehouse).

=== Aztec ===

The ancient [[Aztec]]s of Mexico and Central America based their calendar upon the Pleiades. Their year began when priests first remarked the asterism heliacal rising in the east, immediately before the sun's dawn light obliterated the view of the stars. Aztecs called the Pleiades [[Tianquiztli]] (meaning "marketplace").

=== Blackfoot ===

[[Paul Goble]], Native American storyteller, tells a [[Blackfoot]] legend that he says is told by other tribes as well. In the story, the Pleiades are orphans ("Lost Boys") that were not cared for by the people, so they became stars. Sun Man is angered by the mistreatment of the children and punishes the people with a draught, causing the buffalo to disappear, until the dogs, the only friends of the orphans, intercede on behalf of the people. Because the buffalo are not available while the Lost Boys are in the skies, the cosmical setting of the Pleaides was an assembly signal for Blackfoot hunter to travel to their hunting grounds to conduct the large-scale hunts, culminating in slaughters at buffalo jumps, that characterized their culture.

=== Cherokee ===

A [[Cherokee]] myth (similar to that of the [[Onondaga people]]) indicates that seven boys who would not do their ceremonial chores and wanted only to play, ran around and around the ceremonial ball court in a circle, and rose up into the sky. Only six of the boys made it to the sky; the seventh was caught by his mother and fell to the ground with such force that he sank into the ground. A pine tree grew over his resting place.&lt;ref name="Kingsolver, Barbara 1993 90–91"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kingsolver, Barbara|author-link=Barbara Kingsolver|title=[[Pigs in Heaven]]|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=1993|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cheyenne ===

A [[Cheyenne]] myth "The Girl Who Married a Dog", states that the group of seven stars known as the [[Pleiades]] originated from seven puppies which a Cheyenne chief's daughter gave birth to after mysteriously being visited by a dog in human form to whom she vowed "Wherever you go, I go".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/cheyennestory3.htm The Girl Who Married A Dog]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hopi ===

The [[Hopi]] had a relatively limited star lore, but determined the passage of time for nighttime rituals in the winter by observing the Pleiades (''Tsöösöqam'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hopi Dictionary Project (University of Arizona Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology)|date=1998|title=Hopi dictionary: Hopìikwa Lavàytutuveni: A Hopi-English Dictionary of the Third Mesa Dialect with an English-Hopi Finder List and a Sketch of Hopi Grammar|location=Tucson, Arizona|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=0-8165-1789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Orion through a [[kiva]] entrance hatch as they passed overhead. The Pleiades were depicted in a mural on one kiva wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stephen | first = Alexander M. | editor-last = Parsons | editor-first = Elsie Clews | editor-link = Elsie Clews Parsons | title = Hopi Journal of Alexander M.

=== Lakota ===

The [[Lakota people|Lakota Tribe]] of [[North America]] had a legend that linked the origin of the Pleiades to [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]]. According to the [[Seri people|Seris]] (of northwestern Mexico), these stars are seven women who are giving birth. The constellation is known as ''Cmaamc'', which is apparently an archaic plural of the noun ''cmaam'' "woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Mary B. |author2=Stephen A.

=== Mono ===

The [[Mono people|Monache people]] tell of six wives who loved onions more than their husbands and now live happily in "sky country".&lt;ref name="They Dance" /&gt;

=== Monte Alto Culture ===

The early [[Monte Alto Culture]], and others in [[Guatemala]] such as [[Ujuxte]] and [[Takalik Abaj]], made their early observatories using the Pleiades and ''Eta Draconis'' as reference; they were called ''the seven sisters'', and thought to be their original land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_astronomy.htm Maya Astronomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nez Perce ===

A [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] myth about this constellation mirrors the ancient Greek myths about the [[Electra (Pleiad)|Lost Pleiades]]. In the Nez Perce version the Pleiades is also a group of sisters, however the story itself is somewhat different. One sister falls in love with a man and, following his death, is so absorbed by her own grief that she tells her sisters about him. They mock her and tell her how silly it is of her to feel sad for the human after his death, and she in return keeps her growing sadness to herself, eventually becoming so ashamed and miserable about her own feelings that she pulls the sky over her face like a veil, blocking herself from view. This myth explains why there are only six of the seven stars visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Clark| first = Ella| title = Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest| publisher = University of California Press| date = 1953| location = Berkeley and Los Angeles, California| pages = 155–156| isbn = 0-520-00243-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navajo ===

The Pleiades (''dilγéhé'') play a major role in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] folklore and ritual. In the Navajo creation story, Upward-reachingway, ''dilγéhé'' was the first constellation placed in the sky by Black God. When Black God entered the [[hogan]] of creation, the Pleiades were on his ankle; he stamped his foot and they moved to his knee, then to his ankle, then to his shoulder, and finally to his left temple. The seven stars of ''dilγéhé'' are depicted on ceremonial masks of Black God, in sand paintings and on ceremonial gourd rattles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Haile | first = Berard | author-link = Berard Haile | title = Starlore Among the Navaho | place =  Santa Fe, NM | publisher = William Gannon | origyear = 1947 | date = 1977 | page =  | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Onondaga ===

The [[Onondaga people]]'s version of the story has lazy children who prefer to dance over their daily chores ignoring the warnings of the Bright Shining Old Man.&lt;ref name="They Dance" /&gt;

=== Pawnee ===

The [[Skidi]] [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] consider the Pleiades to be seven brothers. They observed the seven brothers, as well as Corona Borealis, the Chiefs, through the smoke hole of Pawnee lodges to determine the time of night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Chamberlain | first = Von Del | title = When Stars Came Down to Earth: Cosmology of the Skidi Pawnee Indians of North America | place = Los Altos, CA / College Park, MD | publisher = Ballena Press / Center for Archaeoastronomy | series = Ballena Press Anthropological Papers | volume = 26 | date = 1982 | pages = 166–7, 175–7, 226–7 | url = | isbn = 0-87919-098-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shasta ===

The [[Shasta people]] tell a story of the children of racoon killed by coyote avenging their father's death and then rising into the sky to form the Pleiades. The smallest star in the cluster is said to be coyote's youngest who aided the young racoons.&lt;ref name="They Dance"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monroe|first=[compiled by] Jean Guard|title=They dance in the sky : Native American star myths|date=1987|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0-395-39970-X|pages=1–14|author2=Stewart, Ray A. Williamson  |author3=illustrations by Edgar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia ==

=== Ban Raji mythology ===
Among the [[Ban Raji]] people, who live in semi-nomadic settlements scattered throughout western Nepal and northern India, the Pleiades are called the "Seven sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law" (''Hatai halyou daa salla''). Ban Rajis note that when the Pleiades rises up over the mountain each night, they feel happy to see their ancient kin (Fortier 2008: in press). On a more practical note, Ban Rajis can tell that evening has arrived, indicating that it is about eight o'clock by local time standards when their star-kin rise above the Nepali mountains bordering the Kali River.

=== China ===
In [[Chinese constellation]]s they are 昴 ''mao'', the ''[[Hairy Head (Chinese constellation)|Hairy Head]]'' of the white tiger of the West.

=== India ===
In [[Jyotisha|Indian astrology]] the Pleiades were known as the [[nakshatra]] {{IAST|[[Kṛttikā]]}} which in [[Sanskrit]] is translated as "the cutters".&lt;ref&gt;Dennis M. Harness.  ''The Nakshatras:  The Lunar Mansions of Vedic Astrology.''  Lotus Press (Twin Lakes WI, 1999.) {{ISBN|978-0-914955-83-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pleiades are called the ''star of fire,'' and their ruling deity is the fire god [[Agni]]. It is one of the most prominent of the nakshatra, and is associated with anger and stubbornness. Karthigai (கார்த்திகை) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] refers to the six wives of the six [[rishi]] (sages), the seventh being [[Arundhati (Hinduism)|Arundhati]] the wife of [[Vasistha]] which relates to the star [[Mizar and Alcor|Alcor]] in [[Ursa Major]]. The six stars in Pleiades correspond to six wives, while the faithful wife Arundhati stuck with Sage Vasistha in [[Ursa Major]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tamilandvedas.com/2014/06/25/chastest-woman-arundhati-in-literature/&lt;/ref&gt; The six wives fell in love with [[Agni]], hence the name Pleiades (star of fire).

=== Indonesia ===
In the island of [[Java]], the asterism is known in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''Lintang Kartika'' or ''Gugus Kartika'' ("[[Kṛttikā|Kartika]] cluster"), a direct influence from the ancient [[Hinduism in Java|Hindu Javanese]]. Influenced by Hinduism, the stars represent the seven princesses, which is represented in the court dance of [[Bedhaya|Bedhaya Ketawang]] of the royal palaces of [[Surakarta]]. The dance is performed once per year, on the second day of the Javanese month of [[Javanese calendar|Ruwah]] (during May) and is performed by the nine females, relatives or wives of the [[Susuhunan]] (prince) of Surakarta before a private audience in the inner circle of the Sultanate family.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Judith. ''Gamelan Stories: Tantrism, Islam, and Aesthetics in Central Java''. Arizona State University Program for Southeast Asian Studies, 1993. {{ISBN|1-881044-06-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another name for Pleiades in Java is ''Wuluh''.&lt;ref name="langitselatan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://langitselatan.com/2011/01/02/jejak-langkah-astronomi-di-indonesia/ |title=Jejak Langkah Astronomi di Indonesia |trans-title=Footsteps of Astronomy in Indonesia |author=Avivah Yamani |date=January 2, 2011 |website=Langit Selatan |language=Indonesian |publisher=Langit Selatan |access-date=January 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131075341/http://langitselatan.com/2011/01/02/jejak-langkah-astronomi-di-indonesia/ |archive-date=January 31, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], the Pleiades are known as 昴 ''[[Pleiades|Subaru]]'' which means "coming together" or cluster in Japanese, and have given their name to the [[Subaru|car manufacturer]] whose logo incorporates six stars to represent the five companies that merged into one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subaru.com/faq.html Subaru of America, Inc.

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]] the Pleiades are known as {{RTGS|Dao Luk Kai}} (ดาวลูกไก่) or the "Chick Stars", from a [[Thai folklore|Thai folk tale]]. The story tells that a poor elderly couple who lived in a forest had raised a family of [[chicken]]s: a mother hen and her six (or alternately seven) chicks. One day a monk arrived at the couple's home during his [[Dhutanga]] journey. Worried that they had no suitable food to offer him, the elderly couple contemplated cooking the mother hen. The hen overheard the conversation, and rushed back to the [[Chicken coop|coop]] to say farewell to her children. She told them to take care of themselves, and that her death would repay the kindness of the elderly couple, who had taken care of all of them for so long. As the mother hen's feathers were being burned over a fire, the chicks threw themselves into fire in order to die along with their mother. The deity, impressed by and in remembrance of their love, immortalized the seven chickens as the stars of the Pleiades. In tellings of the story in which there were only six chicks, the mother is included, but often includes only the seven chicks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prapayneethai.com/th/amusement/north/view.asp?id=0370 Thaiculture.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspg.org/fabel/doc3.htm rspg.or.th]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
Depending on the language group or clan, there are several Aboriginal stories regarding the origins of the Pleiades. Some [[Indigenous Australian]] peoples believed the Pleiades was a woman who had been nearly [[rape]]d by [[Kidili]], the man in the moon.

In a legend told by the [[Wurundjeri]] people of south-eastern Australia, the Pleiades were represented by the seven [[Karatgurk]] sisters. These women were the first to possess the secret of fire and each one carried live coals on the end of her [[digging stick]]. Although they refused to share these coals with anybody, they were ultimately tricked into giving up their secret by [[Crow (Australian Aboriginal mythology)|Crow]], who subsequently brought fire to mankind. After this, the Karatgurk sisters were swept into the night sky. Their glowing fire sticks became the bright stars of the Pleiades cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mudrooroo  | title =Aboriginal mythology: An A-Z spanning the history of the Australian Aboriginal people from the earliest legends to the present day  | publisher = Thorsons  | date = 1994  | location = London  | pages = 35–36  | isbn = 978-1-85538-306-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book |title=The Emu in the Sky: Stories about the Aboriginals and the day and night skies - The Emu |pages=15, 16 |author=Peter D'Arcy |editor=Margo Sutton |year=1994 |publisher=The National Science and Technology Centre|isbn=978-0-64618-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version, often painted by [[Gabriella Possum Nungurayyi]] as this is her [[Dreaming (story)|dreaming]] (or creation story), daughter of the late [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]] from the Central desert art movement of [[Papunya]], depicts the story of seven Napaltjarri sisters being chased by a man named Jilbi Tjakamarra. He tried to practice love magic on one of the sisters but the sister did not want to be with him, and ran away from him together with her sisters. They sat down at [[Uluru]] to search for honey ants but when they saw Jilbi, they went to Kurlunyalimpa and with the spirits of Uluru, transformed into stars. Jilbi transforms himself into what is commonly known as the [[Venus|Morning Star]]{{dubious|date=June 2017|Venus is a movable star and not in Orion's belt}} in [[Orion's belt]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}, thus continuing to chase the seven sisters across the sky.

=== Hawaii ===
There is an analogous holiday in [[Hawaiʻi]] known as [[Makahiki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/hawaiian/voyaging/files/t07-navigation/t07-01_glossary.html Hawaiian Voyaging Course&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
Occurring June 20 – June 22, the [[winter solstice]] (''Te Maruaroa o Takurua'') is seen by the New Zealand Māori as the middle of the winter season. It follows directly after the first sighting of ''[[Matariki]]'' (The Pleiades) and ''Puanga/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]])&lt;ref&gt;Rigel is ''Puanga'' in northern [[Māori language|Māori]], and ''Puaka'' in [[Māori language#South Island dialects|southern dialects]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the dawn sky, an event which marked the beginning of the New Year and was said to be when the Sun turned from his northern journey with his winter-bride ''Takurua'' ([[Sirius]]) and began his journey back to his summer-bride ''Hine Raumati''.

== Non-Saharan Africa ==

In the [[Swahili language]] of [[East Africa]] they are called "kilimia" ([[Proto-Bantu]] *'''ki-dimida''' in [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] areas E, F, G, J, L, and S) which comes from the verb ''-lima'' meaning "dig" or "cultivate" as their visibility was taken as a sign to prepare digging as the onset of the rain was near.

In the closely related [[Sesotho]] language of the [[Southern Africa]]'s [[Basotho]] people the Pleiades are called "Seleme se setshehadi" ("the female planter"). Its disappearance in April (the 10th month) and the appearance of the star [[Achernar]] signals the beginning of the cold season. Like many other Southern African cultures, Basotho associate its visibility with agriculture and plenty.

== Modern beliefs ==

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===

The 19th century astronomer [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler]] proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which all stars revolve around the star Alcyone, in the Pleiades. Based on this hypothesis, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religion taught until the 1950s that Alcyone was likely to be the site of the throne of God&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotes-watchtower.co.uk/god_s_throne_-_pleiades.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Theosophy ===
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it is believed the ''Seven Stars of the Pleiades'' focus the [[spiritual energy]] of the [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|Seven Rays]] from the ''Galactic Logos'' to the ''Seven Stars of the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]]'', then to [[Sirius]], then to the [[Sun]], then to the god of [[Earth]] ([[Sanat Kumara]]) and finally through the seven [[ascended master|Masters of the Seven Rays]] to us.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dr. Douglas ''The Seven Rays:Key to the Mysteries'' 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UFOs ===
In [[Ufology]] some believers describe [[Nordic alien]] extraterrestrials (called [[Pleiadeans]]) as originating from this system.

== New Age ==
In [[New Age]] lore, some believe that [[Sun]] and the [[Earth]] will pass through a [[Photon belt]] from the Pleiades, causing a cataclysm and/or initiating a spiritual transition (referred to variously as a "shift in consciousness," the "Great Shift," the "Shift of the Ages").

Barbara Marciniak, author of ''Bringers of the Dawn'', is one of the authors who contributes to the New Age mythos of Pleiadian ET beings who are linked to human ancestry.

'''Posthumanist art''' refers to [[art]] that can only be created in some part through the aid of [[digital technology]]. [[posthumanism|Posthumanist]] art can be either human-conceived, or machine-produced in whole or in part. The extent to which the human element is involved in the creation, whether by direct manipulation of the [[technology]], or by creation of the [[algorithm]] through which the art is created, can vary.

'''Purism''', referring to the arts, was a movement that took place between 1918 and 1925 that influenced French painting and architecture. Purism was led by [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier|Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier)]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created a variation of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement and called it Purism: where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. The main concepts were presented in their book ''Après le Cubisme'' (After Cubism) published in 1918.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Susan|title=Ozenfant and Purism: The Evolution of a Style 1915–1930|year=1981|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/purism Purism, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post World War I==
[[File:Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte, oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|right|Le Corbusier, 1921, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]]]]
Le Corbusier and Ozenfant were the creators of Purism. [[Fernand Léger]] was a principle associate.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; Purism was an attempt to restore regularity in a war-torn France post World War I.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt; Unlike what they saw as 'decorative' fragmentation of objects in Cubism, Purism proposed a style of painting where elements were represented as robust simplified forms with minimal detail, while embracing technology and the machine.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

Purism culminated in Le Corbusier’s ''Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau'' (Pavilion of the New Spirit), constructed for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925. This included the work of Cubists [[Juan Gris]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]]. Following this exhibition the relationship between Le Corbusier and Ozenfant declined.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

==L'Esprit Nouveau==

Ozenfant and Le Corbusier contributed extensively to an art magazine called ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' from 1920 to 1925 serving as a platform for propaganda towards their Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliel, Carol S. et al.

==Purist Manifesto==
The Purist Manifesto lays out the rules Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created to govern the Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

* Purism does not intend to be a scientific art, which it is in no sense.
* Cubism has become a decorative art of romantic ornamentism.
* There is a hierarchy in the arts: decorative art is at the base, the human figure at the summit.
* Painting is as good as the intrinsic qualities of its plastic elements, not their representative or narrative possibilities.
* Purism wants to conceive clearly, execute loyally, exactly without deceits; it abandons troubled conceptions, summary or bristling executions. A serious art must banish all techniques not faithful to the real value of the conception.
* Art consists in the conception before anything else.
* Technique is only a tool, humbly at the service of the conception.
* Purism fears the bizarre and the ''original''. It seeks the pure element in order to reconstruct organized paintings that seem to be facts from nature herself. 
* The method must be sure enough not to hinder the conception.
* Purism does not believe that returning to nature signifies the copying of nature.
* It admits all deformation is justified by the search for the invariant.
* All liberties are accepted in art except those that are unclear.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

'''Sentimental poetry''' is a [[melodramatic]] [[poetic form]]. It is aimed primarily at stimulating the [[emotion]]s rather than at communicating experience truthfully. [[Grief|Bereavement]] is a common theme of sentimental poetry. 

[[Friedrich Schiller]] discussed sentimental poetry in his influential essay, ''[[On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry]]''.

Sentimental poetry was parodied by [[Mark Twain]] in ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch|first1=Annie|title=The Poetess in American Literature|url=http://literature.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-472#acrefore-9780190201098-e-472-div1-1201|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the art medium|social practice (art)}}

'''Social artistry''' is the attempt to address or recognize a particular social issue using art and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; Social artists are people who use creative skills to work with people or organizations in their community to affect change.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://www.jeanhouston.org/Social-Artistry/social-artistry.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; While a traditional artist uses their creative skills to express their take on the world, a social artist puts their skills to use to help promote and improve communities. Thus, the main aim of a social artist is to improve society as a whole and to help other people find their own means of creative expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialartistryinstitute.org/who_we_are.htm Institute of Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artists may address issues such as youth alienation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/creative-youth-camps/ Creative Youth Camps]&lt;/ref&gt; or the breakdown of communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://education.jhu.edu/research/newhorizons/future/articles/social-artistry/index.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, social artists will address these problems by helping people express themselves and find their voice, or by bringing people together and using art to help them to foster an understanding of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wenger-Trayner [http://wenger-trayner.com/resources/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artistry can incorporate several different art forms including [[theatre]], [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]]. 

Findings from 2013 confirm the shift from individual expression to community engagement, or "from autonomous to socially engaged."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingo and Tepper cite several examples:
#contemporary artists "see themselves as educators, social workers, policy actors, and health providers (Lena &amp; Cornfield, 2008; Simonds, 2013; Throsby &amp; Zednik, 2011)
#Nick Rabkin writes "more arts graduates end up in education than in any other occupation" (2013)
#social practice artists "freely blur the lines among object making, performance, political activism, community organizing, environmentalism and investigative journalism, creating a deeply [[participatory art]] that often flourishes outside the gallery and museum system"&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8797">'''Sustainable art''' is art in harmony with the key principles of [[sustainability]], which include [[ecology]], [[social justice]], [[non-violence]] and [[grassroots democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Maja Fowkes and Reuben Fowkes (2006). "Principles of Sustainability in Contemporary Art". Praesens: central European contemporary art review. 1 (5-12) ISSN 1588-5534.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alan Sonfist Time Landscape of New York.jpg|thumb|"Time Landscape of New York" by Alan Sonfist (1965)]]
Sustainable art may also be understood as art that is produced with consideration for the wider impact of the work and its reception in relationship to its environments (social, economic, biophysical, historical and cultural).

== History ==
According to the contemporary art historians and curators [[Maja and Reuben Fowkes]], the origins of sustainable art can be traced to the [[conceptual art]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, with its stress on dematerialisation and questioning of the functioning of the art system.&lt;ref&gt;‘Planetary Forecast: The Roots of Sustainability in the Radical Art of the 1970s’ Third Text 100 Special Issue vol 23 issue 5 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They also connect the rise of the concept of sustainability to the ending of the Cold War in 1989 and the emergence of a new awareness of the global character of ecological and social problems.&lt;ref&gt;'The Ecology of Post-Socialism and the Implications of Sustainability for Contemporary Art' in ''Art and Theory After Socialism'' edited Malcolm Miles (Plymouth Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable art adopts, according to these authors, a critical position towards some key practitioners in the [[land art]] movement of the 1960s, who showed little concern for the environmental consequences of e.g. treating the landscape like a giant canvas with a bulldozer for a brush.&lt;ref&gt;“Art and Ecology – Economy Special Issue” (2006). Praesens: central European contemporary art review. 1. ISSN 1588-5534.&lt;/ref&gt; They have questioned the polemical division between 'autonomous' and 'instrumental' art originating with modernism, arguing that it is 'autonomy that gives art, as well as artists as social actors, the potential to be free and able to offer alternatives to dominant ideological paradigms.'&lt;ref&gt;Maja and Reuben Fowkes, 'Sensuous Resistance:the legacy of modernism for sustainable art' Dokumenta 12 magazine project (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 there is a Sustainable Arts Biennale running at Ihlienworth near Hamburg, Germany, curated by the German conceptional artist and curator Samuel J. Fleiner.
There are a range of interpretations over the relations between art and sustainability, besides the term 'sustainable art' promoted by Maja and Reuben Fowkes: Other authors prefer the broader notions of 'sustainability arts' or 'art and sustainability' (e.g. Kagan and Kirchberg).&lt;ref&gt;Eds Sacha Kagan and Volker Kirchberg (2008). "Sustainability: a new frontier for the arts and cultures". Frankfurt am Main: VAS. {{ISBN|978-3-88864-440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others explicitly rejected the use of the term 'sustainable art', referring instead to 'artistic work that inspires us to think about sustainability" (Margot Käßmann).&lt;ref&gt;Margot Käßmann. "The Spirit of Sustainability." Berlin: Rat für Nachhaltige Entwicklung.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional discussion of the relationship of contemporary art to notions of sustainability blossomed across Europe in the early years 2000, with e.g. the conference of the German Society for Political Culture (Instituts für Kulturpolitik der Kulturpolitischen Gesellschaft e.V.), in January 2002 at the Art Academy of Berlin, and the 'Tutzinger Manifest'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kupoge.de/ifk/tutzinger-manifest/kun.htm Kultur - Kunst - Nachhaltigkeit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An International Symposium on Sustainability and Contemporary Art took place at [[Central European University]], in Budapest (Hungary) in March 2006. This was the first in a series of international symposia organised by [[Maja and Reuben Fowkes]] bringing together contemporary artists, philosophers, environmental sciences and acvitists to explore common ground around issues such as 'Exit or Activism' (2008), 'Hard Realities and the New Materiality' (2009) and 'Art, Post-Fordism and Eco-Critique' (2010).[https://web.archive.org/web/20100115070048/http://www.translocal.org/sustainability/index.htm]. In March–April 2007 at the [[Lüneburg University|Leuphana University Lüneburg]], the Arts Research Network of the European Sociological Association focused its attention on the recent movements and approaches to 'arts and sustainability' at its biennial conference.&lt;ref&gt;Volker Kirchberg, Sacha Kagan and Christoph Behnke (2007). "Final Report: ESA Research Network for the Sociology of the Arts". Lüneburg: Leuphana Universität Lüneburg. {{ISBN|978-3935786485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key texts in the emerging field of sustainable art include 'Kultur - Kunst - Nachhaltigkeit' (2002) by Hildegard Kurt and Bernd Wagner,&lt;ref&gt;Eds Hildegard Kurt and Bernd Wagner (2002). "Kultur - Kunst - Nachhaltigkeit". Klartext-Verlag. {{ISBN|978-3898610933}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘The Principles of Sustainability in Contemporary Art’ (2006) by Maja and Reuben Fowkes &lt;ref&gt;See also: Maja Fowkes and Reuben Fowkes (2004).

'''Talking animals''' are a common theme in [[mythology]] and [[Folklore|folk tales]], as well as [[children's literature]]. Fictional talking animals often are [[anthropomorphic]], possessing human-like qualities but appearing as a creature. The usage of talking animals enable storytellers to combine the basic characteristics of the animal with human behavior, to apply metaphor, and to entertain children.

There are a number of alleged real-life [[talking animal]]s.

== Talking creatures which are still creatures ==

The creature retains its original form without much change, other than being able to speak. Sometimes it may only speak as a narration for the reader's convenience. The rabbits in ''[[Watership Down]]'' who, except for the ability to discuss their actions, behave exactly as normal rabbits, also come under this category, as do characters from animated films like ''[[Happy Feet (film)|Happy Feet]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]''.

[[File:Oz Billina byKoehne.jpg|right|thumb|Billina, a talking chicken in Oz, by [[André Koehne]]]]

The talking creature concept is featured within much traditional literature, such as in [[Aesop's Fables]], and several mythologies, including [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] and [[Vedic mythology|Indian]] mythologies. A notable example from the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition is the talking [[serpent (Bible)|serpent]] from the [[Book of Genesis]], which tempts [[Eve]] to eat the forbidden fruit of the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s include apparent talking creatures that prove to be [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] people, or even [[ghost]]s.  The fairy tales ''[[How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon]]'' and ''[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]'' have the hero aided by a fox and a wolf respectively, but in the similar tale ''[[The Golden Bird]]'', the talking fox is freed from a spell to become the heroine's brother, and in ''[[The Bird 'Grip']]'', the fox leaves the hero after explaining that it was the [[Grateful dead (folklore)|dead man]] whose debts the hero had paid.

Whether shape-shifted or merely having the magical ability to speak, the talking creature is perhaps the most common trait of [[fairy tale]]s.  The motif is certainly present in many more tales than fairies.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 55, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angelos London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous modern [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories intermix human and creature characters.  In [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[Land of Oz]], creatures (such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger) talk.  The chicken Billina gains the ability to talk when she is swept away by a storm to land near Oz, as do other animals, and Toto, it is explained in a [[retcon]], always had the ability since arriving in Oz, but never used it. In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', the world of Narnia is ruled by a talking lion by the name of [[Aslan]], and many small characters are talking woodland animals, both of which interact with both the humans of Narnia, and the children who act as the protagonists of the books.

== Creatures that portray humans ==

Most people in the industries of [[professional]] [[illustration]], [[cartoon]]ing, and [[animation]] refer to these types of creature characters as '''talking animals''',&lt;ref&gt;Katalin Orban, ''Ethical Diversions: The Post-Holocaust Narratives of Pynchon, Abish, DeLillo, and Spiegelman'', New York, London: Routledge, 2005, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[funny animal]]s''' or '''anthropomorphic characters'''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Keith Booker (ed.), ''Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2014, pp. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the mainstream news media and members of [[furry fandom]] more commonly refer to this variety of talking animals as '''furries'''. The earliest example of talking creatures portraying humans, as opposed to talking creatures portraying creatures, was in [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'' (''Fables of Bidpai''), which was set in a world of talking creatures who represent human morals and behavior. A good [[Western World|Western]] example of the genre is [[Henryson]]'s ''[[Fabillis]]''. The webcomic "Anima: Age of the Robots" ([[Anima (webcomic)]]) uses anthropomorphism to portray an alternate world as modern as ours, but inhabited by creature-lookalikes. The intelligent robots they have made rebel and threaten the creatures. This serves as a warning to mankind's thoughtless pursuit of technological advancement.

'''''The Floating Piers''''' was a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] work of art by [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]], consisting of 70,000 square meters of yellow fabric, carried by a modular floating dock system of 226,000 high-density polyethylene cubes installed at [[Lake Iseo]] near [[Brescia]], Italy. The fabric created a walkable surface between [[Sulzano]], [[Monte Isola]] and the island of San Paolo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36567871|title=Italy: Christo 'walk on water' project opens on Lake Iseo - BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==
Christo and Jeanne-Claude began conceptualizing of ''The Floating Piers'' in 1970. Their initial site was [[Rio de la Plata]] between [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. The couple also considered [[Tokyo Bay]] as a location before moving on to other projects.&lt;ref name="fastcodesign1"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Brownlee |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3061111/christos-floating-piers-were-50-years-and-17-million-in-the-making |title=Christo's Floating Piers Were 50 Years And $17 Million In The Making &amp;#124; Co.Design &amp;#124; business + design |website=Fastcodesign.com |date=2016-06-21 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, Christo settled on [[Lake Iseo]] as the location for ''The Floating Piers'' and dedicated the next 22 months to realizing the project. It was the first major project he undertook after the death of his partner and collaborator Jeanne-Claude.

The project was estimated to cost $11 million, but was later reported at closer to $17 million.&lt;ref name="fastcodesign1"/&gt; The funds were raised by Christo himself through sales of his project sketches and original art. Permits took less than a year.

The physical installation of the piers was handled by Deep Dive Systems, a company based in Bulgaria. They installed about 220 six-ton anchors in the lake floor at depths of up to 92 meters, over a period of three months. 226,000 cubes were then attached to those anchors, and covered by 70,000 sq. meters of nylon fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Opening==
[[File:Floating Piers – San Paolo.jpg|thumb|View from Monte Isola]]
On June 18, 2016, the saffron-colored walkway opened to the public. 270,000 people visited the free installation in its first five days. Due to the unexpectedly large crowds, organizers began closing the installation from midnight to 6 a.m. each day to allow for cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Closing ==

On July 3, 2016, the work closed to the public; local officials estimated that it had attracted 1.2 million visitors, or an average of 72,000 per day, over its 16-day run. Police estimates were even higher, at 100,000 visitors per day. Dismantling of the project began in the early morning of July 4, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14564">'''Victimless Leather''' – a prototype of a stitch-less jacket, grown from cell cultures into a layer of tissue supported by a coat shaped polymer layer.&lt;ref name="hovedside"&gt;[http://tcaproject.org/projects/victimless/leather TC&amp;A – Victimless Leather] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a sub-project of the [[Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project]] where the artists are growing a [[leather]] jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of [[garment]] by making it semi-living. This artistic grown garment is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.

__TOC__

==Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project==

The [[SymbioticA]] website explains what it is, "an artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning, critique and hands-on engagement with the life sciences.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbiotica.uwa.edu.au/ Official SymbioticA website] Retrieved 03.20.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The artists work with tissue, constructing and growing complex organisms that can live outside the body, making the new objects semi-living. Their projects are meant to question life, identity and the relationship between humans and other living beings and environments. They are also interested in the ethics around partial life and the possibilities around this type of technology in the future.&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;[http://tcaproject.org/ TC&amp;A website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

These are some of the sub-projects that are also part of the TC&amp;A project, in addition to Victimless Leather:

'''NoArk''' – NoArk is a collection of cells and tissue from many different organisms, growing together inside a "vessel", a reference to [[Noah's Ark]]. The project website states that NoArk is "a tangible as well as symbolic ‘craft’ for observing and understanding a biology that combines the familiar with the other".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/noark.html TC&amp;A – NoArk] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Worry Dolls''' – Seven modern versions of the Guatemalan [[Worry doll]] were hand-crafted of degradable [[polymers]] and surgical sutures and seeded with skin, muscle and bone tissue. The tissue was then allowed to grow inside a bioreactor, replacing the polymers as it degrades, thus creating seven semi-living dolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/ars/main_frames.html TC&amp;A – Worry Dolls] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''Disembodied Cuisine''' – Along with Victimless Leather, this is part of the "Victimless Utopia". The idea for this project was to take cells from a frog and grow them into something possible to eat, displaying it next to the still living frog the food came from. This problemetizes the whole meat industry – how we kill animals to eat them. Growing tissue outside of the body of the animal is a way to "make" meat while the animal stays healthy and living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/disembodied/dis.html TC&amp;A – Disembodied Cuisine] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Extra Ear – ¼ Scale''' – Using human tissue, a quarter-scale replica of artist [[Stelarc]]'s ear was grown. The project wanted to confront the cultural perceptions of life now that we are able to manipulate living systems, and also discuss the notions of the wholeness of the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html TC&amp;A – Extra Ear – ¼ Scale] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''The Pig Wings Project''' – This project bases its ideas on [[xenotransplantation]] and genetically modifying pigs so their organs can be transplanted to humans. The artists used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies to grow pig bone tissue, forming three different sets of wings. One set shaped as bat wings ("evil"), one as bird wings ("good") and one as pterosaurs wings ("neutral").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/pig/pig_main.html TC&amp;A – The Pig Wings Project] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Idea==
An aim for the "Victimless Leather" project is to explore and provoke scientific truths, using conceptual art projects to encourage better understanding of cultural ideas around scientific knowledge. The project website point out how clothing has always been used to protect the fragile skin of humans, but lately have evolved into a fabricated object used as a tool to show one's identity. Based on this, clothing can be explored as a tangible example of the relationship between humans and others, and how humans treat others. As the artists put it: "This particular project will deconstruct our cultural meaning of clothes as a second skin by materialising it and displaying it as an art object."&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

The intention to grow artificial leather without killing an animal is meant as a contribution to a cultural discussion between art, science and society. Making this jacket presents a possibility of wearing leather that is not part of a dead animal. The projects are presented in Workshops and exhibitions throughout the world to address ethical questions related to [[bioscience]] and [[technology]]. The artists want the project to be seen in this cultural context, not a commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Genetologic Research] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Their intention is not to create a consumer product, but to offer a starting point for the cultural discussion points mentioned above. As with most of the TC&amp;A projects the artists are concerned with the relationship between humans and other living systems, both natural and scientific made or manipulated.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

== The Victimless Leather project ==

[[File:Victimless leather.jpg|thumb|left|x450px|Victimless leather, photo from TC&amp;A webpage [http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/vl/images.html]]]

===Growing the jacket===
The artists wanted to make a leather-like material using living tissue, and ended up making it in the shape of a stitchless jacket. The artists based the jacket on a biodegradable polymer, coated it with [[3T3 cells|3T3]] mouse cells to form connective tissue and topped it up with human [[bone cells]] in order to create a stronger skin layer.

To create the victimless leather, the team needed an artificial environment where semi-living entities are grown, so it is grown inside a bioreactor that acts as a surrogate body. The bioreactor used in this project was custom made, based on an organ perfusion pump designed by [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]]. It has an automatic dripping system which feeds the cells.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt; The artists assumed that when the polymer degraded, an integrated jacket would appear. The resulting jacket was tiny, about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high and 1,4&amp;nbsp;inches wide and would just fit a mouse.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 Wired – Jacket Grows From Living Tissue] Retrieved 10.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

To idealize the "victimless" of the jacket, immortalized cell lines or cells that divide and multiply forever once they are removed from an animal or human host forming a renewable resource, have been used in the project. The 3T3 mouse cells all come from a mouse who lived in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 The technoscientific body] Retrieved 03.31.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
The research and development of “Victimless Leather” has been conducted in SymbioticA: the Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia and in consultation with Professor Arunasalam Dharmarajan from the School of Anatomy and Human Biology as well as Verigen, a Perth-based company that specializes in tissue engineered cartilage for clinical applications. Western Australia state made the investment in the project through ArtsWa in Association with the Lotteries Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Victimless Leather Jacket] Retrieved 05.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Killing the Jacket====
The victimless leather was featured in the exhibition “Design and the Elastic Mind” at [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], United States. [http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/index.html] [http://www.moma.org/] February 24 – May 12, 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/news.html TC&amp;A News] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project was scheduled to grow continuously until May 12 when the exhibition ended. There were some problems though, when the leather started expanding too quickly, clogging tubes inside the bioreactor. The exhibition leader therefore decided to unplug the project before the end of the exhibition – in a way, killing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/54636/ TheScientist – Victimless Jacket, R.I.P.] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===

Because the artificial leather is made semi-living, the project might be seen as speculative and provocative to some people – questioning whether it is better to kill semi-living beings rather than living beings. "One of the most common and somewhat surprising comments we heard was that people were disturbed by our ethics of using living cells to grow living fabric, while the use of leather obtained from animals seems to be accepted without any concern for the well-being of the animals from which the skin has been removed." artist Ionat Zurr uttered after showing the jacket to the public on "The Space Between" exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacebetween.org.au/ The Space Between] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

==Related work and ideas==
The project also focuses on human consumption, highlighting that there are victims on every level of it, and that the boundaries between harm and benefit often are blurred. The French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] strongly opposed hunting of animals for vanity and the commercial purpose of the skin. From an indigenous point of view, the context must be{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} seen different. An [[Inuit]] hunts the [[Pinniped|seal]] and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bambusspiele.de/spiele/nanuuk/e_nunavut.htm – Arctic hunters], Retrieved 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to ethics like this, is the interest for artificial meat production due to reactions against the livestock sector because of health and environmental problems. A 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO report pointed out the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems like soil degradation and water pollution. And because of methane, it spews out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908170494.html – All Africa] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Art and video games}}

'''Video game art''' is a specialized form of [[computer art]] employing [[video game]]s as the [[artistic medium]]. Video game art often involves the use of [[Patch (computing)|patched]] or [[Mod (video gaming)|modified video games]] or the repurposing of existing games or game structures, however it relies on a broader range of artistic techniques and outcomes than [[Art mod|artistic modification]] and it may also include painting, sculpture, appropriation, in-game intervention and performance, sampling, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936302522|title=Works of Game.|last=John.|first=Sharp,|date=2016-01-01|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262029070|oclc=936302522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876434897|title=Videogames and Art|last=Andy,|first=Clarke,|last2=Grethe,|first2=Mitchell,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Intellect|isbn=9781841504193|oclc=876434897}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It may also include the creation of [[art game]]s either from scratch or by modifying existing games. Notable examples of video game art include [[Cory Arcangel]]'s "Super Mario Clouds" and "I Shot Andy Warhol,"&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;Andy Clarke and Grethe Mitchell (eds.),''Videogames and Art'' (Intellect Books, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Delappe]]'s projects including "Dead in Iraq" and the "Salt Satyagraha Online: Gandhi's March to Dandi in Second Life,"&lt;ref&gt;Mail Away: War Correspondence at Home and Away, by Lindsay Kelley, in the Media-N Journal of the New Media Caucus {{cite web|url=http://www.newmediacaucus.org/html/journal/issues.php?f%3Dpapers%26time%3D2009_summer%26page%3Dkelley |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518135157/http://www.newmediacaucus.org/html/journal/issues.php?f=papers&amp;time=2009_summer&amp;page=kelley |archivedate=May 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Salt Satyahgraha by Joseph Delappe - review by Natasha Chuk, in Furtherfield http://www.furtherfield.org/netbehaviour/salt-satyagraha-joseph-delappe-review-natasha-chuk&lt;/ref&gt; the 2004-2005 Rhizome Commissions "relating to the theme of games,"&lt;ref&gt;Rhizome Commissions http://rhizome.org/commissions/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paolo Pedercini]]'s [[Molleindustria]] games such as "Unmanned" and "[[Every Day the Same Dream]]", and [[Ian Bogost]]'s "[[Cow Clicker|Cowclicker]]."

Artistic modifications are frequently made possible through the use of [[level editor]]s, though other techniques exist. Some artists make use of [[machinima]] applications to produce non-interactive animated artworks, however artistic modification is not synonymous with machinima as these form only a small proportion of artistic modifications.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Machinima is distinct from art mods as it relies on different tools, though there are many similarities with some art mods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Like video games, artistic game modifications are often interactive and may allow for single-player or multiplayer experience. Multiplayer works make use of networked environments to develop new kinds of interaction and collaborative art production.

==Techniques==
===Machinima===
{{Main|Machinima}}
[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|Right|[[Machinima]] filmed in [[Second life]]]]

Machinima is the use of real-time [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3-D) graphics [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] engines to generate [[computer animation]]. The term also refers to works that incorporate this animation technique.

===In-game intervention and performance===
Artists may intervene in online games in a non-play manner, often disrupting games in progress in order to challenge or expose underlying conventions and functions of game play. Examples of this include [[Anne Marie Schleiner]]'s ''Velvet-Strike'' (a project designed to allow players of realistic first person shooter games to use anti-war graffiti within the game to make an artistic statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensorcery.net/velvet-strike |title=Velvet-Strike |publisher=Opensorcery.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Dead in Iraq'' (an art project created by Joseph DeLappe in which the player character purposely allows himself to be shot and then recites the names of US soldiers who have died in the Iraq War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/art/DELAPPE/Gaming/Dead_In_Iraq/dead_in_iraq%20JPEGS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206122903/http://www.unr.edu/art/DELAPPE/Gaming/Dead_In_Iraq/dead_in_iraq%20JPEGS.html |archivedate=December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Site-specific installations and site-relative mods===
[[Site-specific art|Site-specific]] [[Installation art|installations]] and site-relative [[Mod (computer gaming)|gaming modifications]] ("mods"), replicate real-world places (often the art gallery in which they are displayed) to explore similarities and differences between real and virtual worlds. An example is ''What It Is Without the Hand That Wields It'', where blood from kills in Counterstrike manifests and spills into a real life gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=8/23/06 4:15pm 8/23/06 4:15pm |url=http://kotaku.com/375624/a-counter+strike-game-that-spills-real-fake-blood |title=People Actually Lamer Than Stuart Scott Rip On Stuart Scott |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real-time performance instruments===
Video games can be incorporated into live audio and visual performance using a variety of instruments and computers such as keyboards embedded with music chips.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} See also [[chiptune]] and the [[Fijuu]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fijuu.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017041501/http://fijuu.com/ |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generative art mods===
Generative art mods exploit the real-time capabilities of game technologies to produce ever-renewing autonomous artworks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Examples include [[Julian Oliver]]'s ''[[ioq3apaint]]'', a generative painting system that uses the actions of software agents in combat to drive the painting process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver |first=Julian |url=http://julianoliver.com |title=Julian Oliver |publisher=Julian Oliver |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://selectparks.net/~julian/ioq3apaint ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512053311/http://selectparks.net/~julian/ioq3apaint |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alison Mealy]]'s ''[[UnrealArt]]'' which takes the movements of game entities and uses them to control a drawing process in an external program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=風紀委員 posted by alisonmealey.com on 2014年2月20日 |url=http://alisonmealey.com |title=色々な風俗がありますが全部が魅力的すぎます |publisher=Alisonmealey.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrealart.co.uk |title=will be back online soon |publisher=Unreal Art |date=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kent Sheely]]'s "Cities in Flux," a [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] mod that glitches and distorts the game's world in real-time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentsheely.com/dpad2012 |title=Viewer-generated screenshots: "Cities in Flux" – D-Pad Toronto 2012 // kent sheely |publisher=Kentsheely.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[RetroYou]]'s ''[[R/C Racer]]'' a modification of the graphic elements of a racing game which results in rich fields of colour and shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retroyou.org |title=full void |publisher=Retroyou.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retroyou.org/rc.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611041938/http://www.retroyou.org/rc.html |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{VG Industry}}
The '''video game industry''' is the [[economic sector]] involved in the [[Video game development|development]], marketing, and [[Video game monetization|monetization of video games]]. It encompasses dozens of [[job]] disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Zackariasson, P. and Wilson, T.L. eds. (2012). ''The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, faster [[CPU]]s, and dedicated co-processors like [[PhysX]] are a few of the more notable improvements.

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref name="sndhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alldidigames.com/video-games-industry-infographics/ | publisher=Didi Games | work=Research on Video Games | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Didi Games | accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; Later, graphic cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt;

== Game industry value chain ==
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
# Product and talent layer: includes [[Video game developer|developers]], [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as [[smartphones]]. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.&lt;ref name="newmedia"&gt;

== Disciplines ==
The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2965/2526#36&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Early history of video games|Early mainframe games}}
Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not "video games", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 "Nimatron", an electromagentic relay-based [[Nim]]-playing device designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]],&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|title=The Priesthood At Play: Computer Games in the 1950s |work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-01-22|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172058/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]],&lt;ref name="CNE"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlene|last=Simmons|title=Bertie the Brain programmer heads science council |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=916,3790974&amp;dq=josef-kates&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=1975-10-09|page=17|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] created by engineering firm [[Ferranti]] for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Replay: The History of Video Games]]|last=Donovan|first=Tristan|publisher=Yellow Ant|date=2010-04-20|isbn=978-0-9565072-0-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[cathode ray tube]]&amp;mdash;the core technology behind televisions&amp;mdash;created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a "cathode ray tube amusement device". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofplay.org/about/icheg/video-game-history/timeline |title=Video Game History Timeline &amp;#124; The Strong |publisher=Museumofplay.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|title=One, Two, Three, Four I Declare a Space War|work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-08-07|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172136/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of easy-to-program languages like [[BASIC]] for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

The early part of the decade saw the rise of [[8-bit]] home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs.
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt; while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]] and [[Gremlin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html|title=World of Spectrum - Archive - YS Top 100|work=worldofspectrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]]

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, [[brand licensing|licensed]] games became more popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/896/896893p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Madden - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurby |first=Patrick |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden |title=ESPN - OTL: The Franchise - E-ticket |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did video game sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/954/954426p2.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as [[Smartphones]], [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s were developed and become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Game development for mobile phones (such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of $300 million.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/ |title=Zynga Takes $180 Million Venture Round From DST, Others (Cue Russian Mafia Jokes) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these have grown to substantial size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/50e5d9379521 |title=The Future of Games and How to Stop It |last1=Radoff |first1=Jon |last2= |first2= |date=February 10, 2014 |website=medium.com |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, [[eSports]] centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/29/sport/esports-revolution-revenue-audience-growth/index.html | title = ESports: Global revenue expected to smash $1 billion by 2019 | first = Don | last=  Riddell | date = May 29, 2016 | accessdate = January 16, 2018  | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s.  In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Superannuation|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?|url=http://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649|website=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method [[Video game monetization|to sell or earn money from]] the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs and increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Why Digital Distribution Is The Future And GameStop Is Not: Taking The Long View On Used Games|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/05/30/why-digital-distribution-is-the-future-and-gamestop-is-not-taking-the-long-view-on-used-games/|website=Forbes|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over $650 [[United States dollar|USD]] million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022802/http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision |date=January 25, 2011 }}.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of [[Triple A (gaming)|high-budget, high-quality titles]] under development. In 2013 [[Richard Hilleman]] of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="vgchartz20130706"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251108/ea-aaa-development-in-decline/ | title=EA: AAA Development in Decline | work=VGChartz | date=July 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013 | author=D'Angelo, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

The games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as [[GameStop]], following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as [[Blockbuster (company)|Blockbuster]], [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], and [[Virgin Megastores]]. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wingfield |first1=Nick |title=As Downloads Take Over, a Turning Point for the Video Game Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-12-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/technology/as-downloads-take-over-a-turning-point-for-the-video-game-industry.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=GAME launches Belong - is this the future of video games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-12-16 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-15-game-launches-belong-is-this-the-future-of-video-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |last2=Totilo |first2=Stephen |title=Video Game Retail Sales Decline Despite New Hits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-10-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/video-games/video-game-retail-sales-decline-despite-new-hits.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=What's going wrong at UK games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-21 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-21-whats-going-wrong-at-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more in this source --&gt; Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=Is the industry's obsession with Day One coming to an end? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-08 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-is-the-industrys-obsession-with-day-one-coming-to-an-end |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV UK]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: trade-in myths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &amp;#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[Freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] (faked) transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video game industry continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].

=== Gaming conventions ===
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual gaming conventions include [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany), the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA),&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=E3 is Obsolete, But it Doesn't Matter|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/06/08/e3-is-obsolete-but-it-doesnt-matter/|publisher=Forbes|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Penny Arcade Expo]], and [[:Category:Video game conventions|others]].

[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Other notable conventions and trade fairs include [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo &amp; Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.

{{main|Video gaming in Germany}}

[[Germany]] has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion forecast for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-100-countries-by-game-revenues/|title=Top 100 Countries By Game Revenues|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=newzoo.com|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] is Europe's largest gaming expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]] (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. The [[Anno (series)|Anno series]] and [[The Settlers|The Settlers series]] are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The [[Gothic series]], [[SpellForce: The Order of Dawn|SpellForce]] and [[Risen (video game)|Risen]] are established RPG franchises. The [[X (game series)|X series]] by [[Egosoft]] is the best-selling space simulation. The [[FIFA Manager (video game series)|FIFA Manager series]] was also developed in Germany. The German action game [[Spec Ops: The Line]] (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is ''[[Far Cry]]'' (2004) by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced the topseller ''[[Crysis]]'' and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include [[Ascaron]], [[Blue Byte]], [[Deck13 Interactive|Deck13]], [[EA Phenomic|Phenomic]], [[Piranha Bytes]], [[Radon Labs|Radon]], [[Related Designs|Related]], [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[Yager Development]]. Publishers include [[Deep Silver]] ([[Koch Media]]), [[dtp entertainment]], [[Kalypso Media|Kalypso]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo Europe]]. [[Bigpoint Games]], [[Gameforge]], [[Goodgame Studios]] and [[Wooga]] are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

=== Japan ===
{{main|Video gaming in Japan}}
[[File:Nintendo office.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Nintendo]] in [[Kyoto]], Japan, 2006.]]
The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.

&lt;!-- Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;
Japanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the ''[[Mario]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of games.

&lt;!-- [[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general. --&gt;
In recent years, [[video game console|consoles]] and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable [[free-to-play]] games on the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms.&lt;ref name=economist12&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan fights back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21566696-two-japanese-firms-are-challenging-world-new-kind-video-game-japan-fights-back|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capcom_marketdata&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} --&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed.&lt;ref name="networkworld1"/&gt; The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-04-04-view-from-the-tower|title=The View From the Tower|publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Codemasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Colin McRae Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]''.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625151807/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[Magnavox]] is credited for releasing the first [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. [[Activision]] was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, [[Atari]] crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Companies====
The U.S. is home to major game development companies such as [[Activision Blizzard]] (''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]''), [[Electronic Arts]] (''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]''), and [[Take-Two Interactive]] ([[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], [[NBA 2K (series)|''NBA 2K'' series]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). [[ZeniMax Media]] (''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'') is the world's largest privately held video game company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Zenimax+Claims+Carmack+Stole+Oculus+VR+Facebook+Barks+Back/article34869.htm|title=Zenimax Claims Carmack Stole Oculus VR, Facebook Barks Back|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic]] (''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'', ''[[Pokémon Go]]'') is a notable mobile game developer.

[[Valve Corporation]] operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/|title=VGChartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by [[Google]] ([[Google Play]]), and [[Apple Inc.]] ([[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia.&lt;ref name=idcannie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-idc-portable-gaming-report-2013-q2/|author=App Annie, IDC|title=App Annie &amp; IDC Portable Gaming Report Q2 2013: iOS &amp; Google Play Game Revenue 4x Higher Than Gaming-Optimized Handhelds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] operates [[Xbox]], the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company. [[Sony]] established [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] in [[Silicon Valley]] to run [[PlayStation]], the world's largest and longest-running video game console franchise.&lt;ref name=wired-sie&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony Interactive Entertainment Merges PlayStation Biz Units|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/sony-interactive-entertainment/|accessdate=January 26, 2016|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel]] and [[Nvidia]] are the largest makers of PC graphics chips. [[Advanced Micro Devices]] has become the most important console [[Microprocessor|processor]] vendor, with all three of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation home consoles]] using AMD [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s, and two of them use AMD [[central processing unit|CPU]]s. Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD processors until all their consoles were announced,&lt;ref name=e12a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/12/amd-vp-saeid-moshkelani-interview/|work=[[Engadget]]|title=AMD's Saeid Moshkelani on building custom silicon for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U |date=June 12, 2013 |first=Michael |last=Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the secrecy found within the game industry. Notable game engine developers include [[Epic Games]] ([[Unreal Engine]]) and [[Unity Technologies]] ([[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]).

====Regions====
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is home to important video game conventions, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in [[North America]]. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Seattle]]. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Texas]].

====People====
Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/industry-facts/|title=Industry Facts|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/article/new-study-finds-video-game-players-are-highly-engaged-politically/|title=New Study Finds Video Game Players Are Highly Engaged Politically|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important [[List of video game industry people|game development personalities]] were born in or moved to the United States. Notable developers include [[Ralph H. Baer]] ([[Magnavox Odyssey]], the "Father of Video Games"), [[Jonathan Blow]] (''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''), [[John D. Carmack]] (''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''), and [[Alexey Pajitnov]] (''[[Tetris]]''). [[Mario]] is named after [[Mario Segale]], a former landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]. Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] activists, including [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Anita Sarkeesian]], have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ | title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides | author= Allum Bokhari | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate= September 27, 2014|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports====
The United States recognizes [[eSports]] players as professional athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/07/14/the-u-s-now-recognizes-esports-players-as-professional-athletes/|title=The U.S. Now Recognizes eSports Players As Professional Athletes|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Gaming]] has eSports arenas and studios across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/23/major-league-gaming-announces-its-own-arena-in-columbus-ohio/|title=Major League Gaming announces its own arena in Columbus, Ohio|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Morris University]] has a [[League of Legends]] [[varsity team]], whose members are eligible for [[scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/219522/Illinois_university_makes_League_of_Legends_a_varsity_sport.php |title=Illinois university makes League of Legends a varsity sport|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==
Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt;

The industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220–221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, "Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=222|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have made significant contributions to [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], a genre which predates Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. The earliest musicians were [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent, whose lyrics "reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all [[human experience]]." Indigenous communities reserved [[women in music|music for women]], who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. [[Ethnomusicologist]]s have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane [[flute]]s from the [[Inca Empire]] which indicate a preference for women with a high [[vocal range]]. Women had equal [[social status]], were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, [[machismo]] ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated [[Native American music|native music]] with "savagery" and European music with "civilization". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the [[slave trade]] (which increased the population of [[African slaves]]), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with [[syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]]; European settlement introduced [[harmony]] and the Spanish [[décima]] song form.

Since the [[history of sound recording|pre-recording era of music]], Latin music was male-dominated, and there are relatively few examples of female [[songwriter]]s, [[music producer]]s, [[record executive]]s, and [[music promoter|promoters]]. Women lacked access to musical training; music programs were nonexistent, and cultural norms discouraged female participation. Latin music had a primarily male presence; men discriminated against women, limiting them to singing or dancing and discouraging them from becoming [[instrumentalist]]s, writers, [[List of women composers|composers]], [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives. Women artists in the sub-genres of Latin music, such as [[Selena]], [[Jenni Rivera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Ivy Queen]], [[Julieta Venegas]], and [[Ely Guerra]]. have been credited with enhancing the genres' female presence; they have broken through barriers, reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of [[female sexuality]], gender, and [[femininity]]. Women in [[salsa music]] are significantly underrepresented in the industry as very few women, with the exception of [[Celia Cruz]], have been associated with the emergence of the genre; for example, in the British documentary ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cites'' (1985), Cruz is one of the only female singers who is mentioned.

Women Latin singers have a significant demographic imbalance on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[music charts]] compared with their male counterparts. As radio formats explore genres popularized and led by men, such as [[reggaeton]] and [[regional Mexican music]], women on the ''Billboard'' Latin music charts are periodically absent. The last female singer with a number-one single was [[Sofia Reyes]], whose collaborative "[[Solo Yo]]" ended a five-year drought on the [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart in 2016. A year earlier, on the 50-position [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart, 22 weeks passed without a song by a women. Reyes has expressed concern about the disparity between male and female performances at Latin music award shows, noting that 90 percent of the performers are male. Other female singers, such as [[Chiquis Rivera]], have attributed the decline in visibility of women in Latin music to  [[sexist]] radio programmers. Latin music executive Alexandra Lioutikoff believes that the decline is due to a lack of female collaboration. Latin music remains male-dominated, and the [[music industry]] has "prejudiced practice" limiting female recording artists.

== Characteristics ==
Latin American music is varied; it includes thirty countries, influenced by [[European music|European]], [[African American music|African]], and [[Native American music|Amerindian]] cultures.{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Latin music uses two European languages: [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], though modern-day widely distinguishes the genre as primarily sung or recorded in Spanish and to a lesser extent [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Although heterogeneous, Latin music commonly includes the Spanish [[décima]] song form, African [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]], and European [[harmony (music)|harmony]].{{sfn|Miller|2008|p=254}}

Pre-modern Latin music refers to music made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent.{{sfn|Navarro|Sánchez|Ali|1999|p=5}} The first inhabitants of Latin America settled 30,000 years before the arrival of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] at the peak of native cultural diversification into simple and complex societies.{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} These societies included sedentary agricultural tribes and [[hunter gatherers]],{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} who sang [[prayer]]s to a deity asking for prosperity{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} with lyrics of "conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience" and music reflecting their understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} They had "intricate ways of explaining the relationships between the sound, social organization, time, and the sacred",{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} and their rituals included dramatized performances of mythology vocalizing their view of [[creationism|creation]].{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}} The creation myth of the [[Keres people]] of [[Laguna Pueblo]] (present west-central [[New Mexico]]) describes "the unformed cosmos as the domain of [[Tse che nako]] (Thought Woman or Spider Woman) who [[chant]]s life into two sacred bundles that become the sisters [[Keres (mythology)|Uretsete and Naosete]] (She Who Matters and She Who Remembers)."{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}}

Indigenous communities predating Columbus' arrival reserved [[women in music|music for women]], although men were equally involved in dance.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=170}} During the [[Inca Empire]] in the mid-14th century, women from royal families and selected ''acallas'' (chosen ones) were taught science, art, poetry, and music from "wise elders".{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The "chosen ones" were selected for their beauty and "quality of their voices."{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} There were six houses, one of which was called the ''taquiaclla'' (''taqui'' means "song"),&lt;!-- In what language? --&gt; which housed girls aged nine to fifteen with "gifted" singing voices.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The [[Andean civilizations|Andeans]] preferred young women with a high [[vocal range]].{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Although no scripts or musical notation survive, archaeologists have uncovered a variety of ceramic, animal bone, and cane [[flute]]s.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} [[Ethnomusicologist]]s who have measured the flutes have found their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] compatible with a high vocal range.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Women in these communities were well-treated,{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} with equal opportunities to teach, perform, sing, and dance (as soloists, with other women, or in pairs with men).{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=139}} Female singers had a social status equal to men, receiving musical training and opportunities with their male counterparts.{{sfn|Sturman|2015}}

Columbus' arrival in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] brought [[patriarchy]] and [[machismo]] to the continent, overriding sexual equality.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} Early [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]] described women as "property and mistrusted [by men]."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} In a song, "Delgadina", women are servants who must please their men "no matter the cost."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} According to author Janet Sturman, the Iberian idea of machismo (in which a strong man is superior to others, including women) was held by the [[conquistadors]].{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} Europeans who settled in the [[New World]] associated native music with "savagery" and European music with "civilization".{{sfn|Berglund|Johnson|Lee|2016|p=17}} During the [[slave trade]], musicians in Latin America primarily had a dark complexion.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} This was due to an increased population of African slaves and contemporary society's view of music as a profession.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Most slaves arriving in Brazil were "bi-musical",&lt;!-- "Bi-musical" needs explanation. --&gt; and introduced their music to [[Music of Brazil|the country]].{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Rural [[Quechua language|Quechua]]-speaking [[Bolivia]]n farmers sang about European resistance in songs with Native American and European influences.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}} [[Dark skin|Black]] Bolivians sang songs with lyrics reflecting a European influence, performed as Africanized European music.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}}

In colonial Latin America, [[nun]]s wrote, directed, and performed music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} They played a variety of instruments, including the [[clavichord]], [[harp]], [[flageolet]], and flute.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} The nuns played in front of spectators, choirs, and high-ranking government officials.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Musically-adept, underprivileged women were allowed to perform during the nuns' [[Christmas]] recital.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Performances were often "feminine acts", such as sewing, embroidery, bakery, and selling "special confections."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} For two hundred years in Latin America, the "elite woman" was educated in the arts; "the rest" were consigned to cooking, sewing, spinning, weaving, embroidery, and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=167}} In 17th- and 18th-century [[Mexico City]], music was often heard by visitors.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} The music emanated from cathedral choirs, indigenous dancers, or black musicians organized in the city.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} During the 17th century, Europeans and their descendants wrote and performed music at cathedrals in Mexico's cities which was repeated in song by [[black people|blacks]], [[mulatto]]s, indigenous Mexicans, [[Asian people|Asians]], and ethnicities.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=49}} In 1690, Mexican author [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] wrote secular and religious poetry, plays, philosophy, and theology.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} She often discussed topics ranging from mathematics to music with visitors, had no interest in marriage and wanted to pursue "a life of the mind."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} Although her views were suppressed, de la Cruz defended [[women's rights]] in education.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}}

At a 1691 celebration, European traveler Juan de Galde described his participation in dancing and singing and placing a [[scapular]] on two young women in Mexico.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} A Mexican singer named Reina performed for six hours, which made "the event more enjoyable".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|pp=50-51}} The "wild" celebration banned [[Jamaicans]] from entry.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=51}} In 1697, Neapolitan chronicler Gemelli Carreri wrote during his trip off the coast of the [[Dominican Republic]] that he saw a canoe of musicians trying to outdo each other in singing and drawing attention to their "perfection".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} In 1799 [[Buenos Aires]], privileged women were encouraged to educate themselves in the arts.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}} The government required that women be taught to read and write, in addition to physical education and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}}

Since the arrival of European settlers, Latin music has been male-dominated.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Musical training was nonexistent for women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Male predominance in the genre left "power imbalances that acted as barriers to women's participation in Latin music."{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Despite this barrier, women have become successful.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Under the authority of men, they were limited to roles as [[vocalist]]s or dancers rather than [[instrumentalists]], writers, composers, [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} According to musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]], female roles were related to traditional norms; "decent women" cared for their children and remained at home, cleaning and cooking.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Women's dance routines were a growing concern among female fans and performers.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Female dancers, more closely scrutinized than males, were expected to follow "normative gender expectations" and exhibit "appropriate behavior".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Although male dancers typically performed suggestively, women who danced similarly were accused of being "loose" or "slack".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}}

[[File:Celia Cruz 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of Celia Cruz onstage in a fluffy gown|[[Celia Cruz]], who broke barriers against women in [[salsa music]], was instrumental in popularizing the genre.]]
According to author Lise Waxer, Cuban [[trova]] singer [[María Teresa Vera]] is the "great-grandmother of all Latin women singers".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} "Arroz Con Leche" ("Rice Pudding"), which advises the listener to find a spouse who will take care of them, was criticized by [[feminist]] groups.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=37}} [[Bolero]] lyrics have a central theme of women as the object of male desire, [[unrequited love]], and abandonment, portraying women as "physical absence and emotional distance, as ungrateful beings" unequipped to love a man.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cuban singer [[La Lupe]] "pushed the boundaries" of bolero music, and was called the queen of [[Latin soul]] music.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} She toured the U.S. with bandleader [[Tito Puente]], and was one of the most popular Latin performers of the 1960s.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} In her youth she dominated local singing competitions, which inspired her to pursue a career in music despite her parents' desire for her to become a teacher.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} After divorcing her first husband, La Lupe began a solo career and performed in [[Havana]] nightclubs.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her popularity grew, and she owned and operated a nightclub in Cuba which was seized by the [[Cuba under Fidel Castro|Castro government]].{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe emigrated to the United States, settled in New York in 1962 and began touring the country with other bolero and salsa performers.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She released several salsa albums with "devotional lyrics."{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her concert requests began diminishing at the turn of the 1970s as her savings drained because of her second husband's failing health.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She ended her professional career in a wheelchair at a final, 1985 concert with Puente to help pay her medical expenses.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe, who devoted her remaining years to [[Christian music]] in [[the Bronx]], died of [[cardiac arrest]] in February 1992.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Cuban singers [[Rita Montaner]] and [[Celeste Mendoza]] were involved in the "appropriation and rearticulation of [[rhumba|rumba]]", a genre popular before salsa.{{sfn|Poey|2014}}
 
As [[salsa music]] grew in popularity, [[Celia Cruz]] emerged during the 1950s and was known as the queen of the genre.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Although Cruz was instrumental in popularizing and developing male-dominated salsa,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} few other women are associated with it.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} She was the only female singer featured in the British documentary, ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cities'' (1985), which noted the absence of women in the industry.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} According to the documentary, women were "not trained in popular music and that women dared not improvise—''sonear'' (closeness)—on stage".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cruz crossed boundaries set by public expectations for music performed at nightclubs, but she was the exception who proved the rule.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} Opportunities for all-female salsa bands were nonexistent; gender discrimination flourished in the market, and women were seen as "less competent than their male counterparts."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In 1977 Cruz recorded "Usted Abusó", which gave a voice to [[violence against women|battered women]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} The 1980s saw the emergence of [[salsa romántica]], which was "deemed as homogenized, depoliticized, and ultimately, feminized."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}}
 
[[File:Gloriaestefan ahoy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gloria Estefan onstage, singing and holding flowers|In 1993, [[Gloria Estefan]] was the first musician to debut an album atop the ''Billboard'' [[Top Latin Albums]] chart.]]
During the 1990s women began playing a larger role in salsa music,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} increasing the genre's popularity,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} and female salsa singers broke "the sexist boundaries of the [Latin] music industry".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} Although women singers were becoming more popular, images of men were emphasized to the public more than those of women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} [[La India]], Corinne, [[Brenda K. Starr]], [[Lissette Melendez]], and Yolanda la Duke were instrumental in refining salsa in that decade, although all were managed by men.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Their new salsa sound was influenced by African American music ([[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[jazz music|jazz]], and [[soul music|soul]]), which revolutionized traditional 1970s salsa.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} According to author Lise Waxer, a "careful and attentive listening" of their recordings indicated the "female authority and influence—a female genealogy—of salsa music."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|pp=136, 147}} Salsa's leading female singer was [[La India]],{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=412}} who developed salsa romantica music during the 1990s and whose lyrics "turn the tables" on the male salsa narrative of women as objects of desire, "cruel and evil or idealized and unattainable."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In her most-popular song, "[[Ese Hombre (Rocío Jurado song)|Ese Hombre]]" (originally recorded by [[Rocío Jurado]]), La India contradicts male stereotypes.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} The song's lyrics describe a man who is "a fool/stupid and conceited/selfish and capricious", reversing male "discursive terrorism" toward their female partners.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} La India has been compared to Celia Cruz as leaders in their respective eras,{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=413}} and to La Lupe in musical style: "nasal style of singing, growls, and screams that evoke an androgynous style rather than a soft melodious tone."{{sfn|Poey|2014}}

In her Spanish-language debut, [[Gloria Estefan]] released ''[[Mi Tierra]]'' (1993). It was a commercial success, debuting atop the new US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Latin Albums]] chart. Estefan has been described by her [[Latin pop]] contemporaries as performing [[pop ballad]]s and [[soft rock]].{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=113}} She has also ventured into salsa and [[merengue music]], using salsa in her English-language compositions; "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" brought her to European clubs.{{sfn|Broughton|Ellingham|Trillo|1999|p=499}} The rural Cuban genre [[guajira (music)|guajira]] offered a musical identity to [[Afro-Cuban]]s;{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=305}} [[Albita Rodriguez]] became popular, and was named one of the top 100 personalities of the 20th century by ''[[Newsweek (magazine)|Newsweek]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Novas|2007|p=323}} Most of her repertoire are love songs with "openly erotic lyrics" with hetero- and homosexual themes.{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=243}}

The duo of [[Monchy y Alexandra]] "established [[bachata (music)|bachata]] as a [[easy listening|'nice']] music that could be listened to in the home by women and children."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} Women "embraced [the] clean-up"; the romantic bachata style, with emotive lyrics, expressed longing for a lost lover.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} In 1950s bachata music, women were accused of "treachery or promiscuity or, in more humorous moments, referring to [[women sexuality|their sexuality]] and sexual organs with thinly veiled double entendres."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}} The lyrics were rooted in an era where [[women in the workplace]] became more common, displacing men as [[breadwinner]]s.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}}

In 19th-century merengue music, a man "won the love of woman" by dancing.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=34}} Modern merengue (a [[club music|party]] genre) lyrics explored the "vicissitudes of urban life [and] employed skillful wordplay and humorous double entendres about women and sex."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} Because of the genre's "air of male-dominated sexuality", [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] men believed that making merengue music is "no fitting occupation for women."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} According to [[Santo Domingo|Santo Domingans]], listening to merengue music "is only for men" and a woman who enjoys the music is considered "a crazy girl [and] a bad girl."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} During the 1970s, attitudes toward women and merengue music changed with the changing roles of women in Dominican society.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} All-female merengue bands emerged in the 1980s, beginning with [[Las Chicas Del Can]] in 1984.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} Participation in merengue increased in 1990, with women playing [[percussion]] and [[brass]] instruments formerly considered too difficult for women.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}}

Female merengue bands were often formed by successful male merengue musicians, who "often referred to them as the property of the [male musicians who formed them]."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The mainly-female merengue band [[Milly y los Vecinos|Milly, Jocelyn y Los Vecinos]] formed after Las Chicas del Can.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The group became popular, despite not setting out to challenge existing gender roles.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} Feminists have noted the "limited values" in merengue recordings by women, since most of their songs are written by men who "do not resolutely challenge patriarchal attitudes."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=118}} [[Olga Tañón]] was the most successful female merengue artist in the 1990s,{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} and has been called the queen of merengue music.{{sfn|Steingress|2002|p=13}} Tañón has been credited with popularizing merengue in [[Music of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], a salsa-dominated market.{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}} Her 1994 album, ''Siente el Amor'', outsold her previous recordings: ''[[Mujer de Fuego]]'' (1993) and her platinum-certified debut studio album, ''[[Sola]]'' (1992).{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}}

Since the [[history of radio|beginning of radio]] women have been accepted as [[mariachi]] singers, often performing duets with men.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} The Mexican quintet Las Coronelas, formed by María Carlota Noriega during the 1940s, was the first mariachi [[all-female band]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} The first all-female [[ranchera]] band, Las Generales (formed by Elena Muñoz), consisted of wives and mothers of male professional mariachi musicians.{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} The group was criticized by the public for playing in ''[[cantina]]s'' ([[bar]]s),{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} and their partners destroyed their instruments.{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} Other all-female bands tried unsuccessfully to be pioneers.

[[File:Jenni Rivera in Concert.jpg|thumb|alt=Jenni Rivera taking a break during a performance|[[Jenni Rivera]]'s recordings have sparked debate in the [[Latino]] community on women's roles.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=671}}]]
Women finalists at the 2016 [[Billboard Latin Music Awards|''Billboard'' Latin Music Awards]] were outnumbered by men, which was described by the magazine as a "continuing [challenge] facing female artists in Latin music."{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} For 2017 [[International Women's Day]] and [[Women's History Month]], the [[music streaming]] service Spotify curated a playlist of women in Latin music.{{sfn|Flores|2017}} The playlist included music from Selena, Celia Cruz, and [[Natalia Lafourcade]].{{sfn|Flores|2017}} An April 2016 ''Billboard'' report noted the absence of women from the magazine's [[music chart]]s.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} The report found that the last female soloist topped the US [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart four years earlier: Shakira, with [[Maná]] (a male rock en español group), singing "[[Mi Verdad (song)|Mi Verdad]]".{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} In 2012 seven women had number-ones on the Top Latin Albums chart, compared with 33 men.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} ''Billboard'' executive Leila Cobo found that three of the seven women were veterans (Gloria Trevi, Thalía, and [[Ednita Nazario]]), and another three were deceased (Selena, Jenni Rivera, and [[Natalie Cole]].{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} [[Leslie Grace]] was the youngest female singer to reach number one on the [[Latin Airplay]] chart when she was 17 years old,{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} and Alexandra Lioutikoff was the first woman executive vice-president at [[Universal Music Publishing Group]]'s Latin division.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} Asked why the visibility of women in Latin music has declined, [[Chiquis Rivera]] suggested that radio programmers are to blame for their "''machista'' culture."{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} According to Lioutikoff, women (unlike their male counterparts) "rarely collaborate".{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} In its report, ''Billboard'' compiled a list of the top five women with the most number-ones on the Hot Latin Songs; Gloria Estefan led the list with 15, Shakira had 10, Selena seven, Ana Gabriel six, and Paulina Rubio five.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} The magazine found women "underrepresented on the Latin-music-focused ''Billboard'' charts", with Rubio the last female number-one with "Me Gustas Todo" on February 11, 2012.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} A discrepancy existed between the Top Latin Albums and the ''Billboard'' 200 charts; seven women topped the Latin Albums chart, compared to 21 on the ''Billboard'' 200.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}}

Women remain a minority in Puerto Rican music.{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017}} According to Licia Fiol-Matta, the [[music industry]] has a "prejudiced practice of limiting the number of women recording artists" and women singers "did not sell records since women did not buy records."{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017}} In July 2017, Alejandra Guzmán and Gloria Trevi were the first female collaboration in the 24-year history of the Top Latin Albums chart to debut atop the chart.{{sfn|Zellner|2017}} In 2016, Mexican pop singer [[Sofia Reyes]] was the first female lead singer with a number-one single in five years.{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}} Her collaboration with [[Prince Royce]] on "[[Solo Yo]]" was the first number-one single on the [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart by a woman since Jennifer Lopez' "[[On the Floor|Ven A Bailar]]" (2011) with [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]].{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}} Eight women have topped the Latin Pop Songs chart as featured acts, duos or groups with female leads: "Solo Yo" (Sofia Reyes with Prince Royce, April 23, 2016); "Mi Verdad" ([[Maná]], featuring Shakira, April 4, 2015); "[[Corre!]]" ([[Jesse &amp; Joy]], March 31, 2012); "[[Dutty Love]]" ([[Don Omar]] with [[Natti Natasha]], March 24, 2012), "[[Fuiste Tu]]" ([[Ricardo Arjona]] with [[Gaby Moreno]], March 10, 2012); "[[Give Me Everything]]" (Pitbull with [[Ne-Yo]], [[Afrojack]] and [[Nayer]], July 23, 2011), and "Ven A Bailar" (Jennifer Lopez with Pitbull, June 18, 2011).{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Amaya Mendizabal of ''Billboard'' called the decline of women on the Latin music charts "an ongoing trend."{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} In 2015, 22 weeks passed without a female-led single on the 50-position Hot Latin Songs chart.{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} According to Mendizabal, the absence of women on the Latin music charts is "partly attributed to the steady popularity of reggaeton and regional Mexican music, which is often led by male acts."{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Mendizabal wrote that "traditional pop songs" rarely top the Hot Latin Songs chart; four pop songs did so in the previous three years, most by men.{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Sofia Reyes has expressed concern about the lack of women performers at Latin-music awards shows, telling Jeff Benjamin of [[Fuse TV]] that 90 percent of awards-show performers are men.{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}}

In July 2017, Spanish writer Daniela Bose noted the absence of women in Spanish music charts in comparison with those of [[Music of France|France]] and [[Music of Italy|Italy]]; culturally similar to Spain, women were more successful in the latter countries.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose analyzed the [[Spanish Albums Chart|Spanish Albums]] and [[Spanish Singles Chart|Singles Charts]], finding that the only Spanish singers who placed in the top 50 were [[Malú]], [[Vanesa Martin]], Sweet California, [[India Martinez]], and the [[Spanish folk music]] singers [[Mónica Naranjo]] and [[Isabel Pantoja]].{{sfn|Bose|2017}} When Bose expanded her search to the next 50 positions, she found only non-Spanish singers.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She concluded that listeners had replaced Spanish and [[Latin pop]] music with reggaeton and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]], genres performed by men with lyrics belittling women "as meat".{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose found a [[subtext]] in the songs encouraging female [[infidelity]] for sexual reasons, alluding to a non-committed relationship.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} According to Bose, music "is not one of those 'secure' professions [for those who] seek stability"; she found women absent from prominent positions held by men, such as heading a record label, producing concerts, and [[audio engineer]]ing; in these fields, with higher pay and power, women lack "decision-making process[es] that set the path for [the Latin music] industry."{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She ended her report by urging the music industry to avoid gender imbalances in their markets: "What dazzles is the beauty of the final work, regardless of who creates it."{{sfn|Bose|2017}}

A '''work of art''', '''artwork''', '''art piece''', '''piece of art''' or '''art object''' is an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Physical body|physical item]] or [[art]]istic creation. Apart from "work of art", which may be used of any work regarded as [[art]] in its widest sense, including works from [[literature]] and [[music]], these terms apply principally to tangible, portable forms of [[Visual arts|visual art]]: 
*An example of [[fine art]], such as a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]]
*An object that has been designed specifically for its aesthetic appeal, such as a piece of [[jewellery]]
*An object that has been designed for aesthetic appeal as well as functional purpose, as in [[interior design]] and much [[folk art]] 
*An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by [[Culture|cultural]] outsiders)
*A non-ephemeral [[photograph]], [[film]] or visual [[computer program]], such as a [[video game]] or [[computer animation]]
*A work of [[installation art]] or [[conceptual art]].
Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:
*A fine work of [[architecture]] or [[landscape design]]
*A production of live [[performance]], such as [[theater]], [[ballet]], [[opera]], [[performance art]], musical [[concert]] and other [[performing arts]], and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations.

This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as [[aural]]-[[music]] and written word-[[literature]] have similar issues and philosophies.  The term ''[[objet d'art]]'' is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical).  The term '''''oeuvre''''' is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre Oeuvre] Merriam Webster Dictionary, Accessed April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:Jade ornament with grape design.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese [[jade]] ornament with grapes vine (1115–1234 CE)]] 
[[File:Leadlight 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leadlight]] window from the 1920s]]

A ''work of art'' in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent [[aesthetic]] function.  A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger [[art movement]] or artistic [[era]], such as: a [[genre]], aesthetic [[convention (norm)|convention]], [[culture]], or regional-national distinction.&lt;ref name=gell1998/&gt; It can also be seen as an item within an artist's "body of work" or ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]''. The term is commonly used by: [[museum]] and [[cultural heritage management|cultural heritage]] [[curator]]s, the interested public, the [[patronage|art patron]]-private [[art collector]] community, and [[art gallery|art galleries]].&lt;ref name=macdonald2006/&gt;

Physical objects that document immaterial or [[conceptual art]] works, but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some [[Dada]] and [[Neo-Dada]] conceptual and [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] works have received later inclusion. Also, some [[architectural rendering]]s and [[architectural model|model]]s of unbuilt projects, such as by [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[Frank Gehry]], are other examples.

The products of [[environmental design]], depending on intention and execution, can be "works of art" and include: [[land art]], [[site-specific art]], [[architecture]], [[garden]]s, [[landscape architecture]], [[installation art]], [[rock art]], and [[megalith|megalithic monuments]].

Legal definitions of "work of art" are used in [[copyright]] law; ''see {{slink|Visual arts|United States of America copyright definition of visual art}}''.

==Theories==
[[Marcel Duchamp]] critiqued the idea that the work of art should be a unique product of an artist's labour, representational of their technical skill or artistic caprice.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.) 1997, ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Michael Craig-Martin]], creator of ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', said of his work – ''"It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual [[oak|oak tree]] is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/theres-no-need-to-be-afraid-of-the-present-625001.html "There's No Need to be Afraid of the Present"], ''The Independent'', 25 Jun 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|upright|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at his [[291 (art gallery)|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit.]]
Some [[Art criticism|art theorist]]s and writers have long made a distinction between the [[physical art|physical qualities of an art object]] and its identity-status as an artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804100009/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a painting by [[Rembrandt]] has a physical existence as an "oil painting on canvas" that is separate from its identity as a [[masterpiece]] "work of art" or the artist's ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rembrandtresearchproject.org/|title=Rembrandt Research Project - Home|work=rembrandtresearchproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many works of art are initially denied "museum quality" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the [[Impressionists]] and non-representational [[abstract art]]ists are examples. Some, such as the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|"Readymades" of Marcel Duchamp]] including his infamous urinal ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', are later reproduced as museum quality replicas.

There is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between "[[fine art]]" objects made by "[[artist]]s"; and  [[folk art]], [[handicraft|craft-work]], or "[[Applied arts|applied art]]" objects made by "first, second, or third-world" [[designer]]s, [[artisan]]s and [[Artisan|craftspeople]]. Contemporary and archeological [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous art]], [[industrial design]] items in limited or [[mass production]], and places created by [[environmental design]]ers and [[cultural landscape]]s, are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition.
