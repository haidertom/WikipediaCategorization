'''Gloria Jean Watkins''' (born September 25, 1952), better known by her [[pen name]] '''bell hooks''',&lt;ref name="pen-name"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dinitia Smith |title=Tough arbiter on the web has guidance for writers |work=The New York Times |date=September 28, 2006 |page=E3 |quote=But the Chicago Manual says it is not all right to capitalize the name of the writer bell hooks because she insists that it be lower case. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/books/28chic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American author, [[Feminism|feminist]], and [[Activism|social activist]]. The name "bell hooks" is derived from that of her maternal great-grandmother, Bell Blair Hooks.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell, "Inspired Eccentricity: Sarah and Gus Oldham" in Sharon Sloan Fiffer and Steve Fiffer (eds),''Family: American Writers Remember Their Own'', New York: Vintage Books, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;152.{{pb}}
hooks, bell, ''Talking Back'', Routledge, 2014 [1989], p.&amp;nbsp;161.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of hooks' writing has been the [[intersectionality]] of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[capitalism]], and [[gender]], and what she describes as their ability to produce and perpetuate systems of [[oppression]] and class domination. She has published over 30 books and numerous scholarly articles, appeared in [[documentary film]]s, and participated in public lectures. She has addressed race, class, and gender in education, art, history, [[sexuality]], mass media, and [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/He-Ho/Hooks-Bell.html|title=Bell Hooks Biography - life, childhood, children, name, school, mother, young, book, information, born|website=www.notablebiographies.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, she founded the bell hooks Institute at [[Berea College]] in [[Berea, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bellhooksinstitute.com|title=About the bell hooks institute {{!}} bell hooks institute|website=bell hooks institute|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
hooks was born in [[Hopkinsville]], a small, segregated town in [[Kentucky]], to a working-class family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/He-Ho/Hooks-Bell.html|title=Bell Hooks Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Veodis Watkins, was a custodian and her mother, [[Rosa Bell Watkins]], was a homemaker. She had five sisters and one brother. An avid reader, she was educated in [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], and wrote of great adversities when making the transition to an [[Racial integration|integrated]] school, where teachers and students were predominantly white. She later graduated from [[Hopkinsville High School]] in [[Hopkinsville]], [[Kentucky]]. She obtained her BA in English from [[Stanford University]] in 1973, and her [[Master of Arts|MA]] in English from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Significant Contemporary American Feminists: A Biographical Sourcebook|last=Scanlon|first=Jennifer|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0313301254|location=Westport, CT|pages=125–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, after several years of teaching and writing, she completed her doctorate in literature at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], with a [[dissertation]] on author [[Toni Morrison]].

===Career===
hooks' teaching career began in 1976 as an English professor and senior lecturer in Ethnic Studies at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gary L. |last1=Anderson |first2= Kathryn G|last2=Anderson|title=hooks, bell (1952– )|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Reference|pages=704–706|edition=vol. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her three years there, Golemics, a Los Angeles publisher, released her first published work, a [[chapbook]] of poems titled "[[And There We Wept]]" (1978), written under her pen name, "bell hooks". She adopted her maternal great-grandmother's name as a pen name because her great-grandmother "was known for her snappy and bold tongue, which [she] greatly admired". She put the name in lowercase letters "to distinguish [herself from] her great-grandmother." She said that her unconventional lowercasing of her name signifies what is most important is her works: the "substance of books, not who I am."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=bell hooks Speaks Up | author=Heather Williams | website=The Sandspur (2/10/06) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She taught at several post-secondary institutions in the early 1980s and 1990s, including the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Yale]], [[Oberlin College]] and [[City College of New York]].&lt;ref name="gale"&gt;"bell hooks." Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2010. Literature Resource Center. Accessed 12 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[South End Press]] published her first major work, ''[[Ain't I a Woman? (book)|Ain't I a Woman?: Black Women and Feminism]]'' in 1981, though it was written years earlier, while she was an undergraduate student.&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching to Transgress'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades since its publication, ''Ain't I a Woman?'' has gained widespread recognition as an influential contribution to feminist thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Scholar]] shows 894 citations of ''Ain't I a Woman'' (as of August 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ain't I a Woman?'' examines several recurring themes in her later work: the historical impact of sexism and racism on black women, devaluation of black womanhood, media roles and portrayal, the education system, the idea of a [[White supremacy|white-supremacist]]-[[Capitalism|capitalist]]-[[patriarchy]], the [[marginalization]] of black women, and the disregard for issues of race and class within feminism. Since the publication of ''Ain't I a Woman?'', she has become eminent as a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] political thinker and [[cultural critic]]. She targets and appeals to a broad audience by presenting her work in a variety of media using various writing and speaking styles. As well as having written books, she has published in numerous scholarly and mainstream magazines, lectures at widely accessible venues, and appears in various documentaries.[[File:bellhooks.jpg|thumb|bell hooks in 2009|left|247x247px]]She is frequently cited by feminists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Book Review: Feminism is for Everybody by bell hooks | url=http://underneathabook.blogspot.com/2012/02/book-review-feminism-is-for-everybody.html | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=10 Years of "Feminism is for Everybody" | url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/09/07/10-years-of-feminism-is-for-everybody/ | website=Ms. Magazine Blog (2010 September 7) | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Feminism is for Everybody: Further Discussion | url=http://feministclassics.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/feminism-is-for-everybody-further-discussion/ | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; as having provided the best solution to the difficulty of defining something as diverse as "feminism", addressing the problem that if feminism can mean everything, it means nothing. She asserts an answer to the question "what is feminism?" that she says is "rooted in neither fear nor fantasy... 'Feminism is a movement to end [[sexism]], sexist exploitation and oppression{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;bell hooks, ''Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics'', Pluto Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has published more than 30 books, ranging in topics from black men, [[patriarchy]], and [[masculinity]] to self-help, engaged [[pedagogy]] to personal [[memoirs]], and sexuality (in regards to feminism and politics of aesthetic/[[visual culture]]). A prevalent theme in her most recent writing is the community and communion, the ability of loving communities to overcome race, class, and gender inequalities. In three conventional books and four children's books, she suggests that communication and literacy (the ability to read, write, and think critically) are crucial to developing healthy communities and relationships that are not marred by race, class, or gender inequalities.

She has held positions as Professor of [[African-American studies|African-American Studies]] and English at [[Yale University]], Associate Professor of [[Women's studies|Women's Studies]] and American Literature at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], Ohio, and as Distinguished Lecturer of English Literature at the [[City College of New York]].

In 2002, hooks gave a [[commencement speech]] at [[Southwestern University]]. Eschewing the congratulatory mode of traditional commencement speeches, she spoke against what she saw as government-sanctioned violence and oppression, and admonished students who she believed went along with such practices. This was followed by a controversy described in the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' after an "irate Arizonian"&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web | title=bell hooks Digs In | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2002-05-24/93217/ | author=Lauri Apple | website=The Austin Chronicle (May 24, 2002) | accessdate =December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; had criticized the speech in a letter to the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Postmarks - Southwestern Graduation Debacle | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/columns/2002-05-24/93184/ | website=The Austin Chronicle (May 24, 2002) | accessdate =December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper reported that many in the audience booed the speech, though "several graduates passed over the provost to shake her hand or give her a hug".&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt;

In 2004, she joined [[Berea College]] in [[Berea, Kentucky|Berea]], Kentucky, as Distinguished Professor in Residence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/people/default.asp Berea.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528042644/http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/people/default.asp |date=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she participated in a weekly feminist discussion group, "Monday Night Feminism"; a luncheon lecture series, "Peanut Butter and Gender"; and a seminar, "Building Beloved Community: The Practice of Impartial Love".

Her 2008 book, ''belonging: a culture of place'', includes a candid interview with author [[Wendell Berry]] as well as a discussion of her move back to [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/belonging-a-culture-of-place/oclc/228676700&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Belonging: a culture of place|last=Hooks|first=bell|date=2009-01-01|isbn=9780415968157|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has undertaken three scholar-in-residences at [[The New School]]. Mostly recently she did one for a week in October 2014. She engaged in public dialogues with [[Gloria Steinem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vagianos|first1=Alanna|title=Gloria Steinem On The Great Part Of Feminism: 'We Have Each Other's Backs'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/07/gloria-steinem-bell-hooks-the-new-school_n_5945588.html|accessdate=October 11, 2014|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laverne Cox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scherker|first1=Amanda|title=Laverne Cox And bell hooks Talk How To Survive The Patriarchy|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/08/bell-hooks-laverne-cox_n_5952780.html?ir=Women|accessdate=October 11, 2014|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cornel West]].

==Influences==
Those who have influenced hooks include African-American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and feminist [[Sojourner Truth]] (whose speech ''Ain't I a Woman?'' inspired her first major work), Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]] (whose perspectives on education she embraces in her theory of engaged pedagogy), Peruvian [[theologian]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], psychologist [[Erich Fromm]], playwright [[Lorraine Hansberry]], [[Buddhist]] monk [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], African-American writer [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], Guyanese historian [[Walter Rodney]], African-American [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]], and African-American [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] (who addresses how the strength of love unites communities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iapl.info/CONFERENCE_HISTORY/IAPL_2001/iapl_2001_keynote_speaker.htm Notes on IAPL 2001 Keynote Speaker, bell hooks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131175411/http://www.iapl.info/CONFERENCE_HISTORY/IAPL_2001/iapl_2001_keynote_speaker.htm |date=January 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1844 Building a Community of Love, bell hooks &amp; Thich Nhat Hanh]&lt;/ref&gt; hooks says of Martin Luther King Jr.'s notion of a beloved community, "He had a profound awareness that the people involved in oppressive institutions will not change from the logics and practices of domination without engagement with those who are striving for a better way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Beloved Community: A Conversation between bell hooks and George Brosi|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/appalachian_heritage/v040/40.4.brosi03.html|journal = Appalachian Heritage|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1940-5081|pages = 76–86|volume = 40|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/aph.2012.0109|first = George|last = Brosi|first2 = Bell|last2 = Hooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom'' ==
In her 1994 book ''Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom,'' hooks writes about a transgressive approach in education where educators can teach students to "transgress" against racial, sexual, and class boundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom. To educate as the practice of freedom, bell hooks describes it as "a way of teaching in which anyone can learn."&lt;ref name="1952- 11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/877868009|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|isbn=9781135200015|location=New York|pages=11|oclc=877868009|date=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks combines her practical knowledge and personal experiences of the classroom with feminist thinking and critical pedagogy. Hooks investigates the classroom as a source of constraint but also a potential source of liberation. She argues that teachers' use of control and power over students dulls the students' enthusiasm and teaches obedience to authority, "confin[ing] each pupil to a rote, assembly-line approach to learning."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Teaching to Transgress'' 12)&lt;/ref&gt; She advocates that universities should encourage students and teachers to transgress, and seeks ways to use collaboration to make learning more relaxing and exciting. She describes teaching as a performative act and teachers as catalysts that invite everyone to become more engaged and activated. Performative aspect of learning "offers the space for change, invention, spontaneous shifts, that can serve as a catalyst drawing out the unique elements in each classroom."&lt;ref name="1952- 11"/&gt; Hooks also dedicated a chapter of the book to [[Paulo Freire]], written in a form of a playful dialogue between herself, Gloria Watkins and her writing voice, bell hooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30668295|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415908085|location=New York|pages=45–59|oclc=30668295}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last chapter of the book, hooks raised the critical question of eros or the erotic in classrooms environment. According to hooks, eros and the erotics do not need to be denied for learning to take place. She argues that one of the central tenets of [[feminist pedagogy]] has been to subvert the [[Mind–body dualism|mind-body dualism]] and allow oneself as a teacher to be whole in the classroom, and as a consequence wholehearted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30668295|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415908085|location=New York|pages=193|oclc=30668295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope'' ==
In 2004, ten years after the success of Teaching to Transgress, bell hooks published ''Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope''. In this book, hooks offers advice about how to continue to make the classroom a place that is life-sustaining and mind expanding, a place of liberating mutuality where teacher and student together work in partnership.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/846494699|title=Teaching community : a pedagogy of hope|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135457921|location=New York|pages=XV|oclc=846494699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks writes that education as a practice of freedom enable us to confront feelings of loss and restore our sense of connections and consequently teaches us how to create community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Hooks locates hope in places of struggle where she witnessed individuals positively transforming their lives and the world around them. For hooks educating is always a vocation rooted in hopefulness.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==''All About Love: New Visions''==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|{{BLP sources section|date=February 2017}}
{{BLP primary sources|section|date=April 2018}}}}
After many disputes with ex-boyfriends about the nature of love, bell hooks published ''[[All About Love: New Visions]]'' in 2000. She explains how her past two long-term boyfriends were foiled by "patriarchal thinking" and sexist gender roles, so neither relationship ever really had a chance. She continuously wanted to recommend a book for the men to read, but could not find one that would clearly make her point to support her argument. For this reason, she decided to write her own, which would go into depth about her true feelings towards love.
	
In this book, hooks combines her personal life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes the way in which love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition.&lt;ref name="hooks 2001 4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then we would all be happier.&lt;ref name="hooks 2001 4"/&gt; Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, "So many people think that it's enough to say what they feel, even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2000/2/hooks/index.html|title=CNN - bell hooks|website=edition.cnn.com|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.

bell hooks began her book with a series of spiritual messages, which include biblical verses to support her definition of love. She claims that a standard definition of love must include spiritual growth for one's self and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she refers to biblical messages, she does not promote religion in her book; on the contrary, she encourages spiritual thinking. Hooks identifies flaws with relationships nowadays since there is a loose understanding about love. She shares personal experiences about fearing rejection and emotional pain. As a result, she acknowledges lacking full commitment and expressing vulnerability because of the fear of not receiving those things in return, so giving care and affection are the minimal expectations she had in her relationships. However, those love components were not enough. Hooks introduces the necessity of practicing self-love and care to sustain healthy relationship with a concrete understanding of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, this book sheds some light on what hooks sees as the modern day abandonment of love and what it means for people of today to experience love. One argument she proposes is how love cannot exist in the middle of a power struggle. Hooks goes as far as to present a number of problems she finds with our modern ideals of love and proposes their possible solutions. She includes the propositions of full reconstruction and transformation of modern-day love based on "affection, respect, recognition, commitment, trust and care" (Nonfiction Book Review). Hooks also points out what she sees to be the roots of the problems regarding modern day love, those being gender stereotypes, domination, control, ego, and aggression (Nonfiction Book Review).

Another argument hooks discusses is one in which she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit into the tiny boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been socialized to mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught that the most important thing she can do is change herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into men and women who are convinced that lies are the way to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another central argument in hooks's ''All About Love'' is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and this is what she is arguing throughout her book.

Bell hooks wrote this book to inform the world how we can change the way we think about love, our culture, and one another. She teaches us ways to love in a face of a planet of love-lessness. Her New Visions demonstrate how love is possible, and stress that all love is important—romantic, friendship, our love of strangers, and community.

==''Feminist Theory''==
Noting a lack of diverse voices in popular [[feminist theory]], bell hooks published the book ''[[Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center]]'' in 1984. In this book, she argues that those voices have been marginalized, and states: "To be in the margin is to be part of the whole but outside the main body."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', xvi)&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks argued that if feminism seeks to make women equal to men, then it is impossible because in Western society, not all men are equal. She claimed, "Women in lower class and poor groups, particularly those who are non-white, would not have defined [[women's liberation]] as women gaining social equality with men since they are continually reminded in their everyday lives that all women do not share a common social status."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'')&lt;/ref&gt;

She used the work as a platform to offer a new, more inclusive feminist theory. Her theory encouraged the long-standing idea of sisterhood but advocated for women to acknowledge their differences while still accepting each other. Hooks challenged feminists to consider gender's relation to race, class, and sex, a concept known as [[intersectionality]]. She also argues for the importance of male involvement in the equality movement, stating that, in order for change to occur, men must do their part. Hooks also calls for a restructuring of the cultural framework of power, one that does not find oppression of others necessary.&lt;ref&gt;(hooks,92)&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of this restructuring involves allowing men into the feminist movement, so that there is not a separationist ideology, so much as an incorporating camaraderie. Additionally, she shows great appreciation for the movement away from feminist thought as led by bourgeois white women, and towards a multidimensional gathering of both genders to fight for the raising up of women. This shifts the original focus of feminism away from victimization, and towards harboring understanding, appreciation, and tolerance for all genders and sexes so that all are in control of their own destinies, uncontrolled by patriarchal, capitalist tyrants.&lt;ref&gt;(hooks,74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another part of restructuring the movement comes from education; bell hooks points out that there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer like the rest of the masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.

In "Rethinking The Nature of Work", bell hooks goes beyond discussing work and raises a pertinent question that feminists may need to ask themselves. "Many Women active in feminist movement do not have radical political perspectives and are unwilling to face these realities, especially when they, as individuals, gain economic self-sufficiency within the existing structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminist Theory : From Margin to Center|last = hooks|first = bell|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 1984|isbn = 978-0-89608-614-2|location = London|pages = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media theory===
In her book ''Reel to Real'', hooks discusses the effect that movies have on any given individual, with specific emphasis on the black female spectator. She argues that, although we know that movies are not real life, "no matter how sophisticated our strategies of critique and intervention, [we] are usually seduced, at least for a time, by the images we see on the screen. They have power over us, and we have no power over them."{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

Hooks focuses on problematic racial representations. Bell hooks has written a number of essays and articles, and in ''Reel to Real'' she describes her experiences growing up watching mainstream movies as well as engaging in the media. Hooks believes that to engage in film was to engage in the negation of black female representation in the media.{{sfn|hooks|1996}} hooks states, "Representation is the 'hot' issue right now because it's a major realm of power for any system of domination. We keep coming back to the question of representation because identity is always about representation".{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

===Film theory===
Asserting that for her, the "gaze" had always been political, bell hooks explains how growing up she began to grow curious as to how much influence black parents were given as a result of black slaves being punished for looking at their white owners. She wondered how much had been absorbed and carried on through the generations to shift not only parenting, but spectatorship as well.{{sfn|hooks|1996}} In what is described as an "oppositional gaze", hooks explains the sometimes overwhelming desire to look and thus stating that by looking, actually declares a defiantly, "Not only will I stare, I want my look to change reality."{{sfn|hooks|1996}} The cinema became a place of critical analysis and a place where black men could view narratives starring white women without the risk of being lynched or murdered for being perceived as a threat.{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

==Criticism==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2017}}

Although much of the criticism aimed at hooks is in regard to politics, liberals and conservatives alike have critiqued her informal style of writing.{{Original research inline|date=May 2017}} After the release of her first book, ''Ain't I a Woman: Black Women in Feminism'', hooks's writing was criticized as "ahistorical [and] unscholarly"; many{{Who|date=May 2017}} complained about the absence of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell-Scott|first=Patricia|title=The Centrality of Marginality|journal=The Women's Review of Books|date=1985|volume=2|issue=5|page=3|doi=10.2307/4019632|jstor=4019632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks does not provide a bibliography for any of her work, making it difficult to find the editors and publication information for the pieces listed under the "notes" section of her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettis|first=Joyce|title=A Review of Feminist Theory: From Margin To Center|journal=Journal of Women in Culture and Society|date=1986|volume=11|issue=4|pages=788–789|doi=10.1086/494279}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In "Theory as Liberatory Practice," hooks explains that her lack of conventional academic format was "motivated by the desire to be inclusive, to reach as many readers as possible in as many different locations as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haley|first=Shelly|title=Practicing Freedom|journal=The Women's Review of Books|date=1995|volume=7|issue=6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Remembered Rapture: The Writer at Work; By bell hooks; Mother to Mother," Nicole Abraham criticizes hooks's unconventional format rationalization. Abraham suggests that, if her rationalization for not providing footnotes and bibliographic information in her writing is that it will help her reach a broader (presumably a less academic) audience, hooks either assumes the average person has "no real interest or knowledge about who really wrote what ideas and where we can look for more thoughts on similar subjects" or "she mean[s] that we are lazy readers who have not the sophistication to grapple with the complications of an endnote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Nicole|title=Remembered Rapture: The Writer at Work; by bell hooks; Mother to Mother; by Sindiwe Magona|journal=Southern African Feminist Review|date=1999|volume=3|issue=2|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biographical evaluation''' ({{lang-ar|عِلْمُ الرِّجال|`Ilm al-Rijāl}}), literally meaning'' 'Knowledge of Men' ''but more commonly understood as the ''Science of Narration'', refers to a discipline of [[Islam|Islamic]] religious studies within [[hadith terminology]] in which the narrators of [[hadith]] are evaluated. Its goal is to distinguish [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]] and [[Hadith terminology#Hasan|reliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] from [[Hadith terminology#Da'if|unreliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] in establishing the credibility of the narrators, using both historic and religious knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 101, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; ''`Ilm ar-rijal'' is synonymous with what is commonly referred to as ''al-jarḥ wa al-taʻdīl'' (discrediting and accrediting) – the criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators.{{#tag:ref|Al-[[al-Suyuti|Suyūṭī]] mentioned in the chapter of ''Tadrib al-Rawi'' entitled 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable': "''al-Jarḥ wa al-Taʻdīl'' is permissible..."&lt;ref name= "tadrib" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name= "tadrib"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', vol. 2, p. 495, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=[[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;}}

In his ''[[Introduction to the Science of Hadith]]'', [[Ibn al-Salah]], a renowned [[hadith]] specialist, explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators. Introducing the chapter entitled, 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable,' [[Ibn al-Salah]] said, "This is from the most distinguished and noble types (of hadith study) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness."&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, published with ''Muhasin al-Istilah'' by al-Bulqini, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 654, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; He then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the "maintenance of the [[Sharia]]h, purging it of any mistakes or misinformation".&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

Stressing the importance of biographical evaluation, [[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."{{#tag:ref|The other half of knowledge, according to Ibn al-Madini, is "having understanding of the meanings of hadith".&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam"&gt;''Siyar 'Alam al-Nubala’'', by [[al-Dhahabi]], vol. 11, p. 48, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, 11th edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The following [[Qur'an]]ic verse established a general principal in '''biographical evaluation''':&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt; "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"/&gt;}}

===Beginning of narrator evaluation===
The [[Qur'an]]ic verses are numerous that praise the Companions and criticize the hypocrites, both as a group and specific individuals from amongst them–as well as criticism of specific individuals other than the hypocrites. The most well-known of these is a verse of the Quran stating, "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"&gt;The [[Qur'an|Quran]], ''Surah al-Hujarat'', 6th verse.&lt;/ref&gt; While this verse was revealed regarding a particular individual, it is a general principle. Following this example, were the Prophet and then His [[Sahaba|Companions]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"&gt;''ʻIlm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', by al-Mu'allimee, pp. 18–20, Dar al-Rayah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time of the Companions===
While many [[Sahaba|Companions]] narrated [[hadith]], according to [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar|Abdullah ibn Umar]], [[Aisha]], [[Jabir ibn Abd-Allah|Jabir ibn Abdullah]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and [[Anas ibn Malik]] with [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] being the most prolific of them.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 492, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Salah]] the most prolific narrators from the [[Sahaba|Companions]] was [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] followed by [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"/&gt;

In spite of the Companions' efforts in narrating their [[hadith]], there was no need for them to evaluate each other's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the [[Sahaba|Companions]] to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Kifayah'', by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, p. 46, ''Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah'', Beirut, Lebanon, 1988; this edition is apparently based upon the original Indian printing.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the [[Tabi'un|Followers]] with some criticism of specific individuals from them.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

===After the Companions===
As for the [[Tabi'un|Followers]], the generation following the [[Sahaba|Companions]], their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for [[Hadith terminology#Mawdo|fabricating hadith]], but, instead, due to heresy, such as the [[Kharijites]], or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

Evaluating the narrators of [[hadith]] began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad [[Ibn Sirin]], "They did not previously inquire about the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|''isnad]]''. However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, 'Name for us your narrators.' So the people of the [[Sunnah]] would have their hadith accepted and the people of [[Bid‘ah|innovation]] would not."&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Muslim in the introduction to his [[Sahih Muslim|''Sahih]]'', vol. 1, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''turmoil'' referred to is the conflicting ideologies of the Kharijites and extreme [[Shia Islam|Shias]] that had emerged at the time of the third ''khalifas'' [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, [[Ali]] and [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the explanation provided by al-Qurtubi in ''al-Mufhim'', vol. 1, pgs. 122-3 as quoted in ''Qurrah Ayn Al-Muhtaj'', vol. 2, pg 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Bidayah wa Al-Nihayah'', by [[Ibn Kathir]], vol. 10, p. 323, ''Dar Alam al-Kutub''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following generation, [[Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in|that after the Followers]], and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

====Early specialists====
According to [[Ibn al-Salah]], quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of [[hadith]] narrators was [[Shuʿba Ibn al-Ḥajjāj]], followed by Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan and then [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and [[Yahya ibn Ma'in]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"/&gt; Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: [[Ali ibn al-Madini]] and 'Amr ibn 'Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah]] as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

== Overview ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision.}}

===Narrator criteria===
A [[hadith]] is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]]; if there is [[Hadith terminology#Categories of discontinuity|discontinuity]] between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the [[hadith terminology]] article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]] of a particular hadith.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', by Ibn Ḥajr, published as ''an-Nukat'', p. 108, ''Dar Ibn al-Jawzi'', Dammam, Saudi Arabia, sixth edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]] narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|''sahih]]'' constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (''al-ʻadālah''), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (''al-taqwā'') and maintaining proper social graces (''al-murūʼah''). The second, precision (''al-ḍabṭ''), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (''ḍabṭ al-ṣadr'') refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (''ḍabṭ al-kitāb'') is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grounds for criticism===
The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity:
# A narrator intentionally lying, claiming a statement to be a Prophetic [[hadith]] when it is not. The inclusion of a narrator of a hadith as such renders that hadith [[Hadith terminology#Maw.E1.B8.8D.C5.AB.CA.BB|fabricated (''Mawḍūʻ'')]].
# An accusation of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating from the direction (as it pertains to that hadith's chain of narration) of that individual. Or, that a narrator is known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith.
# Plenitude of mistakes in a narrator's hadith.
# Lack of attention to accuracy.
# The commission of wrongdoing by statement or action as long as it does not constitute apostasy.
# Misconception due to narrating on the basis of misunderstanding.
# Contradiction of that narrator's hadith of another established narrator.
# Unspecification of that narrator's standing in their narrating capabilities.
# [[Bid‘ah|Heresy]], being the belief in an innovated matter that contradicts the established religious practice originating with the Prophet due to a misconception, not obstinateness.
# Poor memory, differing from number three above in that the mistakes of that narrator outnumber instances in which they are correct.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', pgs. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of evaluation===
[[Hadith]] scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following:
# Observing that narrator's religiosity and asking others about it.
# Requesting the narrator in question to narrator from a particular living scholar and then returning to that scholar and comparing his narrations with those of the narrator under examination.
# If the narrator narrates from a deceased scholar, inquiring when he, the narrator in question, was born, when he met that scholar and where and then comparing the dates provided in his response to the recognized dates of that scholars death and travels. So, perhaps, the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates, for example, claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar.
# Comparing the narrations of the narrator with those of narrators of established reliability, comparing them seeking any distinctions that might be unique to that narrator, in particular, while contradicting the others.
# Examination of the narrations either written or memorized by that narrator after the passage of time observing any discrepancies with their initial narrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Ilm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', pp. 22–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deliberately altering the wording of a hadith or more for the purpose of examining the ability of the narrator being examined to detect those alterations. This is considered an acceptable practice as long as those alterations are brought to light following the examination process.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', [ 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation terminology ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator...}}

As a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (''taʻdīl'') and those that constitute criticism (''jarḥ''). [[al-Suyuti|al-Suyūṭī]] gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that [[al-Dhahabi]] and [[Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi]] added an additional level and [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', by al-Suyūṭī, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', Riyadh, first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of praise===
#[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] held that the highest level of praise was expressed was through the use of the superlative, for example, ''the most established of the people'' (''athbat al-nās''), or ''the most reliable of the people'' (''awthaq al-nās'').
#Al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi were of the opinion that the highest level was the repetition of adjective, or adjectives, in praising a narrator. For example, ''reliably reliable'' (''thiqah thiqah''), or ''reliable, firm'' (''thiqah thabt'').
#The highest level according to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah the highest is the use of a single adjective in describing a narrator. Examples of this are: ''reliable'' (''thiqah''), ''precise'' (''mutqin'') or ''firm'' (''thabt'').
#''Trustworthy'' (''ṣadūq'') and ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') are both examples of the next category to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah while al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi consider the latter term to be from the next level.
#Next is ''respectable'' ([[Sheikh#Religious usage|''shaykh]]'') along with ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') according to some. This level would also be inclusive of an individual accused of heresy.
#The lowest of the levels of praise is, for example, ''satisfactory in hadith'' (''ṣāliḥ al-ḥadīth''), meaning according to [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]], this includes ''acceptable'' (''maqbūl'') meaning, when supported by other narrators.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As he explained in the introduction to ''Taqrib al-Tahthib'', pp. 14, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, first edition, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of criticism===
#The least severe level for the criticism of a narrator is ''soft in hadith'' (''layyin al-ḥadīth'') and, according to al-'Iraqi, ''they have spoken about him'' (''takallamū fīhi''). This level would also be taken into consideration as a corroborating narrator, but at a level less than the lowest level of praise.
#Next is ''he is not strong'' (''laysa bi l-qawī''). The hadith of a narrator determined to be at this level would also be taken into consideration, as with the previous level, however, this narrator is weaker than one of the previous level.
#More severe than ''he is not strong'' is ''weak in hadith'' (''ḍaʻīf al-ḥadīth''), however, none of these first three categories are rejected outright.
#The fourth of the levels of severity of criticism includes terms such as: ''his hadith is rejected'' (''rudd al-ḥadīth'') and ''very weak'' (''ḍaʻīf jiddan'').
#The fifth includes terms such as: ''his hadith is abandoned'' (''matrūk al-ḥadīth'') and ''destroyed'' (''hālik'').
#From the most severe level of terms of criticism are: ''compulsive liar'' (''kadhdhāb''), ''he lies'' (''yakdhib'') and ''fabricator'' (''waḍḍāʻ'') among other terms.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">When studying [[literature]], '''biography and its relationship to literature''' is often a subject of [[literary criticism]], and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use [[biography]] or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: '''literary biography''' and [[biographical criticism]]. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, [[biographical novel|biographical fiction]] and [[autofiction|autobiographical fiction]].

==Literary biography==
A literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt;&lt;ref name = karl&gt;Karl, Frederick R. "Joseph Conrad" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 69–88&lt;/ref&gt; Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113/&gt; This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref name = karl/&gt;

Literary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of [[Wilfrid Blunt]], noted, "Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use."&lt;ref name= longford&gt;Longford, Elizabeth "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt" of Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, "Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste.... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends."&lt;ref name = meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey "Introduction" in Meyers (ed.) ''The Craft'', pp 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-received literary biographies include [[Richard Ellmann]]'s ''James Joyce'' and [[George Painter]]'s ''Marcel Proust''.&lt;ref name = backschneider1113&gt;Backschneider 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = meyers/&gt;

==Biographical criticism==
{{main|Biographical criticism}}
Biographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Benson| first = Jackson J| year = 1989| jstor = 25111810| title = Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism| journal = College Literature| issue = 16| volume = 29| pages = 107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical fiction==
{{see also|Biographical novel|Biographical film}}
Biographical fiction is a type of [[historical fiction]] that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for "truthful" representation is less strict than in [[biography]]. 

The various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[Lincoln (novel)|Lincoln]]''. Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s ''[[To the Hermitage]]'' and [[Michael Cunningham]]'s ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]''. No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.&lt;ref name="mullan" /&gt;

Biographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people,  but without direct reference to them, such as [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'' (1885) and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.&lt;ref name = mullan&gt;{{cite news| title = Heavy on the source John Mullan analyses The Master by Colm Tóibín.

==Autobiographical fiction==
{{main|Autofiction}}
{{see also|Autobiographical novel|Autobiographical comics}}
Autobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.&lt;ref name = bragg&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5668638.ece| newspaper = The Sunday Times| date = 8 February 2009| title = Melvyn Bragg on autobiographical fiction| accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STATUE OF BLONDELL NEAR DURNSTEIN IN THE WACHAU VALLEY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Statue of Blondel near [[Durnstein]]]]
'''Blondel de Nesle''' – either '''Jean I of Nesle''' (c. 1155 – 1202) or his son '''Jean II of Nesle''' (died 1241) – was a [[France|French]] [[trouvère]].

The name 'Blondel de Nesle' is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. He was identified in 1942, by [[Holger Dyggve]], as Jean II of Nesle (near [[Amiens]]), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the [[Fourth Crusade]]; he later fought in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. However, in 1994, [[Yvan Lepage]] suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the [[Third Crusade]], which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]].

If the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. (The melody of "L'amours dont sui espris" is used in ''[[Carmina Burana]]'', for the song "Procurans Odium"). His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times.

==Legend==
By 1260, Blondel's name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised ''Récits d'un Ménestrel de Reims''; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the [[minstrel]] Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king's escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at [[Dürnstein]]; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard's location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.

'Blondel' is a common [[surname]] on the [[Channel Island]] of [[Guernsey]]. It is recorded that King Richard granted a [[fief]] on the island to a [[vassal]] named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère.

==Modern versions==
The legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the [[Middle Ages]], but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Richard Coeur-de-lion (opera)|Richard Coeur-de-lion]]'' (1784). In 1822, [[Eleanor Anne Porden]] used the legend in her epic poem ''Cœur De Lion'': in her version, Blondel is really Richard's wife, [[Berengaria of Navarre]], in disguise.

A poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled Blondel's Lied was set to music by [[Robert Schumann]].

Throughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists,  placed a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. [[Norah Lofts]] in ''The Lute Player'' (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly ) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel's  heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard's neglected wife Berengaria. 

In the 1962–63 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] British television series ''[[Richard the Lionheart (TV series)|Richard the Lionheart]]'', Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by [[Iain Gregory]].

The English acoustic band of the early 1970s, [[Amazing Blondel]], was named after Blondel.

The legend inspired ''[[Blondel (musical)|Blondel]]'', a 1983 [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Stephen Oliver (composer)|Stephen Oliver]] and [[Tim Rice]]. The play, a comedic [[rock opera]], is set during the period of the [[Third Crusade]]. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director [[Patrick Wilde]] to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3344">The '''Blue Sky Rangers''' is a group of [[Intellivision]] game programmers who previously worked for [[Mattel]] in the early 1980s.

When the Intellivision first came out in 1978, its games were all developed by an outside firm, [[APh Technological Consulting]]. Realizing that potential profits are much greater with [[first party software]], Mattel formed its own in-house software development group. The original five members of that Intellivision team were manager [[Gabriel Baum]], [[Don Daglow]], [[Rick Levine]], [[Mike Minkoff]] and [[John Sohl]]. Levine and Minkoff (a long-time Mattel Toys veteran) both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team.  To keep these and later programmers (the Mattel team peaked at 110 people in 1983) from being hired away by rival [[Atari]], their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret.

In 1982, ''[[TV Guide]]'' published an article about Intellivision's secret programming team. The writer of the article wanted to come up with some group name other than "The Application Software Programmers," so he came up with the name "The Blue Sky Rangers." This was based on the programming group's "Blue Sky Meetings," which were a series of brainstorming sessions for new game ideas.&lt;ref name="TVGuide" /&gt;

This name stuck and the programmers were (and still are) collectively referred to as the Blue Sky Rangers. One of the early programmers, Keith Robinson, re-acquired the rights to Intellivision in recent years and the Blue Sky Rangers' games are now available on a variety of computers and video game platforms, as well as [[mobile phones]]. Rights are currently held by Tommy Tallarico.&lt;ref name="Techspot"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Video game music veteran Tommy Tallarico acquires Intellivision rights from Mattel | first = Jeffrey | last  = Cal | date  = May 29, 2018 | magazine = [[Techspot]] | url   = https://www.techspot.com/news/74844-video-game-music-veteran-tommy-tallarico-acquires-intellivision.html | accessdate = August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13666">{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon witnesses''' are a group of contemporaries of [[Joseph Smith]] who saw the [[golden plates]] from which Smith translated the [[Book of Mormon]]. The most significant witnesses are the [[Three Witnesses]] and the [[Eight Witnesses]], all of whom allowed their names to be used on two separate statements included with the Book of Mormon. Each of the witnesses never denied what they saw.

==Three Witnesses==
{{Main|Three Witnesses}}

The '''Three Witnesses''' were a group of three early leaders of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] who wrote in a statement of 1830 that an [[angel]] had shown them the [[golden plates]] from which [[Joseph Smith]] translated the [[Book of Mormon]] and that they had heard God's voice testifying that the book had been translated by the power of God.

The Three Witnesses were [[Oliver Cowdery]], [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], and [[David Whitmer]], whose joint testimony, in conjunction with a separate statement by [[Eight Witnesses]], has been printed with nearly every edition of the Book of Mormon since its first publication in 1830. All three witnesses eventually broke with Smith and were excommunicated from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|church]].&lt;ref&gt;"All three witnesses eventually quarreled with Joseph and left his church. At their going he heaped abuse upon them, but none ever denied the reality of his vision, and Cowdery and Harris eventually were rebaptized. Joseph had no fear in vilifying them; he neither expected nor received reprisals.

==Eight Witnesses==
{{Main|Eight Witnesses}}
The '''Eight Witnesses''' were the second of the two groups of "special witnesses" to the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon's]] [[golden plates]]. They were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: [[Christian Whitmer]], [[Jacob Whitmer]], [[Peter Whitmer, Jr.]], [[John Whitmer]], [[Hiram Page]], [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], [[Hyrum Smith]], and [[Samuel Harrison Smith]].  Joseph Smith Sr. was Joseph's father, and Hyrum and Samuel H. Smith were his brothers.  Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were David Whitmer's brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lyman Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 79: "Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive....The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph—and God—answering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified they were shown the plates by [[Joseph Smith]] rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses. Christian Whitmer died in 1835 and his brother Peter Whitmer, Jr. died the following year. In 1838, the surviving Whitmers became estranged from Joseph Smith during a leadership struggle in [[Far West, Missouri]], and all were excommunicated with other dissenters,&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 337,339, 350–51. On June 17, [[Sidney Rigdon]] "preached a vitriolic sermon based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot....Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably [[Danites]] by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders....Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled." (355–51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[William E. M'Lellin]]. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should "write and keep a regular history" of the church (D&amp;C 47). Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, ''From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; never to rejoin Smith's church. None of the Eight Witnesses is known to have denied his testimony to the authenticity of Book of Mormon or the golden plates.

==Another witness==
{{main|Mary Whitmer}}

[[Mary Whitmer|Mary Musselman Whitmer]] (1778–1856), the mother of five Witnesses who took care of the household in [[Fayette, New York]], where much of the translation occurred, said that an angel showed her the plates and thus made her more content to continue her daily labors.&lt;ref&gt;"David Whitmer Interview with Edward Stevenson, 9 February 1888,"in [[Dan Vogel]], ''Early Mormon Documents'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2003), 5: 160–61; John C. Whitmer Interview with Andrew Jenson and Edward Stevenson, 11 October 1888," in ''EMD'' 5: 260–62.  John Whitmer said that his grandmother always referred to the supernatural visitor as "Brother Nephi."&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph Smith made no mention of this visitation in his journal.

==Responses==
===Criticism===

Critics of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]—from late nineteenth-century clergymen to [[Mark Twain]] to modern agnostics, evangelical Christians, and even some unorthodox ("Big Tent") Mormons—argue that the testimonies of the witnesses cannot be taken at face value.

* According to [[Grant Palmer]], the Book of Mormon witnesses had a "nineteenth-century magical mindset" rather than "a rationalist perspective." They believed in what was called "second sight.  Traditionally, this included the ability to see spirits and their dwelling places within the local hills and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;[[Grant H. Palmer]], ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 175. Palmer devotes an entire chapter to the magical mindset of the Book of Mormon Witnesses.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of the witnesses possessed and used [[Scrying|seer stone]]s; Oliver Cowdery was a [[Dowsing|rodsman]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Michael Quinn, ''Early Mormonism and the Magic World View'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1998), rev. ed., 239-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Tufts University professor [[John L. Brooke]] has observed, many of the earliest Mormons were "very much attuned to the supernatural powers of witchcraft."&lt;ref&gt;John L. Brooke, ''The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644–1844'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Far removed from our own modern empiricism, the world view of the witnesses is difficult for us to grasp," and thus it is less impressive that "three signatories to the Book of Mormon saw and heard an angel."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 194-95.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the witnesses were family, close friends, or financial backers of Joseph Smith. Cowdery, Page, and the five Whitmers were related by marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] later joked, "I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Fawn Brodie, ''No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), second ed., 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although Harris continued to testify to the truth of the [[Book of Mormon]] even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he "seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience."&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Early Mormon Documents'', 2: 255. The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris "used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and 'seeing with the spiritual eye,' and the like." [[Pomeroy Tucker]], ''Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism'' (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1867), 71 in ''EMD'', 3: 122. John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the book, said that he had asked Harris, "Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?" According to Gilbert, Harris "looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye." John H. Gilbert, "Memorandum," 8 September 1892, in ''EMD'', 2: 548. Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with "the eye of faith" or "spiritual eyes." Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 &amp; 1828 in ''EMD'', 2: 270; Jesse Townsend to Phineas Stiles, 24 December 1833, in ''EMD'', 3: 22. In 1838, Harris is said to have told an Ohio congregation that "he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination." Stephen Burnett to Lyman E. Johnson, 15 April 1838 in ''EMD'', 2: 291. A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio, said that Harris "never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision." Reuben P. Harmon statement, c. 1885, in ''EMD'', 2: 385.&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Smith's death, [[James Strang]], claiming to be Smith's chosen successor, also produced [[Voree plates|buried plates]] and the testimony of eleven witnesses to their authenticity. All living witnesses to the Book of Mormon (except possibly Cowdery)—three of the Whitmers, Martin Harris, and Hiram Page—accepted at least briefly Strang's "leadership, angelic call, metal plates, and his translation of these plates as authentic."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 212-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apologetics===
* LDS church leaders and student manuals note that none of the witnesses ever denied his testimony as it was printed in the Book of Mormon nor denied that Smith was a true prophet at the time he translated the book.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Dallin H. Oaks]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1999/05/the-witness-martin-harris "The Witness: Martin Harris"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign'']], May 1999; [[James E. Faust]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/11/a-growing-testimony "A Growing Testimony"], ''Ensign'', November 2011; [[Henry B. Eyring]], [http://www.lds.org/liahona/2003/11/an-enduring-testimony-of-the-mission-of-the-prophet-joseph "An Enduring Testimony of the Witness of the Prophet Joseph"], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', November 2003;[http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-4-remember-the-new-covenant-even-the-book-of-mormon "Lesson 4: Remember the New Covenant, Even the Book of Mormon"], ''Doctrine and Covenants and Church History: Gospel Doctrine Teacher's Manual (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apologists note that after being excommunicated, Harris and Cowdery later returned to the church.&lt;ref&gt;A list of articles is available in the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research|FAIR]] Topical Guide, under [http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai109.html ''Book of Mormon Witnesses''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072851/http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai109.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}.

The term '''Cairo 52''' refers to the fifty-two men who were arrested on May 11, 2001, aboard a floating [[gay nightclub]] called the '''Queen Boat''', which was moored on the [[Nile]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="dalacoura1295"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalacoura|first1=Katerina|title=Homosexuality as cultural battleground in the Middle East: culture and postcolonial international theory|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=2014|volume=35|issue=7|pages=1295–1296|doi=10.1080/01436597.2014.926119}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ashraf.jpg|thumb|280px|Ashraf Zanati, one of the Cairo 52, who later fled to [[Vancouver, BC]], [[Canada]].]] --&gt;

==Charges==
Of fifty-two men arrested, fifty were charged with "habitual debauchery" and "obscene behaviour" under Article 9c of Law No. 10 of 1961 on the Combat of [[Prostitution]].  Another two were charged with "contempt of religion" under Article 98f of the Penal Code. All fifty-two men pleaded [[innocent]]. 
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Cairo 52.jpg|thumb|280px|left|The Cairo 52 in detention.]] --&gt;

==Treatment of Arrest==
According to the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]] (IGLHRC), the men were subjected to beatings and [[forensic]] examinations to "prove their homosexuality".  All 52 men were kept for twenty-two hours a day in two cramped cells with no beds.

==Trials==
[[Image:QueenBoat.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Queen Boat]]
The trials of the "Cairo 52" lasted five months and the defendants were vilified in the Egyptian [[News media|media]], which printed their real names and addresses, and branded them as agents against the State. The trials were condemned by international [[human rights]] organizations, members of [[US Congress]] and the [[United Nations]]. Lawyers for the defense argued that the cases should be dismissed on the grounds of [[false arrest]], improper arrest procedures, falsified evidence and police intimidation. During the trial, homosexuality was characterized as "un-Egyptian".&lt;ref name="dalacoura1295"/&gt;

On November 14, 2001, twenty-one of the men were convicted of the "habitual practice of debauchery," one man of "contempt for religion," and another, accused of being the "ringleader," was convicted of both charges and received the heaviest sentence, five years' [[penal labour|hard labour]].  A fifty-third man, a teenager, was tried in juvenile court and was sentenced to the maximum penalty of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of probation.

In May 2002, those convicted were released pending a second trial; both the guilty and not-guilty verdicts were overturned, provoking international outrage.  In July 2002, fifty of the men began a second trial (the other two men had been convicted of contempt for religion, and their sentences were upheld).  This trial, held at Qasr-al-Nil Misdemeanors Court in Cairo and presided over by Judge Abdel Karim, the same judge who had presided over the first trial, lasted only fifteen minutes, ending when Karim [[recusal|recused]] himself.  The trial was then moved to September.  The retrial ended in March, 2003.  Twenty-one men were handed three-year jail sentences and twenty-nine were acquitted.

==Cairo 52 in the media==
The Cairo 52 were featured in a documentary by After Stonewall Productions, narrated by [[Janeane Garofalo]], entitled ''[[Dangerous Living: Coming Out in the Developing World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080214183007/http://www.afterstonewall.com/press.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of [[Maher Sabry]]'s unapologetic film ''[[All My Life (2008 film)|Toul Omry]]'' (''All My Life'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334617/#]&lt;/ref&gt;  details the lives of gay men in Egypt against the backdrop of the Cairo 52 and the notorious Queen Boat arrests. One of the characters in the film "Kareem" is almost arrested in the police raid on the floating discothèque. The news of the arrests and the follow-up in the media and newspapers is discussed by the characters throughout the film. One of the Cairo 52 men is featured in [[Parvez Sharma]]'s documentary ''[[A Jihad for Love]]'' (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11972">A '''character arc''' is the transformation or inner journey&lt;ref name="Gerke"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[character (arts)|character]] over the course of a story. If a story has a character arc, the character begins as one sort of person and gradually transforms into a different sort of person in response to changing developments in the story. Since the change is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait (for example, from greed to benevolence), the geometric term ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' is often used to describe the sweeping change. In most stories, [[main character|lead characters]] and [[protagonist]]s are the characters most likely to experience character arcs,&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible for lesser characters to change as well.&lt;ref name="Gerke" /&gt; A driving element of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of many stories is that the main character seems initially unable to overcome opposing forces, possibly because they lack skills or knowledge or resources or friends. To overcome such obstacles, the protagonist must change, possibly by learning new skills, to arrive at a higher sense of self-awareness or capability. Protagonists can achieve such self-awareness by interacting with their environment, by enlisting the help of mentors, by changing their viewpoint, or by some other method.

==Dramatic narrative structure==
{{main|Dramatic structure}}
Throughout the trajectory of narratives with a tripartite structure, character arcs often unfold beside the narrative arc in the following way:

===First act===
During the first act, the character arc is established or re-established for at least one character, the main character (the protagonist), within the exposition (noument) of the environment including relationships to other characters. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident, known as the [[Inciting Incident|inciting incident]], or catalyst occurs that confronts the protagonist, whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first [[Climax (narrative)|turning point]].  After the first turning point, life will never be the same for the protagonist and raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the story. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, for example, Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?&lt;ref name=bible&gt;{{harvtxt|Trottier|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second act===
During the second act, also referred to as "[[rising action]]", the character arc develops as the protagonist attempts to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to discover ever-worsening situations, which often lead to the learning of new skills, the discovery of capabilities, and (sometimes late in the second act if at all) the raising of self-awareness.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

===Third act===
During the third act, including the climax, "[[falling action]]" and resolution (denouement), the narrative arc is completed although the character arc typically is not.  During the climax, because the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question is answered, a character arc reaches a place where the character gains a new sense of who they are becoming.  As the plot and its subplots resolve, the character arc's emphasis shifts from the learning of any new skills or the discovery of dormant capabilities to the awakening of a higher level of self-awareness, which in turn changes who the character is becoming.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== In literature ===
Some examples include:

* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' sees the eponymous character, once a young scholarly prince full of promise, quickly becoming a melancholic brooder after his father's death. The play shows his slow but deadly fall into madness.
* In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist [[Raskolnikov]] commits a murder, that leads him on a path of redemption, and after an intense inner struggle, he realizes that he needs to be punished for his actions, reporting himself to the authorities.
* [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'' includes a myriad of characters that transform against the backdrop of social events. [[Jean Valjean]] starts as a selfish, violent convict and develops into a generous and loving father to [[Cosette]], who in turn transforms from an abused, lonely and somewhat secluded child to a beautiful and caring woman.
* [[Ursula Le Guin]]'s protagonist from her ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' quartet gradually changes from an impulsive and arrogant youth to a stoic and wise man, reconciling the darkness within and all the bad actions it had caused.
* ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of books by [[George R.R. Martin]] shows numerous examples of complete character arcs. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] transforms from a naive young girl to a queen and a conqueror, only to fall from grace after a misuse of power. The character of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], undergoes a similar arc of embracing the need to govern and rule and metaphorically "kills the boy and lets the man be born" only to die after a misuse of power. Other characters such as [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Jaime Lannister]], start out as childish and petty, but once faced with the cruelty of the world, Jaime grows into a mature and wise leader, and Sansa grows into a strong-willed and poised lady.

=== In film ===
Some examples include:

* In ''[[Tootsie]]'', [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character begins as a [[misogynist]]ic [[chauvinist]] but when he is forced to play the part of a woman, he also experiences a change in how he views women and becomes a different character by the end.
* In ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', Jim begins as a carefree young boy.  After the Japanese take over [[Shanghai]] and he is separated from his family, he is forced to suffer trauma because of the war.
* In ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), widely regarded as one of the [[greatest films ever made]], Michael Corleone initially wants nothing to do with the crime business of his father, Don Vito Corleone. When Vito is critically injured in a shooting, however, Michael gradually becomes more involved in a war of retribution on those responsible. This, effectively and ironically, sets him down the path to becoming Don of the Corleone crime syndicate. Its acclaimed sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), chronicles Michael's effective fall from grace as a result of becoming a powerful crime lord.
* In ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), Travis Bickle degenerates from a somewhat disturbed, highly disorganized Vietnam war veteran into an obsessive psychotic.
* In ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), [[Henry Hill]] (played by [[Ray Liotta]]) goes from being a suave and sophisticated gangster to a paranoid nervous wreck due to a severe [[cocaine]] addiction.
* In ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]] begins the movie embracing her ice powers. After injuring her sister  [[Anna (Disney)|Anna]] she becomes scared of her powers and considers herself a monster. After her sister sacrifices herself, Elsa finally embraces her powers again. Anna begins the movie as a social butterfly willing to throw herself into any man's arms. After [[Hans (Disney)|Hans]] betrays her, Anna learns that looks can sometimes be deceiving.
*In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] begins a story arc dealing with accepting himself as one person rather than seeing Bruce Banner separate. It continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and will conclude in ''[[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers 4]]''.

=== In television ===
Like a [[story arc]], which often is composed of many [[dramatic structure|narrative arcs]], the character arc is not confined within the limits of one narrative.  The character arc may extend over to the next story, a [[sequel]], or another episode.  In episodic [[TV series]], the character arc functions as a [[narrative hook]] that writers often use to ensure viewers continue watching.

* The TV series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' made heavy use of character arcs throughout its run, with story arcs (or mysteries, as the show was famed for) normally being used to move the plot along in the background, as the four protagonists, [[Susan Mayer]], [[Lynette Scavo]], [[Bree Van de Kamp]], and [[Gabrielle Solis]], dealt with their various foibles and flaws, through the eyes of their dead friend and neighbour, [[Mary Alice Young]].
* Over the course of the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|1995|9}}), [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]] starts from a young, idealistic Greek farm girl to becoming a warrior, and in the end, she becomes [[Xena]]'s successor.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' focuses on character arcs for each of the survivors of a plane crash. [[Jack Shephard]] accepting his role as protector of the island, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] going from a self-centered con-man to a mature leader, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]'' discovering his destiny on the island.

* ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|2001|10}}) focuses on character arcs for each of its main characters as they progress into their ''[[Superman]]'' comic book identities. [[Clark Kent]]'s arc revolved around the gradual acceptance of his destiny and becoming a hero. The series also tracks [[Lex Luthor]]'s progression into darkness and [[Lois Lane]]'s emulation of her cousin [[Chloe Sullivan|Chloe]] as she becomes a hardened journalist. Other characters have their eventual character arc alluded to but never explicitly defined or realized onscreen, such as [[Perry White]]'s rise to editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and [[Lex Luthor]]'s ascension to [[President of the United States]]. As well as individual characters, there are arcs involving many characters which intertwine to tell about the formation of the [[Justice League]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*In ''[[Breaking Bad]],'' [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] begins as a high school chemistry teacher struggling with a serious illness while trying to support his family financially. His decision to become a manufacturer of addictive illegal drugs starts a downward spiral in which his wife, [[Skyler White]], divorces him, and his character ''arcs'' from a morally responsible regular guy into a dangerous monster.
* The teen drama series ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'' features two character arcs for its protagonist Clay Jensen: In the flashbacks, Clay begins as a shy young man until meeting [[Hannah Baker]]. In the present, after Hannah's death, he becomes emotionally withdrawn until listening to the tapes left behind by his former friend. After learning the truth, he becomes a warrior and a voice of justice for Hannah.

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''

*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''

*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult.

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

The word '''character sketch''' means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.

The first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style.   As Pat Rogers notes, [[Henry Fielding]], in book I, chapter 14 of ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'', invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: "Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture." Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.

In later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical.  Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of "Big John" or "the country rube" or "the wise Squire").  Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.

Today, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.

The '''coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges riksvapen}}) has a lesser and a greater version.

== Regulated usage ==
The usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, [[Swedish Code of Statutes|Act]] [http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19700498.HTM 1970:498], which states (in unofficial translation) that "in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered."

Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.

==Variants==
The arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/rikskal/1909/0002.html|title=i (Svensk rikskalender / 1909)|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also formally codifies the differences between the "greater" and "lesser" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.

===Greater version===
The greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A shield [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], quartered by a cross [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] with outbent arms, and an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three [[Crown (heraldry)|open crowns]] Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams [[argent]], a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] crowned with an open crown Or armed [[gules]]. The inescutcheon is [[Division of the field|party per pale]] the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a ''vasa'' Or); and the [[House of Bernadotte]] (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. [[Supporters|Supported]] by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] Or. All surrounded by [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.''&lt;ref&gt;Original text of Swedish statute 1982:268, 2 §, states: ''Stora riksvapnet utgörs av en blå huvudsköld, kvadrerad genom ett kors av guld med utböjda armar, samt en hjärtsköld som innehåller det kungliga husets dynastivapen. Huvudsköldens första och fjärde fält innehåller tre öppna kronor av guld, ordnade två över en. Huvudsköldens andra och tredje fält innehåller tre ginbalksvis gående strömmar av silver, överlagda med ett upprest, med öppen krona krönt lejon av guld med röd tunga samt röda tänder och klor. Hjärtskölden är kluven. Första fältet innehåller Vasaättens vapen: ett i blått, silver och rött styckat fält, belagt med en vase av guld. Andra fältet innehåller ätten Bernadottes vapen: i blått fält en ur vatten uppskjutande bro med tre valv och två krenelerade torn, allt av silver, däröver en örn av guld med vänstervänt huvud och sänkta vingar gripande om en åskvigg av guld samt överst Karlavagnens stjärnbild av guld. Huvudskölden är krönt med en kunglig krona och omges av Serafimer ordens insignier. Sköldhållare är två tillbakaseende, med kunglig krona krönta lejon med kluvna svansar samt röda tungor, tänder och klor. Lejonen står på ett postament av guld. Det hela omges av en med kunglig krona krönt hermelinsfodrad vapenmantel av purpur med frans av guld och uppknuten med tofsprydda snören av guld. Stora riksvapnet får brukas även utan ordensinsignier, sköldhållare, postament eller vapenmantel.''

The greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson]] in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berghman |first=Arvid |title=Dynastien Bernadottes vapen och det svenska riksvapnet |series=Skrifter / utgivna av Riksheraldikerämbetet, 99-2298099-1 ; 1 |year=1944 |publisher=Svensk litteratur |location=Stockholm |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by [[Esaias Tegnér]]:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;As long as [[Charles's Wain]] still turns,
Its golden wheels around the Northern zone,
As long as the land still produces iron and heroes,
Intact shall stand the ancient Swedish throne.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. [[Ursa Major]], or as it is called in Swedish, ''Karlavagnen'' (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/early_history_of_heraldry/the_three_crowns_of_sweden.htm|title=The Heraldry Society|website=Theheraldrysociety.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Personal command-sign of the King of Sweden.svg|thumb|left|The personal command sign, for military use, of the King is a rendition of the emblazonment of the greater arms. Introduced by royal regulation in 1943, it has only been created once.]]

The arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (''queue fourchée''), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the [[Order of Seraphim]], the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 2 and 3, Lag No. 268 om Sveriges Riksvapen of April 29, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the [[House of Bernadotte|Royal House]], with the alterations and additions decided by him.

[[Blazon]]: "The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an [[inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.

In the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] and the [[House of Bernadotte]]. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or."

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the [[Government of Sweden]] and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all [[Swedish police]] uniforms and in various coats of arms of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Blazon: "Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one." Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]."

A '''deed of change of name''' is a legal document—used in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some other countries with [[legal system]]s based on English [[common law]]—for an official [[name change]] by a person or family. It is one use of a [[deed poll]].

Some organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without documentation, such as a deed or [[statutory declaration]]. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview&lt;/ref&gt; according to common law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/604/note/made&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal procedure==
===United Kingdom===
In [[England and Wales]], such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]]. Deeds so registered are advertised in the ''[[London Gazette]]''. A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Senior Master]] on behalf of the [[Master of the Rolls]] who will take into account the child's [[best interests]]. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change a child’s name|url=https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/change-a-childs-name|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=31 January 2015|quote=To change the name of a child aged under 16 (sometimes called a ‘minor’) you’ll need either: the agreement of everyone with parental responsibility [or] a court order}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the child does not object to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration of deeds is regulated by the ''Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994'', [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] 1994/604&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/cy/uksi/1994/604/made/data.htm?wrap=true |title=Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 |publisher=HM Government|website=legislation.data.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as amended&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/enrolling/enrolment-regulations/1994 Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 SI 1994/604 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;)
. Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.

Registration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a [[witness]], carries sufficient legal [[authority]] to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.

The procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in [[Northern Ireland]] are similar to those in England and Wales.
In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/614120/Guidance_Booklet_March_2017__ILB_44_03.17_.pdf |title=Applying for a Passport |publisher=HM Passport Office |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office.  However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614150953/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |title=Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a deed poll of change of name ({{lang-ga|Athrú Ainm de réir Gníomhais Aonpháirtí}}) is obtainable from the Central Office of the [[Four Courts]], Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician [[Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus|Seán Loftus]], who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.

==History==
In ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'' [1946] Ch 183,&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Re-Parrott-Cox-v-Parrott-1946-Ch-183 ''Re'' Parrott, Cox ''v'' Parrott &lt;nowiki&gt;[1946]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ch 183]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Vaisey|Mr Justice Vaisey]] stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's [[Christian name]] (first name) &amp;ndash; that could be done by only an [[Act of Parliament]]. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed "Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'', the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed".

The '''Eight Great Eminent Officials''' ({{zh|c=八大元老|p=Bā dà yuánlǎo}}), abbreviated as the '''Eight Elders''' ({{zh|c=八老|p=Bā lǎo}}), were a group of elderly members of the [[Communist Party of China]] who held substantial power during the 1980s and 1990s. In the English-speaking world, these men are often called '''The Eight Immortals''' as an [[allusion]] to the Taoist deities commonly known as the [[Eight Immortals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=William A.|title=Politics in China: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-533530-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk80evDTZIYC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in "strongman politics" ==
The politburo system was created by the Bolsheviks in 1917, when [[Vladimir Lenin]] established it to command and control the [[October Revolution]]. It was later adopted by the Chinese communists.  In both the early Chinese and Russian politburos, "strongman politics" played a large role in internal decision-making. Politburos under both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] were later criticized for being dysfunctional and largely decorative, allowing the top leaders to dictate both party policy and the fate of the other leaders.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Under [[Deng Xiaoping]], important decisions were often made in Deng's home with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called "Eight Elders". Deng ruled as paramount leader, although he never held the top title of the party or the state. However, Deng was able to remove three Party leaders with the aid of the Eight Elders. [[Hua Guofeng]] was gradually removed from Premier and Party Chairman between 1980 and 1981; [[Hu Yaobang]] was removed in 1987; and, [[Zhao Ziyang]] was removed in 1989.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang&gt;Xiang, Lanxin (Apr 20, 2012). "Bo Xilai probe shows up China's outdated system of government". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descendants ==
Descendants of the Eight Elders who have benefited significantly from nepotism and cronyism constitute a group now known as "the [[Princelings]]" or the "Crown Prince Party". Its members, rising through party ranks, can easily overrule any opposition in their jurisdictions, even if they are assigned to a local administrative position. They are often seen to outrank other party officials and possess greater prestige due to their lineage.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang/&gt; Bloomberg has reported on the extensive wealth accumulated by these descendants via their roles in various public and private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heirs of Mao’s Comrades Rise as New Capitalist Nobility|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-26/immortals-beget-china-capitalism-from-citic-to-godfather-of-golf.html|accessdate=December 28, 2012 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==

"[[Jinling]]" was a former name of the city of [[Nanjing]]. In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the terms 金陵八家 and 南京八家 are both used, though the former ("Eight Masters of Jinling") is more frequently used than the latter ("Eight Masters of Nanjing"). In [[English language|English]], on the other hand, the term "Eight Masters of Nanjing" is more frequently used than the term "Eight Masters of Jinling".

[[File:IJVSanFranciscoChurch1.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A monument dedicated to "Ang Quince Martires ng Bicol]]
The '''Fifteen Martyrs of Bicol''' ({{lang-es|Quince Martires del Bicolandia}}) were [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[Patriotism|patriots]] in [[Bicol Region|Bicol]], [[Philippines]] who were executed by [[firing squad]] on January 4, 1897, for cooperating with the [[Katipunan]] during the [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://naga.gov.ph/naga-smiles-2/bikol-honors-its-15-martyrs-of-the-1896-revolution&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Martyrs==
11 of the 15 were executed at the [[Luneta]] in [[Manila]].

* '''Rev. Inocencio Herrera''' - a native of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Rizal]], he grew up in the [[Bicol Region]] and enrolled in the seminary of Nueva Caceres (now [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]]). He was a brilliant young man and had always topped his class. Gifted with a good voice, he became the choir master of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Nueva Caceres. He was only 30 years old when the Spaniards executed him.
* '''Rev. Gabriel Prieto''' - He demonstrated unusual wit and intelligence. He was a consistent scholar at the seminary of Nueva Caceres, where he studied for the priesthood. After his ordination, he was appointed by Msgr. Herrera as his adviser and confidential secretary. Father Prieto was denounced by the Spanish friars for his liberal and independent ideas.
* '''Rev. Severino Diaz''' - He was born in [[Bulan, Sorsogon]] of poor but hardworking parents. He was a model student at the seminary and later as parish priest of Nueva Caceres. He attended to his flock with extraordinary zeal. People remember him as the man who rebuilt and improved the [[Naga Cathedral]]. The Spanish friars were jealous of him for becoming the first Filipino Cura Paroco of Nueva Caceres. He was 45 years old when he was executed at the Luneta.
* '''Manuel Abella''' - A native of Catanauan, Quezon, he was better known for his philanthropic activities among the poor and underprivileged. He was 60 years old when he faced the firing squad in Bagumbayan.
* '''Domingo Abella''' - A son of Manuel Abella. Frank and outspoken, he took every opportunity to denounce the abuses and arrogance of the [[Spaniards]]. He was only 25 when he was executed at the Luneta.
* '''[[Camilo Jacob]]''' - A commercial photographer and native of [[Polangui, Albay]]. Like Domingo Abella, he was open-hearted. Suspected of conniving with the revolutionists, Jacob was tortured and starved to death in prison.
* '''Tomas Prieto''' - A brother of Rev. Gabriel Prieto. A pharmacist, he was popular with the common people for his liberal and progressive ideas. He was executed at the age of 30.
* '''Florendo Lerma''' - A theater owner and playwright from [[Quiapo, Manila]], he went to [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] at the age of 15 and established the first movie house in Naga.
* '''Macario Valentin''' - He was chief of the night patrol in Naga. He took advantage of his position by siding with the revolutionists, whom he supplied with valuable information about the activities of the Spanish militia.
* '''Mariano Melgarejo''' - A native son of Naga. In his diary, he wrote: "I look forward to the day when Filipinas takes her place among the free nations of the world."
* '''Cornelio Mercado''' - An employee in the public works department of Nueva Caceres.

The four Bicolano freedom fighters who were either exiled or died in prison were:

* '''Leon Hernandez''' - A resident of [[Libmanan, Camarines Sur]], who was well-to-do and highly influential. He was thrown into the municipal jail in Nueva Caceres, where he was tortured to death for denying participation in the revolutionary movement.
* '''Ramon Abella''' - Also a son of Manuel Abella, who was executed at the Luneta. He was a strong advocate of the progressive and independent aspiration of his father.
* '''Mariano Arana''' - A government surveyor who died in exile on [[Bioko]] Island (then Fernando Po).
* '''Mariano Ordenanza''' - A clerk in the Bureau of Public Works. He died in jail in Manila shortly after he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Spanish Council of War.

==Legacy==
While the heroic deeds and martyrdom of secular priests [[Mariano Gomez]], [[Jose Burgos]] and [[Jacinto Zamora]] are known all over the land and familiar to history students, the memory of the 15 martyrs of Bicolandia is confined to [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], the heart of Bicol. For more than 70 years, the people of Naga City and nearby municipalities have been paying tribute to these martyrs every fourth day of January.  During the incumbency of the late Camarines Sur Gov. Julian Ocampo, a monument was erected in Naga City in memory of the ''Quince Martires del
Bicolandia''.'' The monument, located in the heart of the city, was formally dedicated on November 30, 1923. 

Official recognition of the 15 martyrs of Bicolandia came only on February 20, 1950 when the director of the Department of Education added to the list of significant dates in Philippine history January 4, 1897, the day when Filipino freedom fighters from the Bicol region were executed.

== Outline of story ==
[[File:25 tam back.jpg|thumb| Backside of Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|25 tam banknote]], dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented.]]
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a [[hornbill]]) on top of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruschke|first1=Andreas|title=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: The Qinghai part of Amdo|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Press|location=Bangkok|isbn=9747534592|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuKfAAAAMAAJ|series=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: Amdo|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1040.htm|title=The Jataka|volume=I|first=Robert|last=Chalmers|author-link=Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers|year=1895|chapter=Tittira Jātaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple [[Śāriputra]].&lt;ref name="Whitecross 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Whitecross,|title="Virtuous Beings": The Concept of ''tha damtshig'' and Being a Moral Person in Contemporary Bhutanese Society|journal=Himalaya, the Journal of the Association for Nepal and Himalayan Studies|date=1 January 2010|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/himalaya/vol28/iss1/6/|language=en|issn=2471-3716|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malalasekera 1938"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tittira Jātaka (No.37)|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|author-link=G P Malalasekera|first=G.P.|last=Malalasekera|volume=2|url=http://palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tittira_j_37_117_319_438.htm|year=1938|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the [[five precepts]] and teaching them to others.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005" /&gt; One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the [[Pali]] version, called the ''Tittira Jataka''.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a [[pecking-order]] according to strength, size and power: it is {{em|the partridge}} which is most respected, not the elephant.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penjore|first1=Ugyen|title=Understanding the symbolism of Thuenpa Puen Zhi|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,1531,0,0,1,0#.WI0s0FUrK70|via=The Buddhist Channel|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Kuensel Online|date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, "the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC|date=1992|publisher=[[Curzon Press]]|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=978-0-7007-0230-5|page=224|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the {{em|number of years ordained}} as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] (''{{lang-sa|bhikṣu}}''; ''{{lang-pi|bhikkhu}}'') is measured, rather than {{em|age}}.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|title=The Jatakas: Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta|date=2006|publisher=[[Penguin UK]]|isbn=9788184750348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: "A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code|date=2013|publisher=[[Metta Forest Monastery]]|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|volume=II|location=California|page=92|pages=|quote=|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|via=|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four animals represent the different [[habitats]] of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding  of language.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez 2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=The Parrot’s Voice and the Partridge’s Feathers: The Languaging of Animals and Animal Language in Early Indian Texts|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/28521|first=Andrea Lorene|last=Gutiérrez|publisher=[[The University of Texas]]|type=M.A. Thesis|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|53}} The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/pdf/Signs/Bhutan/BH_PRG_03.pdf|title=The Four Harmonious Friends|last=|first=|date=12 June 2008|website=[[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinayavastu]]'' ({{bo|w='dul ba'i gzhi}}), which forms the first section of the [[Kangyur]], the canon of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Dagyab 2016" /&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="sagaster" /&gt; In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, and in the texts of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] orders, almost the same ''Jātaka'' tale is found in the ''Vinaya'' and ''Jātaka'' collections. The [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Mahīśāsaka]] orders did not consider the story part of the ''Jātaka'', however, and only included it in their ''Vinayas''. [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a [[didactic]] [[parable]] taught by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Canonical Jātaka Tales in Comparative Perspective: The Evolution of Tales of the Buddha's Past Lives|journal=Fuyan Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=7|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38470683/CanonicalJatakas.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485644573&amp;Signature=et7fWx%2FMyFxtAwEa%2BgTKug1ISow%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCanonical_Jataka_Tales_in_Comparative_Pe.pdf|publisher=Fuyan Buddhist Institute|location=[[Hsinchu]]|issn=2070-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Irish]] scholar [[Eleanor Hull]] has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the ''Jātaka'' do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hull|first1=Eleanor|author-link=Eleanor Hull|title=The Hawk of Achill or the Legend of the Oldest Animals|journal=Folklore|date=December 1932|volume=43|issue=4|pages=377, 383|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=W.R.S.|title=The Bible of Tibet: Tibetan Tales from Indian Sources|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-136-20297-1|page=302|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoiZAeFA_8YC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Mike|title=Our heritage is already broken: meditations on a regenerative conservation for cultural and natural heritage|journal=Human Ecology Review|date=2016|page=13|doi=10.4225/13/581fcdf8dc329|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/100985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Francisco de Jesus Marto''' (11 June 1908 – 4 April 1919), his sister '''Saint Jacinta de Jesus Marto''' (5 March 1910 – 20 February 1920)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fatima.pt/en/news/today-marks-the-anniversary-of-saint-jacinta-martos-birth Article on Official Webpage: Shrime of Fatima, "Today marks the anniversary of Saint Jacinta Marto's birth."]&lt;/ref&gt; and their cousin [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] (1907&amp;ndash;2005) were children from Aljustrel, a small hamlet near [[Fátima, Portugal]], who witnessed three apparitions of the [[Guardian Angel of Portugal|Angel of Peace]] in 1916 and several [[Marian apparition|apparitions]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] at [[Cova da Iria]] in 1917. The title [[Our Lady of Fátima]] was given to the Virgin Mary as a result, and the [[Sanctuary of Fátima]] became a major centre of world [[Christian pilgrimage]]. The two were solemnly [[Canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Francis]] at the [[Sanctuary of Fátima|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima]], in [[Portugal]] on 13 May 2017, the first centennial of the first Apparition of [[Our Lady of Fátima]].

== Life ==
[[File:Francisco Marto2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Francisco Marto]]
The youngest children of Manuel and Olimpia Marto, Francisco and Jacinta were typical of Portuguese village children of that time. They were illiterate&lt;ref name="Religious Phenomena"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=J. Gordon |last=Melton |year=2008 |title=Fatima (Portugal) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOldV3dVOoUC&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Jacinta%20and%20Francisco%20Marto%20illiterate&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacinta%20and%20Francisco%20Marto%20illiterate&amp;f=false |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena |pages=107–109 |location=[[Canton, Maine]] |publisher=[[Visible Ink Press]] |isbn=1-57859-209-7 |accessdate=15 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a rich [[oral tradition]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

According to the memoirs of their cousin [[Sister Lúcia]], Francisco had a placid disposition, was somewhat musically inclined, and liked to be by himself to think. Jacinta was affectionate with a sweet singing voice and a gift for dancing. Following their experiences, their fundamental personalities remained the same. Francisco preferred to pray alone, saying that this would "console Jesus for the sins of the world". Jacinta said she was deeply affected by a terrifying vision of Hell shown to the children at the third apparition, and deeply convinced of the need to save sinners through penance and sacrifice as the Virgin had told the children to do. All three children, but particularly Francisco and Jacinta, practised stringent [[Mortification of the flesh|self-mortification]]s to this end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastorinhos.com/_wp/wp-content/uploads/MemoriasI_en.pdf Sister Lúcia: ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words'', ''Memoir 2'', p. 94], online, accessed 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in the report that confirmed Jacinta as [[Beatification|beatified]], observed that she seemed to have "an insatiable hunger for immolation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/saints/jacinta.htm Congregation for the Causes of Saints Decree regarding the Canonization of the Servant of God Jacinta Marto]. 13 May 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apparitions ==
The brother and sister, who tended to their families’ sheep with their cousin Lúcia in the fields of Fátima, Portugal, are said to have witnessed several apparitions of an angel in 1916. Lúcia later recorded the words of several prayers she said they learned from this angel.&lt;ref name="Religious Phenomena"/&gt;

Sister Lúcia wrote in her memoirs that she and her cousins saw the first apparition of Mary on 13 May 1917. At the time of the apparition, Francisco was 8 years old, and Jacinta was 7.&lt;ref name=nd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faith.nd.edu/s/1210/faith/interior.aspx?sitebuilder=1&amp;pgid=13446&amp;cid=28049&amp;ecid=28049&amp;crid=0&amp;calpgid=10817&amp;calcid=24284|title=Blessed Francisco and Jacinta Marto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first apparition, Mary is said to have asked the three children to say the Rosary and to make sacrifices, offering them for the conversion of sinners.&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; She also asked them to return to that spot on the thirteenth of each month for the next six months.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/features/saints/saint.aspx?id=1297 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. "Blesseds Jacinta and Francisco Marto", ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illness and death ==
The siblings were victims of the great [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza]] epidemic that swept through Europe that year. In October 1918, Jacinta told Lucia that Mary had appeared to her and promised to take them to heaven soon.&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; Both lingered for many months, insisting on walking to church to make Eucharistic devotions and prostrating themselves to pray for hours, [[proskynesis|kneeling with their heads on the ground]] as they said the angel had instructed them to do.&lt;ref name=nd/&gt;

[[File:Fatima children with rosaries.jpg|thumb|left|220px|From left to right: Jacinta Marto, [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] and Francisco Marto, holding their [[rosary|rosaries]] in 1917]]
Francisco declined hospital treatment on 3 April 1919, and died at home the next day. Jacinta was moved from one hospital to another in an attempt to save her life, which she insisted was futile. She developed purulent [[pleurisy]] and endured an operation in which two of her ribs were removed. Because of the condition of her heart, she could not be fully anesthetized, and suffered terrible pain, which she said would help to convert many sinners. On 19 February 1920, Jacinta asked the hospital [[chaplain]] who heard her [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to bring her [[Holy Communion]] and administer [[Extreme Unction]] because she was going to die "the next night". He told her that her condition was not that serious and that he would return the next day.  The next day Jacinta was dead; she had died, as she had often said she would, alone.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account of the lives, illnesses and deaths of both children is given in de Marchi, John, ''The True Story of Fatima'', 1950 edition, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/tsfatima.htm entire text on line], found 19 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, shortly before her death at age nine, Jacinta Marto reportedly discussed the [[Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary]] with a then 12-year-old [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you are to say this, don't go and hide. Tell everybody that God grants us graces through the Immaculate Heart of Mary; that people are to ask her for them; and that the Heart of Jesus wants the Immaculate Heart of Mary to be venerated at his side. Tell them also to pray to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for peace, since God entrusted it to her.&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Leo. ''The children of Fatima: Blessed Francisco &amp; Blessed Jacinta Marto'' 2003 OSV Press {{ISBN|1-931709-57-2}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jacinta and Francisco are both buried at the [[Sanctuary of Fátima|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fátima]].&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Leo. 2003, ''The Children of Fatima'', OSV Press {{ISBN|978-1-931709-57-6}} page 271&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beatification and canonization ==

The cause for the siblings' canonization began in 1946.&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt; Exhumed in 1935, Jacinta's face was found [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]];&lt;ref&gt;"On September 12, 1935, the mortal remains of Jacinta, who died in 1920, were exhumed. Her face was found to be incorrupt." Solimeo, Luiz. ''Fatima: A Message More Urgent Than Ever''. (2008) pg. 97. "Today, the remnants of both Francisco and Jacinta rest at the Basilica of Fátima." pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120309072403/http://www.crc-internet.org/images/jacinta.jpg Jacinta's exhumation photo] at Catholic Counter-Reformation, Page found 13 May 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029034002/http://www.crc-internet.org/images/jacinta.jpg |date=29 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco's had decomposed. By 1951, when she was again exhumed for her reburial in the Basilica, Jacinta had begun to decompose also.&lt;ref&gt;Alipio da Silva Vicente, "[http://ecommons.udayton.edu/imri_photos/138/ Exhumation of Jacinta]". Photograph taken May 1, 1951. Source: University of Dayton Marian Library &amp; Research Institute Photo Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 [[Pope Pius XI]] decided that causes for minors should not be accepted as they could not fully understand [[heroic virtue]] or practice it repeatedly, both of which are essential for canonization. For the next four decades, no sainthood processes for children were pursued. In 1979 the bishop of Leiria-Fátima asked all the world's bishops to write to the Pope, petitioning him to make an exception for Francisco, who had died at age 10, and Jacinta, who had died at age 9. More than 300 bishops sent letters to the Pope, writing that “the children were known, admired and attracted people to the way of sanctity. Favors were received through their intercession.” The bishops also said that the children's canonization was a pastoral necessity for the children and teenagers of the day.&lt;ref name=seyer&gt;[http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/fatima_has_high_hopes_for_francisco_and_jacinta/ Seyer, Loretta G., "Fatima Has High Hopes For Francisco and Jacinta", ''National Catholic Register'', May 16, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] convened a general assembly. Cardinals, bishops, theologians and other experts debated whether it was possible for children to display heroic virtue. Eventually, they decided that, like the very few children who have a genius for music or mathematics, "in some supernatural way, some children could be spiritual prodigies." They were declared venerable by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=seyer/&gt;

On 13 May 2000, they were declared "blessed" in a decree from the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. Jacinta is the youngest non-martyred child ever to be beatified.&lt;ref name=cna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=153|title=BLESSED FRANCISCO AND JACINTA MARTO :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Canonização de Francisco e Jacinta Marto (13 de Maio de 2017).png|thumb|left|275px|Canonization of Jacinta and Francisco Marto by [[Pope Francis]], at the [[Sanctuary of Fátima]] on 13 May 2017]]
In her biography of Jacinta Marto, [[Sister Lúcia]] said that Jacinta had told her of having had many personal visions outside of the Marian visitations; one involved a pope who prayed alone in a room while people outside shouted ugly things and threw rocks through the window. At another time, Jacinta said she saw a pope who had gathered a huge number of people together to pray to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

When Pope John Paul II arrived in Fátima for the first time, in 1982, he said that he had come "because, on this exact date last year in [[St. Peter's Square]], in Rome, there was [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|an attempt on the life of your Pope]], which mysteriously coincided with the anniversary of the first vision at Fátima, that of 13 May 1917. The coincidence of these dates was so great that it seemed to be a special invitation for me to come here."&lt;ref name=seyer/&gt;

Sister Lúcia, when questioned about the [[Third Secret of Fatima|Third Secret]], said that the three of them had been very sad about the suffering of the Pope, and that Jacinta kept saying: ''Coitadinho do Santo Padre, tenho muita pena dos pecadores!'' ("Poor Holy Father, I feel a lot of pity for the sinners!"){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Another miracle was found to have been attributed to their intercession and the process that investigated the presumed miracle was validated on 8 February 2013. On 23 March 2017, it was announced that Pope Francis would canonize them while visiting Portugal on 12 and 13 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/03/23/pope-francis-will-canonize-two-children-who-saw-our-lady-fatima|title=Pope Francis will canonize two of the children who saw Our Lady of Fatima|date=23 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope solemnly canonized the children on 13 May 2017 during the centennial of the first apparition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-Latest-Pope-Francis-prays-at-Fatima-basilica-11143520.php#item-39786|title=The Latest: Pope ends Portugal visit, leaves for Rome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the Catholic Church's youngest saints who did not die as martyrs, with Jacinta the youngest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pope-francis-canonizes-children-behind-three-secrets-fatima-n758531|title=Pope canonizes children behind 'Three Secrets of Fatima'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/world/europe/in-portugal-pope-proclaims-two-fatima-siblings-saints.html|title=In Portugal, Pope Proclaims Two Fátima Siblings Saints|first=Raphael|last=Minder|date=13 May 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2017/pope-recognizes-miracle-attributed-to-fatima-visionaries.cfm|title=Pope recognizes miracle attributed to Fatima visionaries|website=www.catholicnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

'''Gaitelgrima''' is a [[Lombards|Lombard]] feminine name. There are several notable Gaitelgrimas in history.  The identities of these five women (as well as some others of the same name) are often confused because they were all closely related to each other and to two men: [[Guaimar III of Salerno]] and his son, [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]]; they were the princes of Salerno from about 983 to 1027 and from 1027 to 1052.

The first was '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''', daughter of [[Atenulf I of Capua]], married [[Guaimar II of Salerno]] and was the mother of [[Gisulf I of Salerno]]. 

The second, also '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''' or '''Gaitelgrima of Benevento''' (died after 1027), was the daughter of [[Pandulf II of Benevento]] and sister of [[Pandulf IV of Capua]].  She was the second wife of Guaimar III and mother of Guaimar IV (his successor), [[Guy, Duke of Sorrento|Guy]] (later duke of [[Sorrento]]), and [[Pandulf of Capaccio|Pandulf]] (later lord of [[Capaccio]]).  She was also the mother of the third Gaitelgrima.  

This third was '''Gaitelgrima of Salerno''', also known as '''Altrude''', who married successively two brothers, [[Drogo of Hauteville]] and [[Humphrey of Hauteville]], who were [[counts of Apulia]].  Through the latter, she was mother to [[Abelard of Hauteville|Abelard]] and [[Herman of Hauteville|Herman]].  

The fourth, also named after Gaitelgrima of Benevento, was also a '''[[Gaitelgrima, daughter of Guaimar IV|Gaitelgrima of Salerno]]'''.  She was the daughter of Guaimar IV of Salerno (see above) and Gemma.  She was married off by her brother [[Gisulf II of Salerno]] to [[Jordan I of Capua]] as was her sister, [[Sichelgaita]], to [[Robert Guiscard]]. 

The last was '''Gaitelgrima, [[Duke of Apulia|Duchess of Apulia]]''', the second wife of [[William II, Duke of Apulia]].  She was the daughter of [[Jordan II of Capua]]. She deeply loved her husband and cut off her hair to cover his coffin at his funeral.

'''George A. Best''' was an English [[association footballer|football]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. He played professionally for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the early 20th century, either side of spells with his hometown club, [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]].

Best made his debut for Blackpool just over halfway through the [[1925–26 Blackpool F.C. season|1925–26]] season, as deputy for [[Len Crompton]], in a 5–2 defeat at Derby County. He appeared in the two successive games — a 3–0 home victory over Bradford City and a 5–0 reversal at Port Vale — before Crompton returned to the line-up.

The following [[1926–27 Blackpool F.C. season|1926–27]] campaign saw Best make 24 [[Football League|League]] appearances. He played his final game for the club on 18 April, in a 2–2 draw at South Shields.

'''''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik''''' ('''GR''') is the informal name of a comprehensive [[table of integrals]] originally compiled by the Russian mathematicians I. S. Gradshteyn and I. M. Ryzhik. Its full title today is '''''Table of Integrals, Series, and Products'''''.

Since its first publication in 1943, it was considerably expanded and it soon became a "classic" and highly regarded reference for mathematicians, scientists and engineers. After the deaths of the original authors, the work was maintained and further expanded by other editors.

At some stage a German and English dual-language translation became available, followed by Polish, English-only and Japanese versions. After several further editions, the Russian and German-English versions went out of print and have not been updated after [[the fall of the Iron Curtain]], but the English version is still being actively maintained and refined by new editors, and it has recently been retranslated back into Russian as well.

==Overview==
One of the valuable characteristics of ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' compared to similar compilations is that most listed integrals are referenced. The literature list contains 92 main entries and 140 additional entries (in the eighth English edition). The integrals are classified by numbers, which haven't changed from the fourth Russian up to the seventh English edition (the numbering in older editions as well as in the eighth English edition is not fully compatible).
The book does not only contain the integrals, but also lists additional properties and related [[special function]]s.
It also includes tables for [[integral transform]]s.
Another advantage of ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' compared to [[computer algebra system]]s is the fact that all special functions and constants used in the evaluation of the integrals are listed in a registry as well, thereby allowing reverse lookup of integrals based on special functions or constants.

On the downsides, ''Gradshteyn and Ryzhik'' has become known to contain a relatively high number of typographical errors even in newer editions, which has repeatedly led to the publication of extensive [[errata]] lists. Earlier English editions were also criticized for their poor translation of mathematical terms&lt;ref name="RMT_85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_153_5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_209_1"/&gt; and mediocre print quality.&lt;ref name="RMT_85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REV_153_5"/&gt;

In the foreword of the first edition by Ryzhik, the author thanked three mathematicians of the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]] for their suggestions and advice: 
[[Vyacheslav Vassilievich Stepanov]] ({{lang|ru|[[Вячеслав Васильевич Степанов]]}}), {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexei Ivanovich Markushevich|de|3=Alexei Iwanowitsch Markuschewitsch|lt=Alexei Ivanovich Markushevich}} ({{lang|ru|Алексей Иванович Маркушевич}}), and [[Ilya Nikolaevich Bronshtein]] ({{lang|ru|[[Илья Николаевич Бронштейн]]}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The third edition (1951) was worked on by Gradshteyn, who also introduced the chapter numbering system in [[decimal notation]]. Gradshteyn planned considerable expansion for the fourth edition, a work he could not finish due to his own death.&lt;ref name="Wolfram_2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=The History and Future of Special Functions |at=The story behind Gradshteyn-Ryzhik |author-first=Stephen |author-last=Wolfram |author-link=Stephen Wolfram |date=2005-10-08 |publisher=[[Stephen Wolfram, LLC]] |work=Wolfram Technology Conference, [[Festschrift]] for [[Oleg Marichev]], in honor of his 60th birthday |location=Champaign, IL, USA |type=speech, blog post |url=http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/history-future-special-functions/#GRbook |accessdate=2016-04-06 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407015353/http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/history-future-special-functions/#GRbook |archivedate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="Gradshteyn_Bio"/&gt; Therefore, the fourth (1962/1963) and fifth (1971) editions were continued by [[Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus]] (Russian: {{lang|ru|Юрий Венеаминович Геронимус}}, German: {{lang|de|Juri Weneaminowitsch Geronimus}})&lt;ref name="Wolfram_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="Geronimus_Bio"&gt;[[Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus]] ({{lang|ru|Юрий Венеаминович Геронимус}}) (1923–&lt;!-- alive amd living in Israel in 2005 according to http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/history-future-special-functions/#GRbook --&gt;), {{GND|131451812}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin]] (Russian: {{lang|ru|Михаил Ю́льевич Цейтлин}}, German: {{lang|de|Michael Juljewitsch Zeitlin}}).&lt;ref group="nb" name="Tseytlin_Bio"&gt;[[Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin]] ({{lang|ru|Михаил Ю́льевич Цейтлин}}), also as M.

In 1963, it was followed by the second edition, a reprint edition with a four-page inlet listing corrections compiled by [[Eldon Robert Hansen]].

Derived from the 1963 edition, but considerably expanded, the third German-English edition by {{lang|de|Ludwig Boll}}&lt;ref group="nb" name="Boll_Bio"&gt;Ludwig Boll (1906–? or 1951?–1987), {{GND|116236140|1068090308}}?&lt;/ref&gt; was finally published in 1981; it incorporated the material of the fifth Russian edition (1971) as well.

Pending this third German-English edition an English-only edition by Alan Jeffrey&lt;ref group="nb" name="Jeffrey_Bio"&gt;Alan Jeffrey (1929-07-16 to 2010-06-06), {{GND|113118120}}. [http://www.ams.org/notices/201008/rtx100801006p.pdf] [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036811.2012.648369] [http://www.librarything.com/author/jeffreyalan]&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1965. Lacking a clear designation by itself it was variously known as first, third&lt;!-- as it followed the 2nd German-English edition and because this edition number fits in nicely after the publication of the (actually so called) fifth English edition in 1994 --&gt; or fourth English edition, as it was based on the then-current fourth Russian edition. The formulas were photographically reproduced and the text translated. This still held true for the expanded fourth English edition in 1980, which added chapters 10 to 17.&lt;ref name="ZBL_521-193-1"/&gt;

Both of these editions saw multiple [[print run]]s each incorporating newly found corrections. Starting with the third printing&lt;!-- 1967 or 1969? --&gt;, updated table entries were marked by adding a small superscript number to the entry number indicating the corresponding print run ("3" etc.&lt;!-- print run "7" of 4th edition is documented for 1990 --&gt;), a convention carried over into later editions by continuing to increase the superscript number as kind of a [[revision number]] (no longer directly corresponding with actual print runs).

The fifth edition (1994), which contained close to 20&amp;thinsp;000 formulas,&lt;ref name="ZBL_918-65002"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="Formula_Entry"/&gt; was electronically reset&lt;ref name="REV_209_1"/&gt; in preparation for a CD-ROM issue of the fifth edition (1996) and in anticipation of further editions. Since the sixth edition (2000), now corresponding with superscript number "10", Daniel Zwillinger&lt;ref group="nb" name="Zwillinger_Bio"&gt;Daniel Zwillinger (1957–), {{GND|172475694}}.&lt;/ref&gt; started contributing as well.

Between July 5 and July 7, 2017, four young men were reported missing in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  All were subsequently found murdered.  The victims were Dean A. Finocchiaro, age 19; Thomas C. Meo, age 21; Jimi T. Patrick, age 19; and Mark R. Sturgis, age 22.

The murders are suspected to have been carried out by cousins Cosmo DiNardo and Sean Michael Kratz, both age 20 at the times of the murder.&lt;ref name=CNNCousins&gt;{{cite web |last=Levenson|first=Eric |title=Cousins charged in homicides of four Pennsylvania men|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/14/us/missing-pennsylvania-men-charges/index.html |website=[[CNN]] |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four victims were murdered, in three separate incidents, after DiNardo arranged to sell them [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name=NBCDiNardoKratzKill&gt;{{cite web |last=McCrone|first=Brian |title=Cosmo DiNardo, Sean Kratz Charged With Allegedly Killing Young Men at Bucks County Farm|url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Second-Man-Sean-Michael-Kratz-Held-in-Connection-to-Four-Murders-at-Bucks-County-Pennsylvania-Farm-Day-After-Cosmo-DiNardo-Confesses-434503403.html |website=[[NBC]] Philadelphia |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

The disappearances began on July 5, with Patrick being the first of the men to vanish. Two days later, on July 7, Meo, Finocchiaro, and Sturgis were also reported missing. Each of the four men was reported to be murdered the same day he went missing.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bucks.crimewatchpa.com/da/29567/post/two-men-charged-homicide-four-solebury-slayings|title=Two Men Charged With Homicide in Four Solebury Slayings|date=14 July 2017|publisher=Bucks County District Attorney's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He failed to show up for work the next day.&lt;ref name=NYTSearch&gt;{{cite web |last=Haag|first=Matthew |title=Search in Pennsylvania for 4 Missing Men Focuses on a Vast Farm |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/missing-men-bucks-county.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=U.S.&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article |website=New York Times |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=10 July 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick met DiNardo that night to buy four pounds of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch /&gt;

His remains were found in a common grave on a [[Solebury Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Solebury Township]] farm (owned by DiNardo's parents), along with the remains of Mark Sturgis and Thomas Meo on July 12, 2017. Finocchiaro's body was the first to be identified.&lt;ref name=PhillyWho&gt;{{cite web |last=Babay|first=Emily |title=Bucks County missing men: Who they are |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/pennsylvania/bucks-4-missing-men-mark-sturgis-jimi-patrick-dean-finocchiaro-thomas-meo-20170713.html |website=Philly |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finocchiaro and DiNardo had a good relationship, with DiNardo saying that they were like cousins.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt; As with Patrick, Finocchiaro had agreed to buy marijuana from DiNardo. This was the first murder in which Kratz was involved; the two men repeatedly shot Finocchiaro. His body was placed in a metal oil tank that had been converted to a pork roaster.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;
* Mark R. Sturgis (November 20, 1994 {{ndash}} July 7, 2017) went to meet his friend Thomas C. Meo (January 30, 1996 {{ndash}} July 7, 2017) at around 6:00 PM on July 7. Both men worked for Sturgis' father's construction company. The two did not show up for work and calls to their cellphones went directly to voice mail.&lt;ref name=NYTSearch/&gt; DiNardo met with Sturgis and Meo at a church to sell Meo marijuana.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt; Meo and Sturgis were both shot as they exited their truck.  When he ran out of ammunition, DiNardo drove over a still-alive Meo with a [[backhoe]], then placed both bodies in a metal tank that also held Finocchiaro's body. DiNardo attempted unsuccessfully to burn the bodies using gasoline.&lt;ref name="CNNCousins" /&gt; He used the backhoe to bury the tank containing the three bodies.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;

DiNardo, a drug dealer, confessed to killing the four men; he said he did so because he felt cheated or threatened during drug transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://articles.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2017/07/suspect_in_pennsylvania_slayin.amp |title=Suspect in Pennsylvania slaying of 4 men burned bodies in a drum after drug deals, source said|first=Tanda |last=Gmiter|date=14 July 2017|work=MLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only motive disclosed by investigators was that DiNardo said he wanted to set the victims up when they came to the farm to buy marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20170714/NEWS/170719777 |title=Grisly details revealed after 2 men charged in killing of missing men in Bucks|first1=Maryclaire|

Second cousins&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt; Cosmo DiNardo (born January 21, 1997) and Sean Michael Kratz (born February 14, 1997), both age 20, were charged in the murders.

On July 10, DiNardo was arrested for an unrelated weapons charge.&lt;ref name=NYTSearch/&gt; He was not allowed to own a firearm due to his [[schizophrenia]]; nevertheless, at least one of the firearms used by the perpetrators belonged to DiNardo's mother.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCDiNardoKratzCharged&gt;{{cite web |last=McCausland|first=Phil |title=Cosmo Dinardo, Sean Michael Kratz Charged With Killing Four in Pennsylvania |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cosmo-dinardo-second-man-charged-killing-four-pennsylvania-n783086 |website=[[NBC News]] |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite 30 run-ins with local police, DiNardo, the son of a wealthy businessman, had, for unexplained reasons, never been convicted of a crime.&lt;ref name=NYTManAdmits&gt;{{cite web |last=Hurdle| first=Jon |title=Man Admits to Killings of 4 Missing Men in Pennsylvania, Lawyer Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/us/bucks-county-missing-pennsylvania.html |website=[[New York Times]] |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiNardo was later released after his father posted 10% of the $1 million bail.&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

On July 12, DiNardo was arrested and charged for stealing and attempting to sell a car that belonged to Thomas Meo for $500.&lt;ref name=BCCTCosmoConfessed&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Malley|first=James |title=BREAKING: Cosmo DiNardo defense attorney says client confessed to 'participation in murders of four young men'|url=http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/news/crime/breaking-cosmo-dinardo-defense-attorney-says-client-confessed-to-participation/article_1d6dcb02-67d9-11e7-908b-1bc4ab8b99aa.html |website=Bucks County Courier Times |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicion was also raised by the fact that Meo left his [[insulin]] in the car, something his family said was unusual for him to do.&lt;ref name=BCCTCosmoConfessed/&gt; His bail was set at $5 million. The next day, DiNardo confessed to the murder of the four men. In exchange for his confession, prosecutors stated that they would not seek the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

The day after his confession, DiNardo was charged with four counts of criminal homicide, conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, abuse of corpse, and 12 other charges.

On July 14, Sean Michael Kratz was also charged with three counts of criminal homicide, conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, abuse of corpse, and two other charges.&lt;ref name=NBCDiNardoKratzCharged/&gt; Unlike DiNardo, Kratz had a criminal history of [[burglary]], conspiracy, criminal trespassing, theft, receiving stolen property, and criminal mischief.&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani''' is a name shared by two short-lived princes and heirs to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Both were named after their father [[Kamehameha III]]. In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], the name means "the red trail of heaven", signifying the roadway by which the god descends from heaven.

'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani I''' (1839–1839) was the eldest son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was named after his father whose full name was Keaweawe{{okina}}ula Kiwala{{okina}}o Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa Kalani Waiakua Kalanikau Iokikilo Kiwala{{okina}}o i ke kapu Kamehameha.  The royal suffix o-Kalani was added in to signified this Prince of [[Heaven]].

The young Prince Keawe died shortly after his birth. His death left Kamehameha III again childless. His younger brother, Keaweaweʻulaokalani II, would not be born until 1842.

==Later==

|}}
'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani II''' (1842–1842) was the second son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was the namesake of his father and his brother.

Initially given in ''[[hānai]]'' to [[Kalākua Kaheiheimālie]], he was instead adopted or ''hānai'' by his grand aunt, [[Kekāuluohi]] and her husband [[Charles Kanaina|Kana{{okina}}ina]] when the old governess of Maui died not three days after his birth. The King promised that he would be sent to the [[Chiefs' Children's School]] once he was weaned and could walk. He soon developed a fever and died, at the age of only 31 days. Dr. Baldwin of Lahaina was convinced that the child was killed by traditional medicinal treatment.

'''Keibu keioiba''' is a mythological or fictional character based on [[Meitei people|Meetei]] folklore. It is a creature having half tiger and half human features, depicted to be transformed from a learned ancient Manipuri physician. He was experimenting his magical skills and powers, and came up with this idea of turning himself into a powerful man with strength of a tiger. He became this creature with the head, limbs and strength of a tiger but failed to remember how to revert to his normal human form, owing to low memory or thinking capacity of a tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Folks.Folk_Tales.Keibu_Keioiba_By_Nganthoi_Lourembam |title=Keibu Keioiba – Fungawari Singbul |publisher=E-Pao|author=B. Jayantakumar Sharma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tale==
This is a story of a kind, dedicated and skilled ancient Manipuri physician, who used to ride on a horse and visit places to heal the suffering ailments. As his knowledge and skill kept on increasing day by day, he kept on wanting to learn more and more. At a time, he was able to do whatever he wanted. He kept on conducting experiments until he decided to turn himself into a tiger one day, for he wanted the power of a tiger.

He taught his wife how to help him turn into a tiger and how to return to his human form. But, as soon as he became the tiger-like creature/ keibu keioiba, he developed the tiger-instinct of roaring and frightening people. So, his wife ran away from him before he could be subjected to return to his human form. Instead, he even tried to kill his wife and ran away in the wild far from home.
When he got hungry, he would come to human villages to steal poultry or fish or livestock, as he never learned how to hunt like a real tiger in the wild. He became the feared and the hated. He began to target humans for food.

He came to a village and took a young girl called Thabaton, who was home alone, left by her seven brothers for work. He was avenged by the brothers and the girl was saved.

==The Morale==
The story depicts the never-ending desire of man for getting more which ultimately ruins himself. It teaches a lesson to us about the evil effects of this human nature. We can witness many examples of this today- e.g., global warming because of the never-ending industrial race, world devastation by never ending arms race in world wars, etc.

==Impacts in Manipur or Meetei society==
Almost every Manipuri grow up listening to this folktale from their elders. It is a common story told to kids over many generations.

==Movie/s==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Keibu keioiba movie.jpg|thumb|Keibu keioiba, tigerhead film poster.]] --&gt;
A 2-D Manipuri animated film, titled as "keibu keioiba", has been made, directed by Bhumenjoy konsam, released in 2009, based on the original folktale. The movie has increased awareness of the story to the selfie-generation kids of present Manipur as well as to other communities.&lt;ref&gt;keibu keioiba / tigerhead&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2013 [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from the [[National Crime Agency#Organisational Structure|Human Trafficking Unit]] arrested two suspects at a residential address in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. A 73-year-old ethnic Indian [[Singaporean]] man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old [[Tanzanian]]&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for [[slavery]] and [[domestic servitude]].&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"/&gt; The case centred around the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]] commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers.  On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]] woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab),&lt;ref name="Sawer"/&gt; a 57-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old [[United Kingdom|British]] woman (Katy Morgan-Davies).&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women victims 'held for 30 years' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/women-victims-held-for-30-years-8954976.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.

==Perpetrator==
'''Aravindan Balakrishnan''' (known to his followers as "'''Comrade Bala'''") was born in [[Kerala]], [[India]] but migrated to  [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], where his father was a soldier, when he was 10.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Aravindan Balakrishnan: the Maoist cult leader who used brutal violence and rape to strip women of their dignity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12031312/Aravindan-Balakrishnan-the-Maoist-cult-leader-who-used-brutal-violence-and-rape-to-strip-women-of-their-dignity.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balakrishnan was a student at [[Raffles Institution]] and later the [[University of Singapore]], where although gaining a reputation as a "quiet chap",&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Reuters|title=UK Maoist cult leader raped followers, enslaved daughter|url=http://www.asiaone.com/world/uk-maoist-cult-leader-raped-followers-enslaved-daughter|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=AsiaOne|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a [[communist]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]], which the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] accused of engaging in "activities which are prejudicial to the security" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical "closely associated with [[Eurocommunists]]".&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO" /&gt; The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a [[fascist state]] due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a [[British Council]] scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and married his wife Chandra in 1971.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various [[sit-in]]s and protests. He was a regular attendee at [[London]] demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] and addressed the crowds.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

In 1974, Balakrishnan and his "small clique" were expelled from the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist)]] on account of "their pursuance of conspiratorial and [[wikt:splittist|splittist]] activities ... spreading [[social fascist]] slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement" and attempting "to put themselves above the discipline of the Party".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm "Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)"], ''The Marxist-Leninist'', 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org. Quoted in Nick Cohen [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/nick-cohen/2013/11/cultists-communists-too-close-to-us-for-comfort/ "Cultists &amp; communists – too close to us for comfort"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The CPE(M–L) "repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted" by Balakrishnan in "opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"/&gt; In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the ''South London Workers' Bulletin'', which accused the CPE(M–L) of being "fascists" and "agents of imperialism".&lt;ref name="Ford-WW-989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Eddie|title=Maoist 'slaves': Combating the fascist state in Brixton  - Weekly Worker|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/989/maoist-slaves-combating-the-fascist-state-in-brixt/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Weekly Worker|issue=989|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to "build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities",&lt;ref name="On Building a"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought|title=On Building a Revolutionary Stable Base Area|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/stable-base.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[South London]], and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining [[trade unions]], describing them as agents of the "imperialist fascist bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=Inside the paranoid Maoist cults of 1970s Britain|url=http://theconversation.com/inside-the-paranoid-maoist-cults-of-1970s-britain-20739|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Conversation|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title [[Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Following [[Mao Zedong#Death and aftermath|Mao's death in 1976]], the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, [[Brixton]], which also functioned as a communist collective of "thirteen comrades", with "13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)".&lt;ref name="On Building a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970’s|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was "notorious for violence" and "anything could happen".&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Maoist 'cult' leader denies rape as he claims female commune members competed for his affections|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12019410/Maoist-cult-leader-denies-rape-as-he-claims-female-commune-members-competed-for-his-affections.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Telegraph|date=26 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed  involved "over 200 police", including officers from the [[Special Patrol Group]], "under the pretext of searching for drugs", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised,&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented "JACKIE" (an acronym for [[Jehovah]], [[Allah]], [[Christ]], [[Krishna]] and [[Eknath Easwaran|Immortal Easwaran]]) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|title=My 30 years as prisoner of a London cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/katy-morgan-davies-interview-balakrishnan-cult-brixton-survivor|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was "the elixir of life", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of "jealousy" for his lover.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2" /&gt;

==Victims==
*[[Katy Morgan-Davies]] - born in 1983, she was originally named Prem Maopinduzi Davies. She began calling herself "Rosie" in her teens. She has subsequently changed her name to Katy Morgan-Davies, after the American singer [[Katy Perry]]. She is the biological daughter of Balakrishnan and Sian Davies.&lt;ref name = "growing up"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932|title=Growing up a prisoner in a cult|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=28 January 2017|author=Vanessa Engle|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan-Davies was brought up entirely isolated from the outside world and never went to a nursery, school, dentist or doctor. She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sian Davies]] - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan.  On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later.  After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the time of Davie's death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother.

*[[Aishah Wahab]] - a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Oh Kar Eng]] - nurse from [[Malaysia]] who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day.{{r|bbc}} The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Josephine Herivel]] - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] before she joined the group.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Her father, [[John Herivel]] was one of the [[Bletchley Park]] [[codebreakers]] who helped Britain and its allies win [[World War II]]. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state.{{r|bbc}}

==Imprisonment and rescue==

On 11 December 2014, it emerged that Balakrishnan had been charged with offences relating to cruelty to a person under 16, four counts of rape and 17 counts of indecent assault.

'''Liath Luachra''', the "'''Gray of Luachair'''", is the name of two characters in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. Both appear in ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'', which details the young life and adventures of the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]].

The first Liath Luachra is one of Fionn's foster mothers who raise him after the death of his father [[Cumhal]] at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. She is a great warrior and a companion of Fionn's aunt, the druidess [[Bodhmall]]; together they raise the boy in secret in the forest of [[Slieve Bloom Mountains|Sliabh Bladhma]]. Eventually Fionn's ever-spreading fame threatens to bring his father's killers to him, and his caretakers send him to find his own way. By this point they have taught him enough that he can survive on his own, and he goes into the king of [[Bantry]]'s service.

The second Liath Luachra is a tall, hideous warrior and a member of the [[Fianna]]. He had been an enemy of Cumhal, and even dealt him the first blow in the battle at which he died. Later Goll mac Morna gave him possession of Cumhal's treasures, and made him the Fianna's official treasurer. His ''corrbolg'' or ''crane bag'' is one of the warrior band's great treasures. Eventually he kills a young warrior named Glonda; Fionn sees the man's mother crying blood over the murder and decides to avenge him. He kills Liath easily and takes his treasure from him. This Liath has a son, [[Conán mac Lia]], who becomes lord of Luchair and a marauder against Fionn and the Fianna. He is eventually reconciled with the group and joins them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15524">The entries in this tabulation cover some 150 years in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the private residents of [[Covent Garden]] included many people of rank and note. They ranged from [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|marquesses to barons]], foreign ambassadors and members of parliament to physicians, surgeons, antiquaries, artists, authors and dramatists. Some of the later arrivals were auctioneers, such as Christopher Cock and [[Abraham Langford]], who found rich sources for future sales amongst their neighbours. 

Most of the entries are derived from ''The Piazza: Notable private residents in the Piazza'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Piazza: Notable private residents in the Piazza | website = British History Online | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, University of London | date = | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol36/pp96-97 | access-date = 10 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is based on Sheppard's ''Survey of London: Volume 36, Covent Garden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Survey of London: Volume 36, Covent Garden | website = British History Online | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, University of London | date = | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol36 | access-date = 18 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources are noted where appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">'''The Little Tough Guys''' (later billed as 'The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys') were a group of actors who made a series of films and serials released by [[Universal Studios]] from 1938 through 1943.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]], and several of them later became members of [[East Side Kids|The East Side Kids]] and [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
The urban drama ''Dead End'' became both a successful play and a hit movie, featuring six young actors playing streetwise guttersnipes: [[Billy Halop]], [[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Bobby Jordan]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]. The troupe became known as [[The Dead End Kids]] and starred in a series of features for [[Warner Brothers]].

==Little Tough Guys==
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] borrowed the Dead End Kids (except Gorcey and Jordan) for a juvenile-delinquency drama called ''[[Little Tough Guy]]''. Universal adopted this as a brand name, and turned the film into a series of 'Little Tough Guys' features. The studio filled out the cast with David Gorcey (Leo's younger brother) and [[Hal E. Chester|Hally Chester]]. 

The next three films did not include any of the original Dead End Kids. ''Little Tough Guys in Society'' (1939) was more of a lightweight comedy, while the next two, ''Newsboys' Home'' and ''Code of the Streets'' (1939), were more dramatic. [[Jackie Cooper]] starred in ''Newsboys' Home'', but was not a member of the team. Only David Gorcey and Hally Chester remained from the first film, ''Little Tough Guy''. This was the beginning of the members of the team changing on almost a film-to-film basis. Eleven actors drifted in and out of the series, including [[Frankie Thomas]], Charles Duncan (who was originally hired to play Leo Gorcey's role in the play ''Dead End''), and [[Billy Benedict]]. 

When Warners released Bobby Jordan from his contract, Universal quickly signed him to join the rest of gang. Now, with five of the original six Dead End Kids on the payroll, Universal revised the billing to read "The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys". In total, the Little Tough Guys made 12 feature films, and three 12-chapter serials. Leading player Halop joined the armed forces and was replaced by Jordan for the final film in the series, ''Keep 'Em Slugging'', released in 1943.

[[Shemp Howard]] of the [[Three Stooges]] appeared in ''Give Us Wings'', ''Hit The Road'' and ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]]''. Huntz Hall cited Howard as a major influence when his later "Bowery Boys" series shifted to all-out slapstick comedy.

There was still a market for these tough-teen films, and most of the Little Tough Guys principals wound up at [[Monogram Pictures]] as [[The East Side Kids]] and [[The Bowery Boys]].

'''Margaret Ann Neve''' (''née'' '''Harvey'''; 18 May 1792 – 4 April 1903) was the first recorded female [[supercentenarian]] and the second validated human to reach the age of 110 after [[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]]. She lived at [[Saint Peter Port]] on the island of [[Guernsey]] in the [[English Channel]]. She was also the first proven individual whose life spanned three centuries (18th to the 20th centuries).

==Family==
By Margaret's birth her family was already well-established on the island. Her father John Harvey was born in Cornwall in 1771 to John (1736-1778) and Margaret Ann Parker (d.1790). John Harvey was involved in merchant shipping and [[privateer]]ing, earning a great amount of wealth over the years. He married Elizabeth Harvey (''née'' Guille) when they were both 19. John died on 4 December 1820 at the age of 49, and  Elizabeth lived with her remaining children in a house called "Chaumière" ("The Cottage"), which he had bought in 1808.&lt;ref name="Priaulx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |title=The Harvey Family |work=Priaulx Library |date=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022135751/http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |archivedate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth died in 1871 at the age of 99.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Together they had seven children:
* Margaret (1792-1903)
* John (1793-1865) - married Anne Sophia Grut (1802-1844) in 1826 and moved to Jersey, then England. They had a son named Thomas, who served in the militia and became a merchant.
* Elizabeth (1796-) - never married.
* Maria (1799) and Augusta (1801) had died as infants.
* Thomas (1803) emigrated to the United States.
* Augusta (1804) - married.
* Louisa (1805-1821)

==Early life and marriage==
Born Margaret Harvey on 18 May 1792, the eldest of seven children, most of her childhood was spent in [[Guernsey]]. Early in her life she survived a fall down the stairs, which left her [[concussion|concussed]] for three days.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve, as she would become, could remember the turmoil that the [[French Revolution]] brought to Guernsey; at the time, her father was in command of the militia on the island. In 1807, at the age of 15, Neve set sail for [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] with her father, but a storm caused the ship to land at [[Chesil Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/chambersofcommerce/guernsey-1808-9.pdf |title=Guernsey (Channel Islands) chamber of commerce, members in 1808-9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

She was educated in [[Bristol]], England, gaining an interest in literature and poetry. In 1815, she went to a "finishing school" in Brussels, becoming fluent in French and Italian and able to converse in German and Spanish. She would read the [[New Testament]] in Greek.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

With her headmistress, she visited the battlefield of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], shortly after [[Battle of Waterloo|the battle]], once the corpses had been buried. There, Margaret picked up souvenirs which she showed to Prussian Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] in London.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Neve met with [[Charles François Dumouriez]], a general of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], who dubbed her "la spirituelle".&lt;ref name="neve1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|pages=10|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1903-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret married John Neve, born 1779, from [[Tenterden]], Kent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/19/101990032.pdf |title=The Late Mrs Neve |work=NY Times |date=19 April 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St Peter Port (Town) church on 18 January 1823. On their honeymoon, they visited the Waterloo battlefield, 8 years after the battle.&lt;ref name="ST03"&gt;{{cite news |title=AGED 110 YEARS |publisher=The Straits Times |date=7 May 1903 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in England for 25 years of marriage, but when her husband died in 1849, she returned to Guernsey.&lt;ref name="neve2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Her Hundred-and-eighth Birthday|pages=3|work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1900-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.

== Later life and death ==

The census for 1871 shows Margaret A. Neve (78) and her sister Elizabeth Harvey (73) living at 'Chaumière', Rouge Huis, St Peter Port, Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;RG10-5765-222-1&lt;/ref&gt; Neve traveled abroad to various countries with Elizabeth.  Their last trip was in 1872, when Neve was 80, wherein they visited the Polish city of [[Krakow]] (then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]).&lt;ref name="neve2" /&gt;

On 18 May 1899, a reception was held at [[Rouge Huis]] to celebrate her 107th birthday and her entrance into her 108th year. The town council, [[jurat]]s, the officers of the staff, and about 250 of the leading residents attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unexampled Longevity. |pages=21 |work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1899-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her age, Margaret was found making [[marmalade]] the next morning by a reporter from ''[[The Times]]''. She was reported as never being ill until the age of 105, when she had the flu, followed by bronchitis at 108. At the age of 110, she climbed a tree to pluck an apple, explaining that they were much tastier when eaten straight from the tree.&lt;ref name="BIB"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glen |last=Balfour-Pau |title=Bagpipes in Babylon: A Lifetime in the Arab World and Beyond |ISBN=9781845111519 |publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

A newspaper report records that she enjoyed a glass and a half of old sherry at lunchtime, followed by a weak whiskey and water at supper. She was in the habit of always rising early and abstaining from eating and drinking between meal times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Oldest Woman in the World |publisher=arence and Richmond Examiner |date=19 February 1901 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, she did not receive congratulations from [[Queen Victoria]] congratulating her for reaching her 110th birthday. However, the Harvey family (through Neve's niece Louisa) did exchange correspondence with the Royal Household, expressing gratitude for the signed photograph given to them on 4 May 1896 by the Queen.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve died on 4 April 1903, a month before her 111th birthday. She reportedly repeated a [[Psalm]] in a loud voice the day before she died. Flags in Guernsey were lowered to half mast as a show of respect.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|20}} She was one of the last few living people from the 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1226">The '''Masters of Dirc van Delf''' were a group of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript painters]] active in the [[Netherlands]] between 1400 and around 1410. The name has been appended to several unknown artists who together make up an important [[studio]] of illuminators, one of the first important ones known from fifteenth-century Holland. Their name is derived from the lavish work they did to illustrate devotional texts by [[Dirc van Delf]], court chaplain to [[Albert I, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht of Bavaria]] from 1389 until 1404 in [[The Hague]]. The studio's artists combined with Dirc to play an important role in the new cultural life of the royal court in the Netherlands.

Paintings by the Masters may be found in the collections of the [[Getty Center|J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

The '''Munros of Auchinbowie''' (sometimes spelt Monro) are a distinguished branch of the [[Scotland|Scottish]], highland [[Clan Munro]]. From this family three Professors of Anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland were produced, as well as several other doctors and military officers.

==Lineage==
===17th century===
[[File:Monro_RCSEd.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]] the surgeon of Edinburgh University whose descendants later succeeded to the Auchinbowie property]]
The progenitor of the Munros of Auchinbowie is generally regarded as [[Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts]] who served as a major in an infantry regiment and saw action at the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651.  He later took up a career of politics. His ancestry can be traced to [[Munro of Milntown|Andrew Munro, 4th of Milntown]] who descends from [[Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis]] (d.1425), an early chief of the Clan Munro of Ross-shire, Scotland.

Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts had seven children:

#[[George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie]] (1666–1721) who was famed for his victory over the Jacobites at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] in 1689.  He came into ownership of Auchinbowie, a property about four miles south of [[Stirling]] through his wife Margaret Bruce of Auchinbowie. Later as a Major in Sir Charles Graham's Regiment of Foot he fought at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)]].   
#Archibald Munro born in 1666 and died in 1697.
#[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]] a surgeon at the [[University of Edinburgh]], whose descendants would later succeed to the estates of Auchinbowie.
#Margaret Munro.
#Lillias Munro.
#Jean Munro. Married William, second son of Sir William Sempil of Cathcart.
#Mary Munro.

===18th century===
George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie had three children:
[[File:Auchibowie House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Auchinbowie House, near [[Stirling]], [[Scotland]]]]
#Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie who married Anne, daughter of [[Stewart Baronets|Sir Robert Stewart, Lord Tillicoultry]] in 1719.
#[[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] (1700–1757) who was a British Army officer famed for his resolute but ultimately unsuccessful defense of [[Fort William Henry]] in 1757 during the [[Seven Years' War]] / [[French and Indian War]] which was made famous by the novel and later the film ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. However, when [[John Alexander Inglis]] wrote his history of the Monro of Auchinbowie family in 1911, he had not at that time identified the younger George Monro as a member of the family.&lt;ref name="Inglis2"&gt;Holden, James A. and Inglis, John Alexander. (1913). ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42889472?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Lineage of Colonel George Monro - Proceedings of the New York State Historical Association]''. '''Volume 13'''. pp. 389 - 403.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Margaret Munro - born 1707.

Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie (d.1742)  had nine children: 
#George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie (1721–1793) who was an army surgeon who served in the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd Highlanders]] otherwise known as the ''Black Watch'' under the chief of the Clan Munro; Colonel [[Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet]]. In 1750 George was Surgeon in [[William Maule, 1st Earl Panmure]]'s [[25th Regiment of Foot]]. He saw active service in Germany and afterwards in the war against the French in America. In 1781 he was appointed Physician General to the garrison in [[Menorca]] and went through six months siege by the French and Spanish.
#Alexander Munro, a writer in [[Edinburgh]]. (1724–1750).
#John Munro.
#Cecil Munro. (1719–1786)
#Five other children - all died young.

George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had two sons:

#Major George Munro who married Elizabeth Aylmer. They had two sons and one daughter.
#[[Hector William Munro|Lieutenant-General Hector William Munro, 1st of Edmondsham]] (d. 1821) was [[List of Governors of Trinidad|Governor of Trinidad]] and who married Philadelphia Bower of [[Edmondsham]]. They had three sons and four daughters.

==Alexander Monro (primus)==
[[File:Alexander Monro primus.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''primus'', 4th of Auchinbowie]]
Although George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had male heirs as mentioned above, he sold the Auchinbowie property to a cousin, [[Alexander Monro (primus)]] who was the son of [[John Monro (surgeon)]], who was in turn a younger brother of George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie. Alexander Monro (primus) was the founder of the [[Edinburgh Medical School]].  He was appointed lecturer on [[Anatomy]] by the Surgeons' Company at [[Edinburgh]] in 1719; two years later he became professor, and in 1725 was admitted to the [[University of Edinburgh|University]]. He was a principal promoter and early clinical lecturer in the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. Alexander Monro (primus) had six children:

#[[John Monro (advocate)|John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie]], advocate, born 5 November 1725 and married Sophia, eldest daughter of Archibald Inglis of Auchindinny. He died in May 1789.
#[[Donald Monro (doctor)|Dr Donald Monro]] (1728–1802), married Dorothea Maria Heineken.
#Jean Monro (1729–1731).
#Mary Monro - born 1730.
#[[Alexander Monro (secundus)]], 1st of Craiglockhart and Cockburn. (1733–1817)
#Margaret Monro (1757–1802).

==Alexander Monro (secundus)==
[[File:Alexander Munro secundus.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''secundus'']]
Alexander Monro (primus) was succeeded in the property of Auchibowie by his eldest son John Monro, 5th of Auchinbowie who was in turn succeeded by a daughter. However he was succeeded in his profession by his third son [[Alexander Monro (secundus)]] who was Professor of Anatomy in [[Edinburgh]]. He took his degree as Doctor of Medicine on 20 October 1775. He then proceeded to his studies abroad. He spent a short time in [[London]], where he attended the lectures of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|Dr William Hunter]]. He next visited [[Paris]] and on 17 September 1757 entered [[Leiden University]] where he formed a friendship with two famous anatomists, [[Bernhard Siegfried Albinus]] and [[Petrus Camper]]. However his foreign studies were principally prosecuted at [[Berlin]], where he worked under the celebrated Professor Meckel, in whose house he lived. Alexander spent some time in Edinburgh during early 1757 in order to fill the place of his father, who was confined to the house by illness. He finally was admitted a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] on 2 May 1758 and as a Fellow on 1 May 1759. He had four children:

#Isabella Monro who married Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Cott of Gala. She died in 1801.
#[[Alexander Monro (tertius)]], 2nd of Craiglockhart and Cockburn. (1773–1859).
#David Monro (1776–1843).
#Charlotte Monro (1782–1822).

==Alexander Monro (tertius)==
[[File:Alexander Munro tertius.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Alexander Monro ''tertius'']]
[[Alexander Monro (tertius)]] followed his father and grandfather in becoming professor of anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Amongst his publications are "Outlines of the Anatomy of the Human Body" (1811) in four volumes and "Elements of Anatomy" (1825) in two volumes. He was Secretary of the Royal College of Physicians from 1809 to 1819 and President in 1827 and 1828. He was also on the Council of the [[Wernerian Natural History Society]] of which he became a member in 1811. He had been elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1798 and at his death was father of the Society. He had 12 children:

#Alexander Monro (1803–1867), was a Captain in the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]], married Elizabeth, daughter of C. B Scott of Woll.
#James Monro (1806–1870), was a Surgeon-Major in the [[Coldstream Guards]], married Maria, daughter of Colonel Duffin.
#Henry Monro (1810–1869), married Jane Christie. One of their sons was [[Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet]]
#[[David Monro|Sir David Monro]] (1813–1877), married Dinah, daughter of John Secker. They had five sons including [[Charles John Monro]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright-St Clair, Rex. "Monro, David 1813 - 1877". Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Ministry for Culture and Heritage.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{New Netherland}}

The council of '''Nine Men''' was a citizens board and a form of representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous councils, the [[Twelve Men]] and the [[Eight Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council were elected in 1647, 1649, 1650 and 1652. On July 26, 1649, eleven current and former members of the board signed the ''Petition of the Commonality of New Netherland'', which requested that the States General take action to encourage [[economic freedom]] and force local government like that in the Netherlands, removing the colony from the control of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. It became the basis for the municipal government when the city of [[New Amsterdam]] received its charter in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = About the City Council   | publisher = New York City Council   | date =    | url = http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | accessdate = 2013-01-01   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120620053608/http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | archivedate = 2012-06-20   | df =    }} &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''posthumous name''' is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in [[East Asia]] after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during their life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of [[Table of Chinese monarchs|China]], [[List of Korean monarchs|Korea]], [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnam]], and [[emperors of Japan|Japan]].

Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles &amp;ndash; for example, to successful courtiers.

A posthumous name should not be confused with the [[era name]] and [[temple name]].

==Use==
The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler's current title. As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name, but rulers ''within'' a state would usually not repeat an already used name, the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity. In Chinese the whole construct is therefore "[state][adjective][title]", which in English is typically translated as "[title][adjective] of [state]", such as [[King Wen of Zhou]], [[Duke Mu of Qin]], and [[King Cheng of Chu]]. The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated.

While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters, the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result.

== History ==

===Origins===
Early mythological rulers such as [[Emperor Yao]] are considered to have posthumous names.&lt;ref&gt;''Yiwen Leiju'', vols. [[:zh:s:藝文類聚/卷014|014]]&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers of [[Shang Dynasty]] are known only by their posthumous names, as their personal names were not recorded in classical texts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the [[Zhou dynasty]], such as [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], used "posthumous names" during their lifetime, but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler's death. As a result, final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate (such as usurpers) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names, e.g. [[Jian, King of Qi]]; [[Min, Marquis of Jin]]; and [[Chen Tuo]].

The use of posthumous names was stopped in the [[Qin Dynasty]], because [[Qin Shi Huang]] proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants, or "later emperors" to judge their elders, or the "prior emperors" (先帝). The practice was revived in the [[Han Dynasty]] after the demise of Qin.

===Decline in use===
Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty. In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as "Wen" (cultured) or "Wu" (martial). However, as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors. By the time of the [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|first emperor of Tang]] the length had grown to 7 characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their [[temple name]] (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or [[era name]] (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use.

===Later developments===

Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a blood line apparent. The rule was also followed by non-[[Han Chinese]] rulers of [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], [[Silla]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Vietnam]], [[Western Xia]], [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. King names of [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] and [[List of legendary monarchs of Korea#Mahan|Mahan]] also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work.

Some rulers, such as [[Wu Zetian]], or rebel leaders also had similar style [[regnal name]]s when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. [[Emperor Aizong of Jin]] and [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had different names from different people. [[Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui]], of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/xhfk/2010-08/11/c_12433570.htm 韩侂胄——《宋史》中的一缕冤魂]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Song dynasty few received bad names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc 從文臣諡號看明清諡法理論，宋秉仁] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152451/http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad monarchs of the [[Joseon dynasty]] did not receive posthumous names.

Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The [[Guangxu Emperor]], who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, sports the impressive 21-character title of "Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing".

[[Puyi]], the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]], when such practices would have been thought feudal.

Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (d.1908), in Vietnam with the [[Khải Định|Khải Định Emperor]] (d.1925) and in Korea with the [[Sunjong of Korea|Yunghui Emperor]] (d.1926). However, in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to [[Crown Prince Euimin]] and [[Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun]].

===Contemporary Japanese use===
Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan. A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name, which beginning with [[Emperor Meiji]] (d.1912) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long. The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of [[Hirohito|Emperor Showa]] (d.1989).

A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]] known as ''kaimyo'', but is in practice still referred to by the living name.

==Guidelines==

===Selection===
Posthumous names can be praises (褒字) or deprecations (貶字). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called ''respectful names'' (尊號 zūn hào) in Chinese. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names.&lt;ref&gt;明朱睦《易学识遗》辑古谥法十二家，曰《史记谥法解》，曰《周书谥法》，曰《蔡邕独断谥法》，曰《苏洵谥法》，曰《周公谥法》，曰《春秋谥法》，曰《广谥法》，曰《沈约谥法》，曰《贺琛谥法》，曰《扈蒙谥法》，曰《郑樵谥法》，曰《陈思谥法》&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those guidelines:

* Praises
** Those having a persistent and reasonable governance (剛強直理) are called "Martial" (武 wǔ). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who sympathize with the people and recognize their needs (憫民會椅) are called "Civil" (文 wén). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who respect the talented and value righteousness (尊賢貴義) are called "Reverent" (恭 gòng).
** Those who are kind and benevolent in nature (溫柔賢善) are called "Benign" (懿 yì).
** Those who aid the people out of righteousness (由義而濟) are called "Admirable" (景 jǐng).
** Those who treat the people compassionately with a gentle quality (柔質慈民) are called "Compassionate" (惠 huì).
** Those who eliminate destructions and purge cruelty (除殘去虐) are called "Tang" (湯 tāng). Possibly named after the revered ruler [[Cheng Tang]] (成湯), the founder of the [[Shang Dynasty]].
** Those who make the people feel satisfied with their policies (安民立政) are called "Constructive" (成 chéng). Again, possibly named after Cheng Tang.
** Those who are considerate and far-sighted (果慮果遠) are called "Brilliant" (明 míng).
** Those who preach their virtue and righteousness to the people (布德執義) are called "Majestic" (穆 mù).
** Those who are aggressive to expand their realm (辟土服遠) are called "Exploratory" (桓 huán).
** "Highly (respected)" (高 gāo) is particularly reserved for the founders of dynasties.
* Deprecations
** Those who lived short lives without much accomplishment (短折不成) are called "Passed Away Prematurely" (殤 shāng).
** Those who have a constant twinge of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (often due to political plights) during their governance (在國遭憂) are called "Pitiful" (愍 mǐn).
** Those who lose their spouses and pass away at their early age (蚤孤短折) are called "Lamentable" (哀 āi).
** Those who are obliged to make sacrifices to their ancestors (肆行勞祀) are called "Mournful" (悼 dào). 
&lt;!---   ** Those who are () are called "" ( ). --&gt;

However, most of these qualifications are subjective, repetitive, and highly [[stereotypical]]; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.

When combining an emperor's temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] whose full posthumous name would be "Shi Zu - Zhang Huang Di" (世祖章皇帝), combining the last 2 characters of his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name, which is the form most commonly seen in old documents. A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the [[Chinese sovereign]] entry. The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long, for example [[Hongwu Emperor]], [[Nurhaci]], [[:zh:朝鮮文祖|Crown Prince Hyomyeong]], [[Sunjo of Joseon]] and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines. Some monarchs of [[Ju (state)|Ju]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]] used place names. Some monarchs of [[Yue (state)]] had Chinese transliterated posthumous names. Some monarchs of [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] had different style posthumous names. Some early Japan monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names (和風諡号).

==China==

===Emperors and empresses===

All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the [[Chinese character|characters]] for "[[emperor of China|emperor]]", ''Huángdì'' (皇帝, i.e. emperor), which can be shortened to ''Dì''; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only ''Dì'' and no ''Huáng''.

Starting with Emperor [[Emperor Wen of Han|Xiaowen of Han]] (more commonly "Emperor Wen"), every single Han emperor, except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has the character of "[[filial piety|filial]]" (孝 xiào) at the beginning of his posthumous names. "Filial" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties. For Qing emperors, 孝 xiào is placed in various position in the string of characters, while those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names, 孝 xiào is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names was increasing. The emperors of the [[Tang Dynasty]] have names in between seven and eighteen characters. Those in the [[Qing Dynasty]] have twenty-one characters. For instance, that of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was "The Emperor of Order who Observes the Heavenly Rituals with a Solemn Fate, Destined to Unify, Establishes with Extreme Talented Insights, Admires the Arts, Manifests the Might, with Great Virtue and Vast Achievement, Reaches Humanity, Purely Filial" (體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝,  {{Audio|Chinese-Emperor Shunzhi posthumous name.ogg|Listen to pronunciation}}: tǐ tiān lóng yùn dìng tǒng jiàn jí yīng ruì qīn wén xiǎn wǔ dà dé hóng gōng zhì rén chún xiào zhāng huáng dì).

The woman with the longest posthumous name is [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who is "The Empress who is Admirably Filial, Initiates Kindness, with Blessed Health, Manifests Much Contentment, Solemn Sincerity, with Longevity, Provides Admiration Prosperously, Reveal Adoration, Prosperous with a Merry Heaven, with a Holy Appearance" (孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇后 xiào qīn cí xǐ duān yòu kāng yí zhāo yù zhuāng chéng shòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xīng shèng xiǎn huáng hòu), or 孝欽顯皇后 for short.

===Imperial family===

According to the noble system since the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings (or Princes), Dukes, Earls, etc., with or without actual control over a region of land. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. For example, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] was posthumously named Zhong (忠), and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng); [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] was posthumous named Xian (賢), hence is referred Prince Chunxian (醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng).

===Officials===
It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles, especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered [[canonization]] in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church, though the process is not nearly as long. See [[List of Posthumous Names]] for some examples.

[[Confucius]] has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty. One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī 至聖先師.

Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his own family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (Sĩshì, 私諡). For example, [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] was given ''Sishi'' Jìngjié 靖節.

==Korea==
In [[Korea]], [[Goguryeo]] kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places, or in case of [[Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto]], the name described his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3006407|title=Of tombs and posthumous names|date=2015-07-09|accessdate=2016-06-03|publisher=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Silla]], every monarchs were given the titles of ''wang'' (왕, "king") with two characters in posthumous names from [[Jijeung of Silla]]. On the other hand, all posthumous names for kings of [[Balhae]] were restricted to one character.

Most of the kings of [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] were called [[temple name]] more than posthumous name unlike dynasties of ancient Korea. This is a longer name, made up of adjectives characteristic of the king's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/common/printpreview.asp?categoryCode=628&amp;newsIdx=153615|title=Rediscovering aesthetics of Jongmyo Shrine |publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/korea/01_notes.php|title=Korea: Notes|publisher=archontology.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000927530|title=조선시대 국왕호칭의 종류와 의미  The Kinds and Meaning of King's Name in the Chosun Dynasty|publisher=NRF|journal=역사와경계 |year=2004|issue=52|pages=46–67|language=English, Korean|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s posthumous name was Hongdoseon Yeolpyeongse Sukheonui Hyoganghye Daeseong Daewang (홍도선열평세숙헌의효강혜대성대왕), while his temple name was Gwangjong. Details of the system of posthumous name were made during the Joseon Dynasty. During the Joseon Dynasty, After five days the king's funeral, officials discussed and decided the king's posthumous name. The Ministry of Culture and Education (예조, 禮曹) was in charge of the naming. Also, Shorn of his power, the deposed king has not been given any posthumous names with temple name unless reinstated. They were degraded to the rank of ''gun'' (군, "prince"). [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsan-gun]] and [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghae-gun]] were are notable examples.

[[Crown Prince Hyomyeong]] has been given longest posthumous names in Korea. He were posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with with 113 characters in posthumous names in 1899.

==Japan==
In Japan, posthumous names are called ''shigō'' (諡号), ''okuri-na'' (諡), or ''tsuigo'' (追号). Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called ''teigō'' (帝号, "emperor name[s]").

There are two styles in emperors' posthumous names, namely Chinese style and Japanese style. In addition to the appellation ''Tennō'' (天皇, "heavenly sovereign", usually translated as ''Emperor'') that is a part of all Japanese emperors' posthumous name, most of them consist of two [[kanji]] characters, although a few consist of three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for [[Emperor Jimmu]] and [[Emperor Antoku]], for example. Others are given immediately after death, like that of [[Emperor Monmu]].

Many have Chinese-style names, for example:
* [[Emperor Jimmu]] (神武天皇 ''Jinmu Tennō'', lit. ''Divine Might'')
* [[Emperor Nintoku]] (仁徳天皇 ''Nintoku Tennō'', lit. ''Humane  Virtue'')
* [[Emperor Ōjin]] (応神天皇 ''Ōjin Tennō'', lit. ''Answering the Gods'')

Some have Japanese-style names. For example:
* those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
** [[Emperor Saga]] (嵯峨天皇 ''Saga Tennō''), named after a [[palace]] (院 ''in'')
** [[Emperor Ichijo|Emperor Ichijō]] (一条天皇 ''Ichijō Tennō''), named after an official residence (邸 ''tei'')
** [[Emperor Kōmyō]] (光明天皇 ''Kōmyō Tennō''), named after a [[temple]]
** [[Emperor Higashiyama]] (東山天皇 ''Higashiyama Tennō''), named after a [[hill]]
* those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding ''Go'' (後, lit. ''latter'') as a prefix to the earlier emperor's name:
** [[Emperor Go-Ichijo|Emperor Go-Ichijō]]  (後一条天皇 ''Go-Ichijō Tennō'')
** [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (後醍醐天皇 ''Go-Daigo Tennō'')
** [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 ''Go-Sakuramachi Tennō'')
* those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors' names:
** [[Empress Genmei|Empress Gen'''mei''']] (元明天皇 ''Genmei Tennō'') + [[Empress Genshō|Empress Gen'''shō''']] (元正天皇 ''Genshō Tennō'') = [[Empress Meishō|Empress '''Meishō''']] (明正天皇 ''Meishō Tennō'')
** [[Empress Kōken|Empress '''Shō'''toku]] (称徳天皇 ''Shōtoku Tennō'') + [[Emperor Kōnin|Emperor '''Kō'''nin]] (光仁天皇 ''Kōnin Tennō'') = [[Emperor Shōkō|Emperor '''Shōkō''']] (称光天皇 ''Shōkō Tennō'')

Since the death of [[Emperor Meiji]] (明治天皇 ''Meiji Tennō'') in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his [[Japanese era name|era]].  For example, after his death, [[Hirohito]] (by which he is usually called outside Japan) was formally renamed '''Emperor Shōwa''' (昭和天皇 ''Shōwa Tennō'') after [[Shōwa period|his era]]; Japanese now refer to him by only that name. ''Hirohito'' was his given name; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names, [[Naming taboo#In other countries|as it is considered disrespectful]].

The '''Rat Pack''' is a term used by the media to refer to an informal group of entertainers centered on the [[Las Vegas]] casino scene.  Having its origins in a group of friends that met at the Los Angeles home of [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], by the 1960s, it was the name used by the press and the general public to refer to a later variation of the group that called itself "the Summit" or "the Clan", featuring [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]] and [[Joey Bishop]] among others; they appeared together on stage and in films in the early 1960s, including the movies ''[[Ocean's 11]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=michel, peter |url=http://www.library.unlv.edu/speccol/dino/ratpack.html |title=UNLV Libraries, The Rat Pack, retrieved May 2, 2007 |publisher=Library.unlv.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908094745/http://www.library.unlv.edu/speccol/dino/ratpack.html |archivedate=September 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sergeants 3]]'', and ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' (in the last film, [[Bing Crosby]] replaced Lawford). Sinatra, Martin, and Davis were regarded as the group's lead members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-movie-portal.com/sergeants-3-1962/ |title=Sergeants 3 (1962) |publisher=The Movie Portal |date=1962-02-10 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hmv.com/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?sku=877346 |title=Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra: Dean Martin: Sammy Davis Jr): Big Three: 3cd (2008): CD |publisher=hmv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s==
[[File:Sabrina9.jpg|left|thumb|[[Humphrey Bogart]], original Rat Pack leader (from [[Sabrina (1954 film)|''Sabrina'', 1954]])]]
The name "The Rat Pack" was first used to refer to a group of friends in New York.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shawn Levy, ''Rat Pack confidential'', Doubleday, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Lawrence J. Quirk and William Schoel, ''The Rat Pack'', Taylor Publishing Company 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Several explanations have been offered for the famous name over the years.  According to one version, the group's original "Den Mother", [[Lauren Bacall]], after seeing her husband, [[Humphrey Bogart]], and his friends return from a night in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], said words to the effect of "You look like a goddamn rat pack."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Rat Pack" may also be a shortened version of "[[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California|Holmby Hills]] Rat Pack", a reference to the home of Bogart and Bacall&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; which served as a regular hangout.

Visiting members included [[Errol Flynn]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Cesar Romero]].

According to Stephen Bogart, the original members of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack were: Frank Sinatra (pack master), [[Judy Garland]] (first vice-president), Nicole Bassing (den mother), [[Sid Luft]] (cage master), Bogart (rat in charge of public relations), [[Swifty Lazar]] (recording secretary and treasurer), [[Nathaniel Benchley]] (historian), [[David Niven]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[George Cukor]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Rex Harrison]], and [[Jimmy Van Heusen]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In his autobiography ''[[The Moon's a Balloon]]'', David Niven confirms that the Rat Pack originally included him but neither Sammy Davis, Jr. nor Dean Martin.

==1960s==
The 1960s version of the group included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Joey Bishop]]. [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Juliet Prowse]], [[Buddy Greco]], and [[Shirley MacLaine]] were often referred to as the "Rat Pack Mascots". 

The post-Bogart version of the group (Bogart died in 1957) was reportedly never called that name by any of its members – they called it ''the Summit'' or ''the Clan''. "The Rat Pack" was a term used by journalists and outsiders, although it remains the lasting name for the group.

Often, when one of the members was scheduled to give a performance, the rest of the Pack would show up for an impromptu show, causing much excitement among audiences, resulting in return visits. They sold out almost all of their appearances, and people would come pouring into Las Vegas, sometimes sleeping in cars and hotel lobbies when they could not find rooms, just to be part of the Rat Pack entertainment experience. The Rat Pack's appearances were of unprecedented value because the city would always become flooded with [[high roller]]s, wealthy gamblers who would routinely leave substantial fortunes in the casinos' coffers. The marquees of the hotels at which they were performing as individuals would read, for example, "DEAN MARTIN - MAYBE FRANK - MAYBE SAMMY" as seen on a [[Sands Hotel]] sign.

Peter Lawford was a brother-in-law of President [[John F. Kennedy]] (dubbed "Brother-in-Lawford" by Sinatra),&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; and Kennedy spent time with Sinatra and the others when he visited Las Vegas, during which members sometimes referred to the group as "the Jack Pack". Rat Pack members played a role in campaigning for Kennedy and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], appearing at the July 1960 [[Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford had asked Sinatra if he would have Kennedy as a guest at his [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] house in March 1962, and Sinatra went to great lengths (including the construction of a [[helipad]]) to accommodate the President.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, pp. 292-293&lt;/ref&gt; When Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] advised his brother to sever his ties to Sinatra because of the entertainer's association with Mafia figures such as [[Sam Giancana]], the stay was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p.293&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy instead chose to stay at rival [[Bing Crosby]]'s estate, which further infuriated Sinatra.&lt;ref name="Spada1"&gt;Spada, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford was blamed for this, and Sinatra "never again had a good word for [him]" from that point onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford's role in the upcoming ''[[4 for Texas]]'' was written out, and his part in ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' was given to Bing Crosby.&lt;ref name="Spada1"/&gt;

On June 20, 1965, Sinatra, Martin, and Davis, with [[Johnny Carson]] as the [[Master of Ceremonies|emcee]] (substituting for Bishop, who was out with a bad back), performed their only televised concert together during the heyday of the Pack at the [[Peabody Opera House|Kiel Opera House]] in St. Louis, a closed-circuit broadcast done as a fundraiser for Dismas House (the first halfway house for ex-convicts) and fed live to movie theatres across the country. Thirty years later [[Paul Brownstein]] tracked down a print of the "lost" show in a St. Louis closet after someone noticed mysterious cameras onstage during a CBS documentary on Sinatra which filmed part of the show. It has since been broadcast on [[Nick at Nite]] (in 1998) as part of The [[Museum of Television &amp; Radio]] Showcase series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvclassics.com/ratpack.htm |title=The Rat Pack Captured |publisher=Tvclassics.com |date=1965-06-20 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on DVD as part of the ''Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live &amp; Swingin''.

==Later years==
In 1981, [[Dean Martin]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], appeared together in the film ''[[Cannonball Run (film)|Cannonball Run]]'', and were joined by Sinatra in the sequel ''[[Cannonball Run II]]''. This would be the last time that the three would appear in a movie together ([[Shirley MacLaine]] also appears in the latter film).

==Revival==
[[File:Sammy Davis Jr 1989 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Sammy Davis, Jr. in 1989]]
In December 1987, at [[Chasen's]] restaurant in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, and Martin announced a 29-date tour, called ''Together Again''. At the press conference to announce the tour, Martin joked about calling the tour off, and Sinatra rebuked a reporter for using the term "Rat Pack", referring to it as "that stupid phrase".&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Shawn. ''Rat Pack Confidential''. Fourth Estate. London, 1999. p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Martin's son, [[Dean Paul Martin]], died in a plane crash in March 1987 on the [[San Gorgonio Mountain]] in California, the same mountain where Sinatra's mother, Dolly, was killed in a plane crash ten years earlier. Martin had since become increasingly dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs. Davis had hip replacement surgery two years previously, and was estranged from Sinatra because of Davis' use of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;Haygood, Wil. ''In Black and White: The Life of Sammy Davis, Jr.''.

New York, 2003. p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was also experiencing severe financial difficulties, and was promised by Sinatra's people that he could earn between six and eight million dollars from the tour.&lt;ref name="Haygood p. 466"&gt;Haygood p. 466&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin had not made a film or recorded since 1984, and Sinatra felt that the tour would be good for Martin, telling Davis, "I think it would be great for Dean. Get him out. For that alone it would be worth doing".&lt;ref name="Levy, p. 339"&gt;Levy, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra and Davis still performed regularly, yet had not recorded for several years. Both Sinatra and Martin had made their last film appearances together in 1984's ''Cannonball Run II'', a film which also starred Davis. This marked the trio's first feature film appearance since 1964's ''Robin and the 7 Hoods''. Martin expressed reservations about the tour, wondering whether they could draw as many people as they had in the past. After private rehearsals, at one of which Sinatra and Davis had complained about the lack of black musicians in the orchestra,&lt;ref name="Haygood p. 466"/&gt; the tour began at the [[Oracle Arena|Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena]] on March 13, 1988, to a sold-out crowd of 14,500.&lt;ref name="Levy, p. 339"/&gt; 

Davis opened the show, followed by Martin and then Sinatra; after an interval, the three performed a medley of songs. During the show, Martin threw a lit cigarette at the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Anthony, Swan, Robbyn. ''Sinatra: The Life''. Corgi. New York, 2006 p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin withdrew from the tour after just five shows, with the official reason stated as being a flare-up of a kidney problem. Sinatra and Davis continued the tour under the title "The Ultimate Event" with [[Liza Minnelli]] replacing Martin as the third member of the trio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Takiff |first1=Jonathan |title=Frank, Liza &amp; Sammy The Ultimate Event! |url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-09-27/news/26230935_1_susan-reynolds-sammy-davis-frank-sinatra |accessdate=2016-05-01 |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |date=1988-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis's associate stated that Sinatra's people were skimming the top of the revenues from the concerts, as well as stuffing envelopes full of cash into suitcases after the performances.&lt;ref&gt;Birkbeck, Matt. ''Deconstructing Sammy''. Amistad. New York, 2008. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1989, after Davis experienced throat pain, he was diagnosed with throat cancer which caused his death in May 1990. Davis was buried with a gold watch that Sinatra had given him at the conclusion of ''The Ultimate Event Tour''.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Swan, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1988 performance of ''The Ultimate Event'' in Detroit was recorded and shown on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] the following year as a tribute to the recently deceased Davis. A review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Davis's performance, describing him as "pure, ebullient, unapologetic show business."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957179,00.html |title= With Sammy Davis, the Spirit Lingers |accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=The New York Times | date=March 6, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
Concerning the group's reputation for womanizing and heavy drinking, [[Joey Bishop]] stated in a 1998 interview: "I never saw Frank, Dean, Sammy or Peter drunk during performances. That was only a gag! And do you believe these guys had to chase broads? They had to chase 'em away!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,139509,00.html time.com]{{spaced ndash}}

Archival footage of Lawford and Sinatra were used in the 1974 compilation film ''[[That's Entertainment!]]''.

[[Shirley MacLaine]] appeared in the 1958 film ''Some Came Running'' along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate [[David Niven]], and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his face toward the camera during a scene featuring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[George Raft]]. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]''. She also had an appearance in the 1960 film ''Ocean's 11'' as a drunken woman. The 1984 film ''Cannonball Run II'', with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.

A biopic, ''[[The Rat Pack (film)|The Rat Pack]]'', made by [[HBO]] in 1998, starred [[Ray Liotta]] as Sinatra, [[Joe Mantegna]] as Martin and [[Don Cheadle]] as Davis, dramatizing their private lives and, in particular, their roles in the 1960 presidential campaign of [[John F. Kennedy]].

==Music==
''[[Christmas with the Rat Pack]]'', a collection of holiday tunes sung by Sinatra, Martin and Davis, was released in 2001. ''[[The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live &amp; Swingin']]'' went on sale in 2003. A concert featuring the three men, ''[[Sands Hotel|Live from the Sands]]'' in [[Las Vegas]], also is available on CD.

==Stage==
''[[The Rat Pack: Live from Las Vegas]]'' tribute show originated on stage in [[London]] in 2000 and has been running continuously since then throughout Europe and North America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8913">[[Image:Sanjūrokkasen-gaku - 8 - Kanō Tan’yū - Sōjō Henjō.jpg|thumb|''Sōjō [[Henjō]]'' by [[Kanō Tan'yū]], 1648]]The {{nihongo|'''Rokkasen'''|六歌仙||"six poetry immortals"}} are six [[Japanese poetry|Japanese poets]] of the mid-ninth century who were named by [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] in the ''[[kana]]'' and ''[[Kanji|mana]]'' prefaces to the [[List of Japanese poetry anthologies|poetry anthology]] ''[[Kokin Wakashū|Kokin wakashū]]'' (c. 905–14) as notable poets of the generation before its compilers.

== History of the term ==
In their original appearance in the prefaces of the ''Kokin wakashū'', the six ''rokkasen'' are not actually referred to with this term.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nishiyama |first=Hidehito |date=March 2007 |title=Rokkasen no jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40015229403 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=46 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous phrases that show the conceptualization of these six as a cohesive group, but the term "Rokkasen" first appeared in an early Kamakura-period commentary on ''Kokin wakashū'', titled ''Sanryūshō'' 三流抄.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1986|title=Rokkasen|encyclopedia=Waka Daijiten|publisher=Meiji Sho-in|last=Masuda|first=Shigeo|date=|page=1083|language=ja|editor1-last=Inukai|editor1-first=Kiyoshi|editor2-last=Inoue|editor2-first=Muneo|editor3-last=Ohkubo|editor3-first=Tadashi|editor4-last=Ono|editor4-first=Hiroshi|editor5-last=Tanaka|editor5-first=Yutaka|editor6-last=Hashimoto|editor6-first=Fumio|editor7-last=Fujihira|editor7-first=Haruo|trans-title=The Six Poetry Immortals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The members of the ''rokkasen'', and their total poems in ''Kokin wakashū,'' are as follows:
*[[Ōtomo no Kuronushi]], 3 poems
*[[Ono no Komachi]], 18 poems
*[[Ariwara no Narihira]], 30 poems
*[[Kisen Hōshi]], 1 poem
*[[Henjō|Sōjō Henjō]], 17 poems
*[[Fun'ya no Yasuhide]], 1 poem

== Tsurayuki's Criticism ==
In his prefaces to the anthology ''Kokin wanashū'', Ki no Tsurayuki first praises two poets, [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]] and [[Yamabe no Akahito]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; from the period before the ''rokkasen'' and then praises these six poets of the generation preceding his own, but also critiques what he considers to be weaknesses in their personal styles.

His criticism in both prefaces is as follows:

''Kana preface''

::Among well-known recent poets, Archbishop Henjō masters style but is deficient in substance. It is no more satisfying to read one of his poems than to fall in love with a woman in a picture. The poetry of Ariwara Narihira tries to express too much content in too few words. It resembles a faded flower with a lingering fragrance. Fun'ya no Yasuhide's language is skillful, but his style is inappropriate to his content. His poems are like peddlers tricked out in fancy costumes. The language of the Ujiyama monk Kisen is veiled, leaving us uncertain about his meaning. Reading him is like trying to keep the autumn moon in sight when a cloud obscures it before dawn. Since not many of his poems are known, we cannot study them as a group in order to evaluate him. Ono no Komachi belongs to the same line as Sotoorihime of old. Her poetry is moving and lacking in strength. It reminds us of a beautiful woman suffering from an illness. Its weakness is probably due to her sex. The style of Ōtomo Kuronushi's poems is crude. They are like a mountain peasant resting under a flowering tree with a load of firewood on his back.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kokin Wakashū, With Tosa Nikki and Shinsen Waka|last=|first=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8047-1258-3|location=Stanford, CA|pages=7|translator-last=McCullough|translator-first=Helen Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mana preface''

::The Kazan Archbishop [Henjō] masters style, but his flowery language bears little fruit. His poems, like a picture of a beautiful woman, move our hearts without leading to anything. The poetry of the Ariwara Middle Captain [Narihira] tries to express too much content in too few words. It resembles a faded flower that retains its fragrance. Bunrin [Fun'ya no Yasuhide] deals cleverly with topics, but his style approaches vulgarity. His poems are like peddlers tricked out in fancy dress. The language of the Ujiyama monk Kisen is dazzling, but his poems do not flow smoothly. Reading him is like trying to keep the autumn moon in sight when a cloud obscures it before dawn. Ono no Komachi belongs to the same like as Sotoorihime of old. Her poetry is beautiful but weak, like an ailing woman wearing cosmetics. Ōtomo Kuronushi's poems belong to the line of Sarumaru of old. Although his poetry has a certain light, witty interest, the style is extremely crude, as though a peasant were resting in front of a flowering tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kokin Wakashū, With Tosa Nikki and Shinsen Waka|last=|first=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8047-1258-3|location=Stanford, CA|pages=257–8|translator-last=McCullough|translator-first=Helen Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are varying theories on both why Tsurayuki chose these six poets and why he chose to criticize them in this manner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Helen Craig McCullough|Helen McCullough]] claims that they were selected because they all had distinctive personal styles in a time of homogeneity, and that by aligning them in his commentary with the six major styles of [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] poetry, Tsurayuki was showing off his knowledge of those sources.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brocade by Night: 'Kokin Wakashū' and the Court Style in Japanese Classical Poetry|last=McCullough|first=Helen Craig|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-8047-1246-8|location=Stanford, CA|pages=313–4|translator-last=|translator-first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lammare also believes that Tsurayuki picked these poets to match the six Han styles, and focuses more on how Tsurayuki claimed these styles did not properly align heart (''kokoro'' 心) and words (''kotoba'' 言葉).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncovering Heian Japan: An Archaeology of Sensation and Inscription|last=Lamarre|first=Thomas|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780822380467|location=Durham, NC|pages=166–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The concept of the ''rokkasen'' had a lasting legacy on poetic scholarship both in the pre-modern and modern periods.

In 1009–1011, [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] compiled an expanded list known as the [[Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan Encyclopedia|last=Frédéric|first=Louis|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2002|isbn=0674007700|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=818}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came to supplant this list of six. This led to the creation of similar lists based on this pattern, such as the "Thirty-Six Court Lady Immortals of Poetry," and the "Thirty-Six Heian-period Immortals of Poetry."

Many Japanese scholars of the twentieth century conceptualized the history of ''waka'' poetry in the ninth century as a time when it was overshadowed by Chinese poetry in the first part of the century and then returned to prominence by the end of the century. These narratives held that this time was a transitional period between the ''waka'' anthologies ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' and ''Kokin wakashū''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nishiyama |first=Hidehito |date=March 2007 |title=Rokkasen no jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40015229403 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=46–54 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the ''waka'' poetry of this period, some scholars have referred to it as the Rokkasen Period (六歌仙時代 ''rokkasen jidai''), although there has been disagreement on when this period starts. Most of the scholars agree that it ends with the reign of [[Emperor Kōkō|Emepror Kōkō]], but disagree on whether it begins with [[Emperor Ninmyō]] or [[Emperor Montoku]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shimada |first=Ryōji |date=February 1970 |title=Rokkasen jidai |trans-title=The Rokkasen Period |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40001325603 |language=ja |journal=Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=42 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hidehito Nishiyama and Ryōji Shimada conclude that they believe Ninmyō is the better choice for the start of this periodization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Additionally, all but one of the Rokkasen, Ōtomo Kuronushi, appear in the famous collection of poetry, ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu|Hyakunin isshū]]''.

Selimovic and Kesinovic were born in Austria to Bosnian immigrants who had fled the [[Bosnian War]] in the 1990s. Selimovic and Kesinovic, who were residents of [[Vienna]], were believed to have been radicalized after reading about [[jihad]] on the Internet through their attendance of a Viennese mosque.

'''Satanaya''' ([[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] Сэтэнай {{IPA-cau|satanaːj|}}; [[Kabardian language|Kabardian ]] Сэтэней {{IPA-cau|satanaj|}}; [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] {{IPA-cau|satanaja|}}; [[Ossetic language|Ossetian]] Сатана '''Satana''') is a [[mythology|myth]]ological figure who appears in many cycles of the [[Nart sagas]] of the [[Caucasus]].

Satanaya is the mother of the Narts, a [[fertility]] figure who is also an authority over her children. She is often cast in the light of a "wise woman" or [[matriarch]], which mirrors the relative freedom of women in [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] societies generally. Satanaya can be compared to the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Demeter]], with whom she shares many traits.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In Ossetian tradition, she is the daughter of [[Uastyrdzhi]] (St. George).

The Chechen-Ingush version is somewhat different in that the counterpart of Satanaya, Sela-Sata, is primarily a goddess of [[crafts]] and women's work rather than a Nartic matriarch. However, many of her characteristics, including the story of her miraculous birth of a dead Nart mother and her involvement in the birth of chief hero Seska-Solsa ([[Sosruko]]), correspond closely to those of Satanaya in the other versions.&lt;ref&gt;Tsaroïeva, Mariel. Anciennes Croyances des Ingouches et des Tchetchenes. Pp. 195, 235. {{ISBN|2-7068-1792-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes of the Nart Saga including Satanaya==

In "Why the Sun Pauses at the Horizon at Sunset", Satanaya makes a bet that she can weave a coat in one day, and has to ask the sun for a favour, to slow down, that she may finish her task before the day is through.

In "Lady Satanaya's Blossom", Satanaya finds a beautiful flower by the river Kuban and plucks it and replants it in front of her house. The next day, she is sad to discover that it has withered. Once again she goes and plucks another of the same flower, only to see the same result the following morning. The third time she re-plants a flower in front of her house, it rains, and the flower is invigorated and continues to live on until the next day. Satanaya realizes the importance of water to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colarusso|first=John|authorlink=John Colarusso|title=The Woman of the Myths: The Satanaya Cycle|url=http://www.aheku.net/datas/users/1-satanaya_cycle.pdf|work=The Annual of the Society for the Study of Caucasia 2: 3-11., 1989|publisher=McMaster University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211025003/http://www.aheku.net/datas/users/1-satanaya_cycle.pdf|archivedate=2014-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roma, repubblica, moneta di p. satrienus, 77 ac..JPG|thumb|350px|The she-wolf on a coin of the late Roman republic (c.77 BC)]]
In the [[Founding of Rome|Roman foundation myth]], it was a '''she-wolf''' that nursed and sheltered the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] after they were abandoned in the wild by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]] of [[Alba Longa]]. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the [[Lupercal]], until they were discovered by a shepherd, [[Faustulus]]. [[Romulus]] would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of [[Rome]] since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Wiseman ''Remus'' preface pg xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy.  One legend claims that the [[Hirpini]] people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony,  they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: ''hirpus'').&lt;ref&gt; Strabo Book V Ch.12 (''Loeb'' pg.467) &lt;/ref&gt;  The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the wolf is a sacred animal.  There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the [[Lupercalia]].

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Apollo]]'s mother [[Leto]] is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Aristotle]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|title=History of Animals|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.345.xml?rskey=9mJ3UR&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=S0vjOz|doi=10.4159/DLCL.aristotle-history_animals.1965}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources==
The 3 "canonical" versions of the myth--those of [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]--all draw heavily on [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I 79&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins.  The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius.  Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding.  Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of [[Palatine Hill]].  The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water.  In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal.  Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.

Dionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further.  The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud.  The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.

After a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Greek colonists]] who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I ch.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness.  The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what.  The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land.  The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.&lt;ref&gt; Livy I pp.17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch.  After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away.  It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The three relay accounts wherein the term "lupa" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute.  Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment.  In one, the twins are fathered by [[Hercules]] after he wins a dice game.  Their mother is the unwitting "prize".  In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby [[Gabii]].&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Scan of Figurehead from Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums band 1 (1776).png|thumb|right|Figurehead from the title page of ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums''  Vol. 1 (1776) by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]].  Winckelmann was a pioneer in the study of Graeco-Roman art and [[ancient Roman art]] in particular.  He is center, with the she-wolf suckling the twins and [[Homer]] closest to him.  The [[Sphinx]] and an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan vase]] are in the background.]]

===Earliest representation===
The "Bolsena Mirror" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures.  Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features.&lt;ref&gt; Mazzoni pp173-178&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes its age.  However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340.  The famous [[Capitoline Wolf]] may be of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] or [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Old Latin]] origin.&lt;ref&gt; Tennant p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and [[radiocarbon dating]] has cast doubt on an ancient origin.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina,"[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html ''Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]'' "Rome: the phony She-Wolf wasn't born until the Middle-ages" La Republica. 17 November 2006, accessed 1 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[stele]] from [[Bologna]], dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant.  By 269 BC, the silver [[drachm|didrachm]] is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic "turning of the she-wolf's head" backward and downward at the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], the patron deity of the city, or the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]].  That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces.  She and the twins were featured on the elaborate [[Ara Pacis]], built in honor of [[Augustus]] and dedicated to [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]], the goddess of peace.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.336-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated.  They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own "Roman-ness".&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.339&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.343-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early middle ages===
The [[Franks Casket]], an ornately carved, [[Anglo-Saxon]] chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a [[Rune|Runic]] account of the lupercal.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.356 fn.148&lt;/ref&gt; Other Anglo-Saxon [[Undley bracteate|artifacts]] and coins from the same period also feature them.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.357&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Byzantine]]s continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in [[central Asia]] at sites located in modern [[Tadjikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] along with an 8th-century [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.&lt;ref&gt;Compareti p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siena She-Wolf===
The [[Siena|Sienese]] have a traditional tale that the city was founded by [[Senius and Aschius]], another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf.  They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus.  The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance.  However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.

==Lupercalia==
The [[Lupercalia]] was a very ancient festival even during Roman times.  Roman historians speculated as to its origins.  It may be associated with the god [[Lupercus]], the god of [[Pastoralism|shepherds]] and protector of flocks.  Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.

A '''spouse''' is a [[life partner]] in a [[marriage]], [[civil union]], or [[common-law marriage]]. The term is [[gender neutral]], whereas a male spouse is a [[husband]] and a female spouse is a [[wife]]. Although a spouse is a form of [[significant other]], the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.

==Legal status==
{{Further information|Coverture|Marital power}}
The legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly among the jurisdictions of the world. These regulations are usually described in [[family law]] statutes. However, in many parts of the world, where [[civil marriage]] is not that prevalent, there is instead customary marriage, which is usually regulated informally by the community. In many parts of the world, spousal rights and obligations are related to the payment of [[bride price]], [[dowry]] or [[dower]]. Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to male marital partners that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to female marital partners. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) “The Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. August 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings {{cite web |url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824032832/http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and France &lt;ref&gt;Although married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965,[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf] and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. [https://terapiadeparejaweb.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s. In various [[marriage laws]] around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of [[Iran]] states at Article 1105: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311161504/http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on jurisdiction, the refusal or inability of a spouse to perform the marital obligations may constitute a [[ground for divorce]], [[legal separation]] or [[annulment]]. The latter two options are more prevalent in countries where the dominant religion is [[Roman Catholicism]], some of which introduced divorce only recently (i.e. [[Italy]] in 1970, [[Portugal]] in 1975, [[Brazil]] in 1977,  [[Spain]] in 1981, [[Argentina]] in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-12/news/mn-3473_1_divorce-law|title=Divorce Is Now Legal in Argentina but, So Far, Few Couples Have Taken the Break|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paraguay]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin.

In recent years, many Western countries have adopted [[no fault divorce]]. In some parts of the world, the formal dissolution of a marriage is complicated by the payments and goods which have been exchanged between families (this is common where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]]). This often makes it difficult to leave a marriage, especially for the woman: in some parts of Africa, once the bride price has been paid, the wife is seen as belonging to the husband and his family; and if she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf |title=Protecting the Girl Child: Using the Law to End Child, Early and Forced Marriage and Related Human Rights Violations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-29 |website=equalitynow.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}

Regardless of legislation, personal relations between spouses may also be influenced by local [[culture]] and [[religion]], which may promote male authority over the wife: for instance the word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with ''owner'' and ''master''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimum age==
There is often a minimum legal [[marriageable age]]. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/MarryingTooYoung.pdf |title=Marrying Too Young - End Child Marriage |author=United Nations Population Fund UNFPA |date=2012 |website=www.unfpa.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In 2010, 158 countries reported that 18 years was the minimum legal age for marriage for women without parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority. However, in 146 countries, state or customary law allows girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of parents or other authorities; in 52 countries, girls under age 15 can marry with parental consent. In contrast, 18 is the legal age for marriage without consent among males in 180 countries. Additionally, in 105 countries, boys can marry with the consent of a parent or a pertinent authority, and in 23 countries, boys under age 15 can marry with parental consent."

==Procreation==
[[File:Kustodiev Merchants Wife.jpg|thumb|180px|''The Merchant's Wife'' (1918) by [[Boris Kustodiev]]. A wife is a spouse.]]
Although in Western countries spouses sometimes [[Childfree|choose not to have children]], such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world.  In some cultures and religions, the quality of a spouse imposes an obligation to have children. In [[northern Ghana]], for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choosing a spouse==
There are many ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include [[love marriage]], [[arranged marriage]], and [[forced marriage]]. The latter is in some jurisdictions a [[void marriage]] or a [[voidable marriage]]. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/part/10/enacted|title=Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bad guy riff.png|thumb|Theme from ''[[Mysterioso Pizzicato]]'', a [[cliché]] silent movie cue for villainy {{audio|Mysterioso Pizzicato.mid|Play}}]]

A '''villain''' (also known as, "'''baddie'''", "'''bad guy'''", "'''evil guy'''", "'''heavy'''" or "'''black hat'''") is an "[[evil]]" character in a story, whether a [[history|historical]] narrative or, especially, a work of [[fiction]]. 

The villain is a [[antagonist]] (though can be the [[protagonist]]){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} who tends to have a negative effect on other characters. A female villain is occasionally called a '''villainess'''. Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines villain as "a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel; or a character in a play, novel, or the like, who constitutes an important evil agency in the plot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/villain |website=[[Dictionary.com]] |publisher=[[Wayback Machine]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402110610/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/villain |archivedate=2014-04-02 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Image:Villains before going to Work receiving their Lord's Orders Miniature in the Proprietaire des Choses Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Library of the Arsenal in Paris.png|thumb|French villeins in the 15th century before going to work, receiving their Lord's Orders.]]

Villain comes from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] and [[Old French]] ''vilain'', which itself descends from the [[Late Latin]] word '' villanus'', meaning "farmhand",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert K. Barnhart |author2=Sol Steinmetz |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |date=1999 |publisher=Chambers |location=New York |isbn=0550142304 |page=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of someone who is bound to the soil of a ''villa'', which is to say, worked on the equivalent of a [[plantation]] in [[Late Antiquity]], in Italy or [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David B. Guralnik |title=[[Webster's New World Dictionary]] |date=1984 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0671418149 |edition=2nd college}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2018}} The same etymology produced [[villein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/villain |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a person of less than knightly status and so came to mean a person who was not [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] and [[Politeness|polite]]. As a result of many unchivalrous and evil acts, such as [[betrayal|treachery]] or rape, being considered villainous in the modern sense of the word, it became used as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[C. S. Lewis]] |title=Studies in Words |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107688650 |pages=120-121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xONwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic word "[[churl]]", originally meaning "a non-servile peasant" and denoting the lowest rank of freemen in Saxon society, had gone through a similar degradation, as did the word "[[wikt:boor#Noun|boor]]" which originally meant "farmer".

==Folk and fairy tales==
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of Russian fairy tales, concluded that a [[fairy tale]] had only eight ''[[dramatis personae]]'', of which one was the villain,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Vladimir Propp |authorlink1=Vladimir Propp |title=Morphology of the Folk Tale |date=1968 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0292783760 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions that fell into a villain's sphere were:
* a story-initiating villainy, where the villain caused harm to the hero or his family 
* a conflict between the hero and the villain, either a fight or other competition
* pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain

None of these acts necessarily occurs in a fairy tale, but when any of them do, the character that performs the act is the villain. The villain, therefore, could appear twice: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

When a character performed only these acts, the character was a pure villain. Various villains also perform other functions in a fairy tale; a witch who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of "guidance" and thus acting as a helper.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

The functions could also be spread out among several characters. If a dragon acted as the villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon's sisters) might take on the role of the villain and pursue the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

Two other characters could appear in roles that are villainous in the more general sense. One is the [[false hero]]: this character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Among these characters are [[Cinderella]]'s stepsisters, chopping off parts of their feet to fit on the shoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Tatar |authorlink1=Maria Tatar |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm |date=2004 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W.W. Norton]] |isbn=0393058484 |page=136 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another character, the dispatcher, sends a hero on his quest. This might be an innocent request, to fulfill a legitimate need, but the dispatcher might also, villainously, lie to send a character on a quest in hopes of being rid of him.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Villainous foil==
[[File:Wicked Witch of the West W.W. Denslow.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is an example of a literary villain.]]

In fiction, villains commonly function in the dual role of adversary and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the story's heroes. In their role as an adversary, the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome. In their role as a foil, the villain exemplifies characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero, creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Others point out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish-fulfillment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Das |first1=Sisir Kumar |title=A History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] |isbn=9788172017989 |page=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&amp;pg=PA416 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes some people identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes. Because of this, a convincing villain must be given a [[characterization]] that provides a [[Base motive|motive]] for doing wrong, as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero. As put by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Roger Ebert |authorlink1=Roger Ebert |title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Movie Review (1982) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan-1982 |website=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en |date=January 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Portraying and employing villains in fiction==
[[Tod Slaughter]] always portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner, with mustache-twirling, eye-rolling, leering, [[evil laughter|cackling]], and [[hand-rubbing]] (however, this often failed to translate well from stage to screen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bryan Senn |title=Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939 |date=1996 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786401758 |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffery Richards |title=The Unknown 1930s: An Alternative History of the British Cinema, 1929-39 |date=2001 |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] |isbn=9781860646287 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brad Warner]] states that "only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Brad Warner]] |title=Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye |date=2007 |publisher=New World Library |isbn=9781577315599 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Bova]] recommends to authors that their works not contain villains. He states, in his ''Tips for writers'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the real world there are no villains. No one actually sets out to do evil... Fiction mirrors life. Or, more accurately, fiction serves as a lens to focus on what they know in life and bring its realities into sharper, clearer understanding for us. There are no villains cackling and rubbing their hands in glee as they contemplate their evil deeds. There are only people with problems, struggling to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Ben Bova]] |title=Tips for writers |url=http://benbova.com/tips2.html |website=Ben Bova |accessdate=2008-12-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821135403/http://benbova.com/tips2.html |archivedate=2009-08-21 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[David Lubar]] adds: &lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a brilliant observation that has served me well in all my writing. (The bad guy isn't doing bad stuff so he can rub his hands together and snarl.) He may be driven by greed, neuroses, or the conviction that his cause is just, but he's driven by something, not unlike the things that drive a hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Darcy Pattinson |title=Villains Don't Always Wear Black |url=http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |website=Fiction Notes |accessdate=2018-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122183445/http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |archivedate=2009-01-22 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=October 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sympathetic villain===
In an attempt to add realism to their stories, many writers will try to create "sympathetic" villains, the [[antithesis]] to an [[antihero]] called an '''anti-villain'''. These villains come in just as many shapes and sizes as anti-heroes do. Some may wish to make the world a better place but go to antagonistic lengths to do so (such as [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', who commits various crimes in an attempt to complete his goal of creating a cheap, renewable source of energy, and Dr. Horrible in ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]'', who wants to rule the world so that he can solve all of its problems), or may employ a code of honor in fighting his enemies, even if it is to achieve antagonistic goals (examples include Murdock, a secondary villain in the game ''[[Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi]]'', who is honorable, but fights the player's army due to loyalty to his country). Other sympathetic villains may be pushed to antagonistic lifestyles by society's mistreatment of him due to prejudice against something he is a part of (such as [[racism]], as is the case in ''[[American History X]]''), but goes to absurd lengths to achieve the equality he desires, like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the ''[[X-Men]]'' comics and films. Others may include those manipulated by malevolent and opprobrious forces (such as [[Jack Torrance]] being manipulated by the Overlook Hotel in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''). Plot based video games tend to have two villains where one is sympathetic. This creates a foreseeable plot twist wherein either they die or they switch sides.

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

'''Winamac''' was the name of a number of [[Potawatomi]] leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was soon transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]]. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.

The Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the [[Fox Wars]] in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the [[War of 1812]]. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.

== Wilamet ==
In 1681, a group of Native Americans from several [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[New England]] accompanied French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] on an expedition to the west.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"&gt;Clifton, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilamet was adopted by the [[Potawatomi]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sleeper-Smith, ''Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001), 175n35.&lt;/ref&gt; and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was eventually transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"/&gt; Before long, he was recognized by the French as the "chief" of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"&gt;Clifton, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or ''okama''&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was instead a "chief" appointed by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the [[Franco-Indian alliance]]. According to historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], "as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief".&lt;ref&gt;White, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering [[Iroquois]] influence in the Lake Michigan region.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"/&gt; In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Cadillac]] against the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, Wilamet and [[Onanghisse]] (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief,&lt;ref&gt;White, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Potawatomis at the great [[Treaty of Montreal]], which ended the war with the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fox Wars]] (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"&gt;Clifton, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe.&lt;ref&gt;White, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"/&gt; The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 89; Edmunds, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[War of 1812]] era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"&gt;Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt; American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the "anti-American" or "hostile" Winamek and the "pro-American" or "friendly" Winamek.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 528; Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-American Winamac===
The "anti-American" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the [[Osage people|Osages]], Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor [[Ninian Edwards]] demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief [[Chief Gomo|Gomo]] informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to [[Prophetstown (village)|Prophetstown]] in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the [[Tenskwatawa|Shawnee Prophet]] and his brother [[Tecumseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with chiefs [[Shabbona]] and [[Waubonsie]], Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] at Prophetstown in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winamac began the organization for the 1812 [[siege of Fort Wayne]]. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio.  What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce.  Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort.  Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander.  Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.

After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent [[Matthew Elliott (loyalist)|Matthew Elliott]]. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan ([[Spemica Lawba]]), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-American Winamac===
The "pro-American" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash.  Beginning in 1807 he and [[Five Medals]] and [[Topinabee (I)|Topinabee]] continued to ask the American government for agricultural help.  The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people.  In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land.  A council was called at [[Fort Wayne]] in September.  Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession.  When {{convert|3|e6acre|km2}} were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi.  Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands.  The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio.  Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing.  Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown.  Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison.  Here, [[Tecumseh]] denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.&lt;ref name=McPherson&gt;'''Indian Names in Indiana''' by Alan McPherson, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois.  To end the destruction, councils where held at [[Cahokia]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the [[Shawnee]] spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors.  When [[William Henry Harrison|Gov. Harrison]] marched north to [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] on the [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] in November 1811, Winamac marched with him.  When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet.  Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by.  On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day.  When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops.  The Potawatomi were led by [[Shabbona]] with [[Waubonsie|Waubansee]] and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi).  The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages.  The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements.  Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements.  His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt;

When the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements.  He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived.  On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan.  Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt; [[Fort Dearborn]] fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.

In September 1817, Winamac and [[Metea]] represented the eastern Potawatomis at the [[treaty of Fort Meigs]], in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Winamac died in 1821.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"/&gt;
