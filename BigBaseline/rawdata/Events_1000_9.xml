'''Aarhus Symposium''' is an annual leadership conference taking place at the [[Aarhus University|University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], on the first Friday in November. The aim of the event is to connect leaders of today with leaders of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; To do so, a wide range of key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and engage in discussions with students from various universities. Hereby, the symposium allows students to relate their academic insights to the broader business society.&lt;ref&gt;http://studerende.au.dk/nyheder-og-arrangementer/nyhedsarkiv/nyhed/artikel/danske-topledere-ruster-au-studerende-til-barsk-virkelighed/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium was founded in 2011 and has since expanded its concept to also involve [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Focus|Aarhus Symposium Focus]]&lt;ref name="Faglig"&gt;http://www.netvaerksportalen.dk/artikler/studerende-og-topledere-moedes-i-faglig-debat-aarhus-symposium&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Challenge|Aarhus Symposium Challenge]].&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97854/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium is a non-profit organisation, and all symposia are organised by voluntary students together with a pro-bono board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/erhverv/ECE7183981/Leder-event-udsolgt-p%C3%A5-90-sekunder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/become-a-partner/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Four students at [[Aarhus University]] established Aarhus Symposium in 2011: David Scherer, Jens Riis Andersen, Kasper Vinther Olesen, and Andreas Emmertsen. They gathered support from other students to organise the very first Aarhus Symposium with the objective of building a bridge between students, i.e. the future leaders, and leaders in today’s businesses and society.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/12/3184822/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stiften.dk/aarhus/Erhvervslivets-tunge-drenge-yder-studiehjaelp/artikel/92572&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual Aarhus Symposium welcomed renowned speakers from the business society such as Carsten Bjerg (then CEO of [[Grundfos]]), Lars Rohde (then CEO of [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension|ATP]]), and Maria Rønn (CEO of [[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]]).&lt;ref name="Growth"&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/past-symposia/growth-in-distressed-economies/&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, the programme has extended to include prominent speakers such as [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;http://kongehuset.dk/menu/nyheder/abning-af-aarhus-symposium-2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lars Rebien Sørensen (president and CEO of [[Novo Nordisk]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE8162162/Studerende-har-hyret-verdens-bedste-chef/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jyskebank.tv/nutidens-og-fremtidens-ledere-modes-til-aarhus&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium has grown through the years as a result of wide support from students, speakers, partners, and others.&lt;ref name="Faglig"/&gt; In 2012, the Organising Committee introduced Battle of the Economists; an event to take place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. It provided a national focus to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/63904/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The event was renamed Aarhus Symposium Focus in 2016 to broaden the possibilities for topics that exceed economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/aarhussymposium/docs/booklet2016_final_rgb&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Aarhus Symposium Challenge was established to strengthen the connection between students and the leaders of today.&lt;ref name="Challenge"/&gt; Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition in which selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. Through their essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, and they potentially qualify for [[Aarhus Symposium#Leaders' Forum|Leaders’ Forum]]. Since its initiation in 2013, an increasing number of students have participated in Aarhus Symposium Challenge, making it the primary sign-up for Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/aarhus-symposium-challenge/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaders' Forum ===
[[File:ASForum.jpg|thumb|left|Leaders’ Forum session with Connie Hedegaard at Aarhus Symposium 2015.]]
Leaders’ Forum is an exclusive and intimate session where selected students discuss their essay contribution with the leader that put forth the respective challenge. Only the best essay contributions under each challenge topic qualifies for this informal session.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/challenge-faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, Leaders’ Forum has attracted much attention from the media inasmuch as it is unique in a Danish context and provides both the attending students and the top leaders the opportunity to learn from each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97871/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.dk/digital/jimmy-maymann-det-nytter-ikke-at-ville-holde-fremskridtet-tilbage&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boutique Week''' is a bi-annual shopping event in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami. Boutique Week was launched in October 2010 in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles with over 40 [[boutiques]] participating in each city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919143430/http://www.boutiqueweek.net/ |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the participating boutiques offers their merchandise at a discount of at least 25% off during the selected week.

==support==
Boutique Week is supported by local government in these cities as an effort to stimulate the economy and raise awareness for small local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view%3Dpage%26pageId%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023054400/http://boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view=page&amp;pageId=3 |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page%3Dhappenings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708081449/http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page=happenings |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boutique Week also raises money for [[Nancy Lublin]]'s non-profit organisation [[Dress For Success (organization)|Dress for Success]], supplying women with [[interview suit]]s and resources they need for success in today's workforce.

==Founders==
Boutique Week was founded in July 2010 by Polina Raygorodskaya and Olga Vidisheva.

[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine.]]
The '''Chronology of the Great Famine''' ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') documents a period  of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proximate cause]] was [[famine]] resulting from a potato disease commonly known as [[late blight]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, ''Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives'', Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Ireland{{spaced ndash}}where a third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for food{{spaced ndash}}was exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain the subject of historical debate.

An important and controversial point of debate, that is notable amongst Irish people, was that Irish food supplies were sufficient until it was taken away by the British the feed the British, and the landlords kept economic benefits to themselves. Some commentators and writers controversially compared this explanation to "genocide".

&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith, ''The Great Hunger'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991, p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-14-014515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, pp. xvi–ii, 2–3. {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==

===1845===

====August====
At the beginning of August, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the British Prime Minister, received news of a potato disease in the South of England. This was the first recorded evidence that the 'blight' which had ravaged the potato crop in North America in 1843-1844 had crossed the Atlantic. Cecil Woodham-Smith would write that a failure in England would be serious, but for Ireland, it would be a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39&lt;/ref&gt;

====September====
Following earlier reports of incidences of the blight in England, on 13 September 1845 &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}} pg.32 put the date at the 16th&lt;/ref&gt; potato blight was first reported in Ireland. The crops at Dublin were suddenly perishing, it was reported in the ''Gardeners' Chronicle'', asking "where will Ireland be in the event of a universal potato rot?"  The British Government were nevertheless optimistic through the next few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

====October====
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|[[Skibbereen]] 1847 by [[Cork (city)|Cork]] artist [[James Mahony]] (1810–1879), commissioned by the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]
*As soon as digging of potato crops began, devastating reports started coming in. Sir Robert Peel found the accounts 'very alarming' and writing to Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary on 13 October reminded him that there was always a tendency in Irish news to exaggerate.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.41&lt;/ref&gt; Constabulary Reports from the 15 reported great failures, Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary wrote that the truth about the potato crop, until digging was completed, could not be fully ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.42&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] was prompted to act,&lt;ref&gt;''The Course of Irish History'' (1994) edited by T.W.Moody and F.X.Martin. Page 268. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|1-85635-108-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 October he decided to summon an emergency meeting of his Cabinet for 31 October. The remedy he decided was to repeal the [[Corn Laws]].&lt;ref name="cws-p50"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.50&lt;/ref&gt; Peel then decided to set up a Scientific Commission to go to Ireland and investigate the potato blight and report on conditions.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergency Cabinet meeting met on 31 October till 1 November. The first day consisted of reading reports and memoranda from Ireland on the potato failure. Peel proposed that a relief commission be established in Ireland, and a sum of money be advanced to the Lord -Lieutenant. Differences arose when Peel pointed out that these measures required an advance of public money. The purchase of food for destitute districts would open the question of [[Corn Laws]]. Was it possible, it was asked, to vote public money for the sustenance of a people on account of "actual or apprehended scarcity" and still maintain restrictions on the free import of grain; Peel declared it was not.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.51&lt;/ref&gt; On this issue then the Cabinet split, the overwhelming majority voting against Peel.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to reach a decision, the Cabinet adjourned till 6 November.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;

The principle of the Corn Laws had been to keep the price of home-grown grain up. Duties on imported grain assured English farmers a minimum and profitable price. The burden of a higher price for bread was carried by the labouring classes, in particular factory workers and operatives. It was claimed that if the Corn Laws were repealed all those connected with the land would be ruined and the established social organisation of the country destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

According to Cecil Woodham-Smith, the rising wrath of Tories and landlords ensured "all interest in Ireland was submerged."  She writes that the Tory Mayor of Liverpool refused to call a meeting for the relief of Irish distress. She continues that the [[Mansion House Committee]] in Dublin was accused of 'deluding the public with a false alarm', and the blight itself 'was represented as the invention of agitators on the other side of the water'. The entanglement of the Irish famine with the repeal of the Corn Laws, she says, was a key misfortune for Ireland. The potato failure was eclipsed by the domestic issue of Corn Law repeal. The Irish famine, she writes, "slipped into the background."&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

====November====

*On 9–10 November&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 54&lt;/ref&gt; Peel ordered the secret purchase of £100,000 worth of [[Maize|Indian corn]] and meal from America for distribution in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.49&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 November the Scientific Commissioners reported that half the potato crop had been destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;
*On 19 November the Mansion House Committee in Dublin claimed to have "ascertained beyond the shadow of doubt that considerably more than one-third of the entire potato crop...has been already destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.43&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 20 November the Relief Commission first met.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52, Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 57&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unable to persuade his Cabinet to repeal the Corn Laws, on 5 December Peel tendered his resignation &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.37&lt;/ref&gt; to Queen Victoria but was reinstated days later when [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] was unable to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1846===
The first deaths from hunger took place in early 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keneally (1999) ''The Great Shame''. London: Vintage: 110&lt;/ref&gt; In March Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland but was forced to resign as Prime Minister on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 78–86&lt;/ref&gt; The new Whig administration under [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], influenced by their [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 408–11&lt;/ref&gt; then halted government food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without any work, money or food.&lt;ref name="david2002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 224, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Grain continued to be exported from the country.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; Private initiatives such as The Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) attempted to fill the gap caused by the end of government relief and eventually the government reinstated the relief works, although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; The blight almost totally destroyed the 1846 crop and the Famine worsened considerably.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; By December a third of a million destitute people were employed in public works.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 311&lt;/ref&gt;

===1847===

There were average crop yields in the 1847 harvest, but due to lack of seed potatoes to plant, the crop was low.&lt;ref&gt;Líam Kennedy, Paul S. Ell, E. M. Crawford &amp; L. A. Clarkson, Mapping The Great Irish Famine, Four Courts Press, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85182-353-0}} pg.69&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds began to throng the public works during the last months of 1846 and the start of 1847, which promoted exactly the social conditions for the spread of 'famine fever.'&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.173&lt;/ref&gt; In late January and February, legislation called the Temporary Relief Act went through the British parliament; it became popularly known as the Soup Kitchen Act and occasionally as Burgoyne's Act.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 136&lt;/ref&gt; This system of relief was designed to deliver cheap food directly and gratuitously to the destitute masses. This system of relief would be terminated in September.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg. 81–85&lt;/ref&gt; The government also announced an additional change in the system of relief. After August 1847, the permanent Poor Law was to be extended and was to become responsible for providing relief and as a result, all relief would be financed by the local Poor Law rates.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; This put impossible loads on local poor rates, particularly in the rural west and south.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 174–187&lt;/ref&gt; With the mass emigration of the famine era, the horrors of the '[[coffin ships]]' and 1847 have ever since been associated in the popular mind, according to James S. Donnelly.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.179&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1847 The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847]] was enacted due to growing Irish nationalist agitation that was causing the British government concern about a possible [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|violent rebellion]] against British rule in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, Cecil [[The Great Hunger]] Ireland1845 1849 Harper and Row   New york pages 326-327&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill gave the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] the power to organise the island into districts and bring police forces into them at the districts' expense. It limited who could own guns, and required all of the men in the district between the ages of 16 and 60 to assist in apprehending suspected murderers when landlords were killed, or else be guilty of a misdemeanour themselves.

===1848===
The blight returned in 1848 and outbreaks of cholera were reported.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Evictions became common among the Irish who could not keep up with the demands of their British landlords. Famine victims on outdoor relief peaked in July at almost 840,000 people.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; On 29 July [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|an uprising against the government]] was led by [[William Smith O'Brien]]. After a skirmish at "[[Famine Warhouse 1848|Widow McCormack's house]]" in the village of [[Ballingarry, South Tipperary|Ballingarry]], [[County Tipperary]] the leaders of the rebellion fled to America or were sentenced to transportation.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kee (2000) ''The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism'': 270-89&lt;/ref&gt;

===1849===
The potato crop failed again in 1849 and famine was accompanied by cholera outbreaks.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; This deadly cholera epidemic killed one of Ireland's greatest poets: [[James Clarence Mangan]].&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;

===1850===
The Famine ended.&lt;ref name="david20022002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 313&lt;/ref&gt;

===1851===
By 1851 census figures showed that the population of Ireland had fallen to 6,575,000 – a drop of 1,600,000 in ten years.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Cormac Ó Gráda and Joel Mokyr have described the 1851 census as a famous but flawed source. They contend that the combination of institutional and individuals figures gives "an incomplete and biased count" of fatalities during the famine.&lt;ref name="cormac2006"&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland’s Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, University College Dublin Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The famine left in its wake up to a million dead and another million emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 226&lt;/ref&gt; The famine caused a sense of lasting bitterness by the Irish towards the British government, whom many blamed — then and now — for the starvation of so many people.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; The fall-out of the famine continued for decades afterwards.

The '''chronology of the universe''' describes the history and [[future of the universe]] according to [[Big Bang]] cosmology.

==Outline== 
For the purposes of this summary, it is convenient to divide the chronology of the universe since it [[Cosmogony|originated]], into five parts. It is generally considered meaningless or unclear whether [[time]] existed before this chronology:&lt;!--merely based on the de facto article toc, not binding in any way and can be rearranged along with article structure--&gt;

:'''1. The [[#Very early universe|very early universe]]''' – the first [[picosecond]]&amp;nbsp;(10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of cosmic time. It includes the [[Planck epoch]], during which currently understood [[laws of physics]] may not apply; the emergence in stages of the four known [[fundamental interaction]]s or [[force]]s – first [[gravity]], and later the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] interactions; and the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] and [[supercooling]] of the  still immensely hot universe due to [[cosmic inflation]], which is believed to have been triggered by the separation of the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]].

:Tiny ripples in the universe at this stage are believed to be the basis of large-scale structures that formed much later. Different stages of the very early universe are understood to different extents.  The earlier parts are beyond the grasp of practical experiments in [[particle physics]] but can be explored through other means.

:'''2. The [[#Early universe|early universe]]''', lasting around 377,000 years. Initially, various kinds of [[subatomic particle]]s are formed in stages. These particles include almost equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], so most of it quickly annihilates, leaving a small excess of matter in the universe.

:At about one second,  [[Neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decouple]]; these neutrinos form the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. If [[primordial black hole]]s exist, they are also  formed at about one second of cosmic time.  [[Composite particle|Composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s emerge – including [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – and from about 3 minutes, conditions are suitable for [[nucleosynthesis]]: around 25% of the protons and all the neutrons  [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[big bang nucleosynthesis|into heavier elements]], mainly [[helium-4]].

:By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for fusion, but far too hot for neutral [[atom]]s to exist or [[photon]]s to travel far. It is therefore an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. At around 47,000 years,&lt;ref name="ryden"&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41&lt;/ref&gt; as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by [[matter]] rather than radiation.

:At about 377,000 years {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral [[atom]]s to form ("[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]"), and as a result it also became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] for the first time. The newly formed atoms – mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with traces of [[lithium]] – quickly reach their lowest energy state ([[ground state]]) by releasing photons ("[[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]"), and these photons can still be detected today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). This is currently the oldest observation we have of the universe.

:'''3. Dark Ages and large-scale [[structure formation|structure emergence]]''', from 377,000 years until about 1 billion years. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent but the clouds of [[hydrogen]] only collapsed very slowly to form [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], so there were no new sources of light. The only photons (electromagnetic radiation, or "light") in the universe were those released during decoupling (visible today as the [[cosmic microwave background]]) and [[hydrogen line|21 cm radio emissions]] occasionally emitted by hydrogen atoms. The decoupled photons would have filled the universe with a brilliant pale orange glow at first, gradually [[redshift]]ing to non-visible [[wavelength]]s after about 3 million years, leaving it without visible light. This period is known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]].

:Between about 10 and 17 million years the universe's average temperature was suitable for liquid water (273 – 373K) and there has been speculation whether rocky planets or indeed life could have arisen briefly, since statistically a tiny part of the universe could have had different conditions from the rest, and gained warmth from the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October" /&gt;

:At some point around 400 to 700 million years, the earliest generations of [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies form]], and early large structures gradually emerge, drawn to the foam-like  [[dark matter]] [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] which have already begun to draw together throughout the universe. [[Population III star|The earliest generations of stars]] have not yet been observed astronomically. They may have been huge and [[metallicity|non-metallic]] with very short lifetimes compared to [[Main Sequence|most stars we see today]], so they commonly finish burning their [[hydrogen]] fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years. Other theories suggest that they may have included small stars, some perhaps still burning today. In either case, these early generations of supernovae created most of the everyday [[chemical element|elements]] we see around us today, and seeded the universe with them.

:[[Galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s emerge over time. At some point, high energy photons from the earliest stars, [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and perhaps [[quasar]]s led to a period of [[reionization]]. The universe gradually transitioned into the universe we see around us today, and the Dark Ages only fully came to an end at about 1 billion years.

:'''4. The universe as it appears today'''. From 1 billion years, and for about 12.8 billions of years, the universe has looked much as it does today. It will continue to appear very similar for many billions of years into the future. The [[thin disk]] of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] began to form at about 5 billion years (8.8 bn years ago),&lt;ref name=Peloso&gt;{{cite journal |last1=del Peloso |first1=E. F. |last2=da Silva |first2=L. |last3=Porto de Mello |first3=G. F. |last4=Arany-Prado |first4=L. I. |title=The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eunucleocosmochronology. III.

:From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the slowing expansion of space gradually begins to accelerate under the influence of [[dark energy]], which may be a [[scalar field]] throughout our universe. The present-day universe is understood quite well, but beyond about 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years in the future), uncertainties in current knowledge mean that we are less sure which path our universe will take.

:'''5. [[Fate of the universe|The far future]]'''. At some time the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.

Earliest stages of chronology shown below (before neutrino decoupling) are an active area of research and based on ideas which are still speculative and subject to modification as scientific knowledge improves.

"Time" column is based on extrapolation of observed [[metric expansion of space]] back in the past. For the earliest stages of chronology this extrapolation may be invalid. To give one example, [[eternal inflation]] theories propose that inflation lasts forever throughout most of the universe, making the notion of "N seconds since Big Bang" ill-defined.

The radiation temperature refers to the [[cosmic background radiation]] and is given by 2.725·(1+''z''), where ''z'' is the [[redshift]].

==Very early universe {{anchor|Very early universe}}==

===Planck epoch===
:''Times shorter than 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ([[Planck time]])''
{{Main|Planck epoch}}

The [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]] immediately after the event which began our known universe. During this epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so inconceivably high compared to any temperature we can observe today, that everyday subatomic particles could not form, and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe—[[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction|weak nuclear interaction]], and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]]—were combined and formed one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a [[gravitational singularity]] before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of [[general relativity]], which is thought to break down for this epoch due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].

In inflationary models of cosmology, times before the end of inflation (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang) do not follow the same timeline as in traditional big bang cosmology. Models that aim to describe the universe and physics during the Planck epoch are generally speculative and fall under the umbrella of "[[New Physics]]". Examples include the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]],  [[string gas cosmology]], and the [[ekpyrotic universe]].

===Grand unification epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", p. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Grand unification epoch}}

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separated from each other. These [[phase transition]]s can be visualised as similar to [[condensation]] and [[freezing]] phase transitions of ordinary matter. At certain temperatures/energies, water molecules change their behaviour and structure, and they will behave completely differently. Like steam turning to water, the [[field (physics)|fields]] which define our universe's fundamental forces and particles also completely change their behaviors and structures when the temperature/energy falls below a certain point. This is not apparent in everyday life, because it only happens at much, much, higher temperatures than we usually see in our present universe.

These phase transitions are believed to be caused by a phenomenon of [[quantum field]]s called "[[symmetry breaking]]".

In everyday terms, as the universe cools, it becomes possible for the quantum fields that create the forces and particles around us, to settle at lower energy levels and with higher levels of stability. In doing so, they completely shift how they interact. Forces and interactions arise due to these fields, so the universe can behave very differently above and below a phase transition. For example, in a later epoch, a side effect of one phase transition is that suddenly, many particles that had no mass at all acquire a mass (they begin to interact with the [[Higgs boson]]), and a single  force begins to manifest as two separate forces.

The grand unification epoch began with a phase transitions of this kind, when gravitation separated from the universal combined [[gauge theory|gauge force]]. This caused two forces to now exist: gravity, and an  [[electrostrong interaction]]. There is no hard evidence yet, that such a combined force existed, but many physicists believe it did. The physics of this electrostrong interaction would be described by a so-called [[grand unified theory]] (GUT).

The grand unification epoch ended with a second phase transition, as the electrostrong interaction in turn separated, and began to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak force|electroweak]] interactions.

===Electroweak epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds (or the end of inflation) and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
{{Main|Electroweak epoch}}

Depending on how epochs are defined, and the model being followed, the [[electroweak epoch]] may be considered to start before or after the inflationary epoch. In some models it is described as including the inflationary epoch. In other models, the electroweak epoch is said to begin after the inflationary epoch ended, at roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

According to traditional big bang cosmology, the electroweak epoch began 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the universe was low enough (10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; K) for the [[Grand Unified Theory|Electronuclear Force]] to begin to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong interaction|strong]] and the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] interactions. (The electroweak interaction will also separate later, dividing into the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions). The exact point where electrostrong symmetry was broken is not certain, because of the very high energies of this event.

===Inflationary epoch and the rapid expansion of space===
:''Before ca.  10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Inflationary epoch|Expansion of space}}
At this point, the very early universe [[expansion of space|suddenly and very rapidly expanded]] to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; times its previous volume (and possibly much more). This is equivalent to a linear increase of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; times in every spatial dimension – equivalent to an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length, expanding to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long in a tiny fraction of a second. This change is known as [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].

Although light and objects within [[spacetime]] cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], in this case it was the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changed in scale. Changes to the metric are not limited by the speed of light.

In some models, it is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition|separation]] of the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]]s which ended the [[grand unification epoch]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated an enormous repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space itself. Inflation explains several observed properties of the current universe that are otherwise difficult to account for, including explaining how today's universe has ended up so exceedingly [[homogeneous]] (similar) on a very large scale, even though it was highly disordered in its earliest stages.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang.  The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflation field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, as the inflaton field decayed into other particles, known as "reheating". This heating effect led to the universe being repopulated with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]]. In other models, reheating is often considered to mark the start of the [[electroweak epoch]], and some  theories, such as [[warm inflation]], avoid a reheating phase entirely.

In non-traditional versions of Big Bang theory  (known as "inflationary" models), inflation ended at a temperature corresponding to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang, but this does ''not'' imply that the inflationary era lasted less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. To explain the observed homogeneity of the universe, the duration in these models must be longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. Therefore, in inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the ''end'' of inflation. 

After inflation ended, the universe continued to expand, but at a very slow rate. The slow expansion began to speed up after several billion years, believed to be due to [[dark energy]], and is still expanding today.

On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]] which was interpreted as clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317B"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865|work=BICEP2 News|title=Not Even Wrong|date=13 May 2014|first=Peter|last=Woit|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported &lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.

===Electroweak symmetry breaking ===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Electroweak symmetry breaking}}

As the universe's temperature continued to fall below a certain very high energy level, a third [[symmetry breaking]] occurs. So far as we currently know, it was the final symmetry breaking event in the formation of our universe. It is believed that below some energies unknown yet&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Electroweak interaction ]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]]. THANK YOU. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] &lt;math&gt;v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Higgs field]] (where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]), it's not the symmetry breaking energy scale.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2018}} the [[Higgs field]] spontaneously acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]. When this happens, it [[electroweak symmetry breaking|breaks electroweak gauge symmetry]]. This has two related effects:

# Via the [[Higgs mechanism]], all [[elementary particle]]s interacting with the Higgs field become massive, having been massless at higher energy levels.
# As a side-effect, the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]], and their respective [[boson]]s (the [[W and Z bosons]] and [[photon]]) now begin to manifest differently in the present universe. Before electroweak symmetry breaking these bosons were all massless particles and interacted over long distances, but at this point the W and Z bosons abruptly become massive particles only interacting over distances smaller than the size of an atom, while the photon remains massless and remains a long-distance interaction.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the [[fundamental interactions]] we know of – [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] – have all taken their present forms, and fundamental particles have mass, but the temperature of the universe is still too high to allow the formation of many fundamental particles we now see in the universe.

===Supersymmetry breaking (speculative)===
{{Main|Supersymmetry breaking}}

If [[supersymmetry]] is a property of our universe, then it must be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 [[TeV]], the electroweak scale. The masses of particles and their [[superpartner]]s would then no longer be equal.  This very high energy could explain why no superpartners of known particles have ever been observed.

==Early universe{{anchor|Early universe}}==

After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], the remains of reheating. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is much better understood, and the energies involved in the [[Quark epoch]] are directly amenable to [[particle physics|experiment]].

===The quark epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Quark epoch}}

The [[quark epoch]] began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]]. This was the period in the evolution of the early universe immediately after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s.

During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[lepton]]s and their [[antiparticle]]s. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s.

The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons.

====Baryogenesis====
{{Main|Baryogenesis}}
{{further|Leptogenesis (physics)}}
''Perhaps by 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baryon]]s are [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, that are composed of three [[quark]]s. It would be expected that both baryons, and particles known as [[antimatter|antibaryons]] would have formed in equal numbers. However, this does not seem to be what happened – as far as we know, the universe was left with far more baryons than antibaryons. In fact, almost no antibaryons are observed in nature. It is not clear how this came about. Any explanation for this phenomenon must allow the [[Sakharov conditions]] related to baryogenesis to have been satisfied at some time after the end of [[cosmological inflation]]. Current [[particle physics]] suggests asymmetries under which these conditions would be met, but these asymmetries appear to be too small to account for the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

===Hadron epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; second and 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Hadron epoch}}

The quark–gluon plasma that composes the universe cools until [[hadron]]s, including baryons such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, can form.
Initially, hadron/anti-hadron pairs could form, so [[matter]] and [[anti-matter]] were in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, new hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced, and most of the newly formed hadrons and anti-hadrons [[annihilation|annihilated]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high-energy [[photon]]s. A comparatively small residue of hadrons remained at about 1 second of cosmic time, when this epoch ended. 

Theory predicts that about 1 neutron remained for every 7 protons. We believe this to be correct because, at a later stage, all the neutrons and some of the protons [[nuclear fusion|fused]], leaving [[hydrogen]], a hydrogen [[isotope]] called [[deuterium]], [[helium]] and other elements, which we can measure. A 1:7 ratio of hadrons at the end of this epoch would indeed produce the observed element ratios in the early as well as current universe.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Neutrino decoupling and cosmic neutrino background===

{{main|Neutrino decoupling|Cosmic neutrino background}}

At approximately 1 second after the Big Bang [[neutrino]]s [[neutrino decoupling|decouple]] and begin traveling freely through space. As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later [[cosmic microwave background]] emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] – ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: {{cite journal |last1=Follin |first1=Brent |last2=Knox |first2=Lloyd |last3=Millea |first3=Marius |last4=Pan |first4=Zhen |title=First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=26 August 2015 |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301|pmid=26371637 |arxiv=1503.07863 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115i1301F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so this [[cosmic neutrino background]] (CNB) may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillations|baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover, the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

=== Possible formation of primordial black holes===
: ''May have occurred within about 1 second after the Big Bang''
[[Primordial black hole]]s are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zel'dovitch &amp; Novikov|title=The Hypothesis of Cores Retarded During Expansion and the Hot Cosmological Model|journal=Astronomicheskii Zhurnal|date=14 March 1966|volume=10|issue=4|pages=602–603|bibcode=1966AZh....43..758Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may have formed during the so-called ''radiation dominated era'', due to the high densities and inhomogeneous conditions within the first second of cosmic time. Random fluctuations could lead to some regions becoming dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Current understandings and theories place tight limits on the abundance and mass of these objects.

Typically, primordial black hole formation requires density contrasts (regional variations in the Universe's density) of around &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10%), where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms could produce dense regions meeting this criterion during the early universe, including reheating, cosmological phase transitions and (in so-called "hybrid inflation models") axion inflation. Since primordial black holes didn't form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (~2×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g). [[Stephen Hawking]] calculated in 1971 that primordial black holes could weigh as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} But they can have any size, so they could also be large, and may have contributed to the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

===Lepton epoch===
:''Between 1 second and 10 seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Lepton epoch}}

The majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate each other at the end of the hadron epoch, leaving [[lepton]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[muon]]s and certain [[neutrino]]s) and anti-leptons, dominating the mass of the universe. 

The lepton epoch follows a similar path to the earlier hadron epoch. Initially leptons and anti-leptons are produced in pairs. About 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe falls to the point at which new lepton/anti-lepton pairs are no longer created and most remaining leptons and anti-leptons quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high energy photons, and leaving a small residue of non-annihilated leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|title=The Timescale of Creation|website=Knowledge tree project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|archivedate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon epoch===
:''Between 10 seconds and 377,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Photon epoch}}

After most leptons and anti-leptons are annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, most of the mass-energy in the universe is left in the form of [[photon]]s. (Much of the rest of its mass-energy is in the form of [[neutrino]]s and other [[special relativity|relativistic]] particles{{cn|date=September 2018}}). Therefore the energy of the universe, and its overall behavior, is dominated by its [[photon]]s. These photons continue to interact frequently with charged protons, electrons and (eventually) [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. They continue to do so for about the next 377,000 years.

===Nucleosynthesis of light elements===
:''Between 2 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|title=Detailed timeline of Big Bang nucleosynthesis processes|first=Edward L.|last=Wright|date=26 September 2012|website=astro.ucla.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}

Between about 2 and 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and pressure of the universe allow [[nuclear fusion]] to occur, giving rise to nuclei of a few light [[chemical element|elements]] beyond hydrogen ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]"). About 25% of the protons, and all&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; the neutrons fuse to form [[deuterium]], a hydrogen [[isotope]], and most of the deuterium quickly fuses to form [[helium-4]]. 

Atomic nuclei will easily unbind (break apart) above a certain temperature, related to their [[binding energy]]. From about 2 minutes, the falling temperature means that deuterium no longer unbinds, and is stable,  and starting from about 3 minutes, helium and other elements formed by the fusion of deuterium  also no longer unbind and are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_10/notes44.html|first=Barbara|last=Ryden|date=12 March 2003|title=Astronomy 162 — Lecture 44: The first three minutes|website=astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short duration and falling temperature means that only the simplest and fastest fusion processes can occur. Only tiny amounts of nuclei beyond helium are formed, because [[nucleosynthesis]] of heavier elements is difficult and [[triple-alpha process|requires thousands of years]] even in stars.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HP/article/download/5186/4314|title=The foreground of big bang nucleosynthesis|first=Ravi|last=Karki|journal=The Himalayan Phisics|volume=1|issue=1|date=May 2010|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of [[tritium]] (another hydrogen isotope) and [[beryllium]]-7 and -8 are formed, but these are unstable and are quickly lost again.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; A small amount of deuterium is left unfused because of the very short duration.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"/&gt;

Therefore, the only stable nuclides created by the end of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] are protium (single proton/hydrogen nucleus), deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.4156 |title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates |journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume = 214 |issue = 1 |pages = 5 |last1=Kusakabe |first1=Motohiko |display-authors=etal |year = 2014|doi = 10.1088/0067-0049/214/1/5 |bibcode = 2014ApJS..214....5K }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mass, the resulting matter is about 75% hydrogen nuclei, 25% helium nuclei, and perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; by mass of [[Lithium-7]]. The next most common stable isotopes produced are [[lithium-6]], [[beryllium-9]], [[boron-11]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ("CNO"), but these have predicted abundances of between 5 and 30 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; by mass, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|issue = 10102|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.6694 |title = Standard big bang nucleosynthesis and primordial CNO Abundances after Planck|journal = Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume = 2014|issue = 10|pages = 050|doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2014/10/050|year = 2014|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|last2 = Uzan|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last3 = Vangioni|first3 = Elisabeth|bibcode = 2014JCAP...10..050C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amounts of each light element in the early universe can be estimated from old galaxies, and is strong evidence for the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; For example, the Big Bang should produce about 1 neutron for every 7 protons, allowing for 25% of all nucleons to be fused into helium-4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons out of every 16 nucleons), and this is the amount we find today, and far more than can be easily explained by other processes.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Similarly, deuterium fuses extremely easily; any alternative explanation must also explain how conditions existed for deuterium to form, but also left some of that deuterium unfused and not immediately fused again into helium.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Any alternative must also explain the proportions of the various light elements and their isotopes. A few isotopes, such as lithium-7, were found to be present in amounts that differed from theory, but over time, these differences have been resolved by better observations.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Matter domination===
:''47,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{main|Matter-dominated era}}
Until now, the universe's large scale dynamics and behavior have been determined mainly by radiation – meaning, those constituents that move [[special relativity|relativistically]] (at or near the [[speed of light]]), such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; As the universe cools, from around 47,000 years (z=3600),&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large scale behavior becomes dominated by [[matter]] instead. This occurs because the energy density of matter begins to exceed both the energy density of radiation  and the vacuum energy density.&lt;ref&gt;Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Around or shortly after this time,{{when|date=April 2018}} the densities of non-relativistic matter (atomic nuclei) and relativistic radiation (photons) become equal, the [[Jeans length]], which determines the smallest structures that can form (due to competition between gravitational attraction and pressure effects), begins to fall and perturbations, instead of being wiped out by [[free-streaming]] [[radiation]], can begin to grow in amplitude.

According to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], by this stage, the [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of [[dark energy]]). There is overwhelming evidence that [[dark matter]] exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation.

From this point on, and for several billion years to come, the presence of dark matter accelerates the [[structure formation|formation of structure]] in our universe. In the early universe, dark matter gradually gathers in huge filaments under the effects of [[gravity]]. This amplifies the tiny inhomogeneities (irregularities) in the density of the universe which was left by cosmic inflation. Over time, slightly denser regions become denser and slightly rarefied (emptier) regions become more rarefied. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter.

About 377,000 years after the Big Bang, two connected events occurred: [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Recombination describes the ionized particles combining to form the first  neutral [[atom]]s, and decoupling refers to the [[photon]]s released ("decoupled") as the newly formed atoms settle into more stable energy states.

Just before recombination, the [[baryonic matter]] in the universe was at a temperature where it formed a hot [[plasma (physics)|ionized plasma]]. Most of the photons in the universe interacted with electrons and protons, and could not travel significant distances without interacting with ionized particles. As a result, the universe was opaque or "foggy". Although there was light, it was not possible to see, nor can we observe that light through telescopes.

At around 377,000 years, the universe has cooled to a point where free [[electron]]s can combine with the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to form neutral atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results | first=G. | last=Hinshaw | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume=180 | issue=2| pages=225–245 | year=2009 | url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 | arxiv=0803.0732 | bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is relatively fast (and faster for the helium than for the hydrogen), and is known as [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V: "Physical foundations of Cosmology", p. 120, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The name is slightly inaccurate and is given for historical reasons: in fact the electrons and atomic nuclei were combining for the first time.

Directly combining in a low energy state ([[ground state]]) is less efficient, so these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons still in a high energy state, and once combined, the electrons quickly release energy in the form of one or more [[photon]]s as they transition to a low energy state. This release of photons is known as [[Decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Some of these decoupled photons are captured by other hydrogen atoms, the remainder remain free. By the end of recombination, most of the protons in the universe have formed neutral atoms. This change from charged to neutral particles means that the [[mean free path]] photons can travel before capture in effect becomes infinite, so any decoupled photons that have not been captured can travel freely over long distances (see [[Thomson scattering]]). The universe has become transparent to visible [[light]], [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] for the first time in its history.

| The background of this box approximates the original [[Color temperature|4000K color]] of the photons released during decoupling, before they became [[redshift]]ed to form the [[cosmic microwave background]].

|}
The photons released by these newly formed hydrogen atoms initially had a [[Color temperature|temperature/energy of around ~ 4000&amp;nbsp;K]]. This would have been visible to the eye as a pale yellow/orange tinted, or "soft", white color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/colour/colour-temperature.html|title=Color temperature chart|website=Media college|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over billions of years since decoupling, as the universe has expanded, the photons have been [[red-shift]]ed from visible light to radio waves (microwave radiation corresponding to a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K). Red shifting describes the photons acquiring longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency|frequencies]] as the [[metric expansion of space|universe expanded over billions of years]], so that they gradually changed from visible light to radio waves. These same photons can still be detected as radio waves today. They form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"), and they provide crucial evidence of the early universe and how it developed.

Around the same time as recombination, existing [[pressure wave]]s within the electron-baryon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] – known as [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] – became embedded in the distribution of matter as it condensed, giving rise to a very slight preference in distribution of large-scale objects. Therefore, the cosmic microwave background is a picture of the universe at the end of this epoch including the tiny fluctuations generated during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] (see diagram), and the spread of objects such as galaxies in the universe is an indication of the scale and size of the universe as it developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Quasars illustrate dark energy's roller coaster ride|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20303592|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark Ages ===
&lt;!--Note: This section is directly linked to by [[Graphical timeline from Big Bang to Heat Death]]. Update that link if changing the anchor in the section title.--&gt;
{{see also|21 centimeter radiation}}
After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent and had cooled enough to allow light to travel long distances, but there were no light-producing structures such as [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Stars and galaxies are formed when dense regions of gas form due to the action of [[gravity]], and this takes a long time within a near-uniform density of gas and on the scale required, so it is estimated that stars did not exist for perhaps hundreds of millions of years after recombination.

This period, known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]], began around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. During the Dark Ages, the temperature of the universe cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K, and only two sources of photons existed: the photons released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral hydrogen atoms formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and photons occasionally released by neutral hydrogen atoms, known as the [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line of neutral hydrogen]]. The hydrogen spin line is in the microwave range of frequencies, and within 3 million years,{{cn|date=October 2018}} the CMB photons had [[redshift]]ed out of visible light to [[infrared]]; from that time until the first stars, there were no visible light photons. Other than perhaps some rare statistical anomalies, the universe was truly dark.

The October 2010 discovery of [[UDFy-38135539]], the first observed galaxy to have existed during the following [[reionization]] epoch, gives us a window into these times. The galaxy earliest in this period observed and thus also the most distant galaxy ever observed is currently on the record of Leiden University's Richard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingsworth from UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. They found the galaxy [[UDFj-39546284]] to be at a time some 480 million years after the Big Bang or about halfway through the Cosmic Dark Ages at a distance of about 13.2 billion [[light-years]]. More recently, the [[UDFy-38135539]], [[EGSY8p7]] and [[GN-z11]] galaxies were found to be around 380–550 million years after the Big Bang and at a distance of around 13.4 billion light-years.&lt;ref name="Space-20121212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Ancient Galaxy May Be Most Distant Ever Seen|url=http://www.space.com/18879-hubble-most-distant-galaxy.html |date=December 12, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also currently an [[LOFAR|observational effort]] underway to detect the faint 21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line radiation, as it is in principle an even more powerful tool than the cosmic microwave background for studying the early universe.

Structures may have begun to emerge from around 150 million years, and stars and early galaxies gradually emerged from around 400 to 700 million years. As they emerged, the Dark Ages gradually ended. Because this process was gradual, the Dark Ages only fully ended around 1 billion (1000 million) years, as the universe took its present appearance.

====Speculative "habitable epoch"====
:''ca. 10–17 million years after the Big Bang''

For about 6.6 million years, between about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100), the background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, a temperature compatible with [[liquid water]] and common [[biological]] [[chemical reactions]]. [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|arxiv = 1312.0613 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=December 2013|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L |doi = 10.1017/S1473550414000196 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb argues that carbon-based life might have evolved in a hypothetical pocket of the early universe that was dense enough both to generate at least one massive star that subsequently releases carbon in a supernova, and that was also dense enough to generate a planet. (Such dense pockets, if they existed, would have been extremely rare.) Life would also have required a heat differential, rather than just uniform background radiation; this could be provided by naturally-occurring geothermal energy. Such life would likely have remained primitive; it is highly unlikely that intelligent life would have had sufficient time to evolve before the hypothetical oceans freeze over at the end of the habitable epoch.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |title=Life possible in the early Universe |url=https://www.nature.com/news/life-possible-in-the-early-universe-1.14341 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=Nature |date=10 December 2013 |pages=201–201 |language=en |doi=10.1038/504201a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. Since the start of the matter-dominated era, the dark matter has gradually been gathering in huge spread out (diffuse) [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] under the effects of [[gravity]]. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter. It is also slightly more dense at regular distances due to early [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) which became embedded into the distribution of matter when photons decoupled. Unlike dark matter, ordinary matter can lose energy by many routes, which means that as it collapses, it can lose the energy which would otherwise hold it apart, and collapse more quickly, and into denser forms. Ordinary matter gathers where dark matter is denser, and in those places it collapses into clouds of mainly hydrogen [[gas cloud|gas]]. The first stars and galaxies form from these clouds. Where numerous galaxies have formed, galaxy clusters and superclusters will eventually arise. Large [[void (cosmology)|voids]] with few stars will develop between them, marking where dark matter became less common.

Structure formation in the big bang model proceeds hierarchically, due to [[gravitational collapse]], with smaller structures forming before larger ones. The earliest structures to form are the first stars (known as [[population III stars]]), [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]], and [[quasar]]s (which are thought to be bright, early [[active galaxies]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]] surrounded by a inward-spiralling [[accretion disk]] of gas). Before this epoch, the evolution of the universe could be understood through linear cosmological [[perturbation theory]]: that is, all structures could be understood as small deviations from a perfect homogeneous universe. This is computationally relatively easy to study. At this point non-linear structures begin to form, and the [[computational problem]] becomes much more difficult, involving, for example, [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulation]]s with billions of particles. The [[Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation]] is a high precision simulation of this era.

These Population III stars are also responsible for turning the few light elements that were formed in the Big Bang (hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium) into many heavier elements. They can be huge as well as perhaps small – and non-[[metallicity|metallic]] (no elements except hydrogen and helium). The larger stars have very short lifetimes compared to most Main Sequence stars we see today, so they commonly finish burning their hydrogen fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years, seeding the universe with heavier elements over repeated generations. They mark the start of the [[Stelliferous era|Stelliferous (starry) era]].

As yet, no Population III stars have been found, so our understanding of them is based on [[computational model]]s of their formation and evolution.  Fortunately, observations of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] radiation can be used to date when star formation began in earnest.  Analysis of such observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck telescope in 2016 concluded that the first generation of stars formed 700 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/planck-first-stars-formed-later-than-we-thought ''Planck: First Stars Formed Later Than We Thought''; NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quasar]]s provides some additional evidence of early structure formation. Their light shows evidence of elements such as [[carbon]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[oxygen]]. This is evidence that by the time quasars formed, a massive phase of [[star formation]] had already taken place, including sufficient generations of [[population III stars]] to give rise to these elements.

=== Reionization===
{{See also|Reionization|Dwarf galaxy|Quasar}}
As the [[population III star|first stars]], [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s gradually form, the intense radiation they emit reionizes much of the surrounding universe; splitting the neutral hydrogen atoms back into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of free [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s for the first time since [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]].

Reionization is evidenced from observations of [[quasar]]s. Quasars are a form of [[active galaxy]], and the most luminous objects observed in the universe. Electrons in neutral hydrogen have a specific patterns of absorbing photons, related to electron energy levels and called the [[Lyman series]]. Ionized hydrogen does not have electron energy levels of this kind. Therefore, light travelling through ionized hydrogen and neutral hydrogen shows different absorption lines. In addition, the light will have travelled for billions of years to reach us, so any absorption by neutral hydrogen will have been redshifted by varied amounts, rather than by one specific amount, indicating when it happened. These features make it possible to study the state of ionization at many different times in the past. They show that reionization began as "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen which became larger over time.&lt;ref name="dijkstra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lyα Emitting Galaxies as a Probe of Reionization|date=5 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Dijkstra|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|doi=10.1017/pasa.2014.33|volume=31|arxiv = 1406.7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show that the absorption was due to the general state of the universe (the [[intergalactic medium]]) and not due to passing through galaxies or other dense areas.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt; Reionization might have started as early as ''z''=16 (250 million years of cosmic time) and was complete by around ''z''=9 or 10 (500 million years). The epoch of reionization probably ended by around ''z''=5 or 6 (1 billion years) as the era of Population III stars and quasars – and their intense radiation – came to an end, and the ionized hydrogen gradually reverted to neutral atoms.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt;

These observations have narrowed down the period of time during which reionization took place, but the source of the photons that caused reionization is still not completely certain. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to [[ultraviolet]] photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter, implying that the sources must have produced significant amount of ultraviolet and higher energy. Protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart, which also sets limits on how numerous the sources were and their longevity.&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

However, by this time, matter had become far more spread out due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. Although the neutral hydrogen atoms were again ionized, the plasma was much more thin and diffuse, and photons were much less likely to be scattered. Despite being reionized, the universe remained largely transparent during reionization. As the universe continued to cool and expand, reionization gradually ended.

Matter continues to draw together under the influence of [[gravity]], to form [[galaxy|galaxies]]. The stars from this time period, known as  [[Stellar population|Population II]] stars, are formed early on in this process, with more recent [[Stellar population|Population I]] stars formed later. Gravitational attraction also gradually pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, [[galactic cluster|cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.

== Current appearance of the Universe==

The universe has appeared much the same as it does now, for many billions of years. It will continue to look similar for many more billions of years into the future.

Based upon the emerging science of [[nucleocosmochronology]], the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have been formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Peloso/&gt;

=== Dark energy dominated era===
{{main|dark energy|Scale factor (cosmology)}}
:''From about 9.8 billion years after the Big bang''
From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large-scale behavior is believed to have gradually changed for the third time in its history. Its behavior had originally been dominated by radiation ([[special relativity|relativistic]] constituents such as photons and neutrinos) for the first 47,000 years, and since about 377,000 years of cosmic time, its behavior had been dominated by [[matter]]. During its matter-dominated era, the expansion of the universe had begun to slow down, as [[gravity]] reigned in the initial outward expansion. But from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, observations show that that the expansion of the universe slowly stops decelerating, and gradually begins to accelerate again, instead. 

While the precise cause is not known, the observation is accepted as correct by the cosmologist community. By far the most accepted understanding is that this is due to an unknown form of energy which has been given the name "[[dark energy]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P|last1=Peebles|first1=P.

Research is ongoing to understand this dark energy. Dark energy is now believed to be the single largest component of the universe, as it constitutes about 68.3% of the entire [[mass-energy]] of the physical universe.

Dark energy is believed to act like a [[cosmological constant]] - a [[scalar field]] that exists throughout space. Unlike gravity, the effects of such a field do not diminish (or only diminish slowly) as the universe grows. While matter and gravity have a greater effect initially, their effect quickly diminishes as the universe continues to expand. Objects in the universe, which are initially seen to be moving apart as the universe expands, continue to move apart, but their outward motion gradually slows down. This slowing effect becomes smaller as the universe becomes more spread out. Eventually, the outward and repulsive effect of dark energy begins to dominate over the inward pull of gravity. Instead of slowing down and perhaps beginning to move inward under the influence of gravity, from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, the expansion of space starts to slowly accelerate ''outward'' at a gradually ''increasing'' rate.

==Far future and ultimate fate==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe|Timeline of the far future}}
{{further|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe}}

The universe has existed for around 13.8 billion years, and we believe that we understand it well enough to predict its large-scale development for many billions of years into the future – perhaps as much as 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years from now). Beyond that, we need to better understand the universe to make any accurate predictions. Therefore, the universe could follow a variety of different paths beyond this time.

There are several competing scenarios for the possible long-term evolution of the universe. Which of them will happen, if any, depends on the precise values of [[physical constant]]s such as the [[cosmological constant]], the possibility of [[proton decay]], the [[False vacuum|energy of the vacuum]] (meaning, the energy of [[Vacuum state|"empty" space]] itself), and the natural laws [[beyond the Standard Model]].

If the expansion of the universe continues and it stays in its present form, eventually all but the nearest galaxies will be carried away from us by the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] at such a velocity that our [[observable universe]] will be limited to [[Laniakea Supercluster|our own]] gravitationally bound local [[galactic cluster]]. In the very long term (after many trillions – thousands of billions – of years, cosmic time), the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end, as stars cease to be born and even the [[red dwarf star|longest-lived stars]] gradually die. Beyond this, all objects in the universe will cool and (with the [[proton decay|possible exception of protons]]) gradually decompose back to their constituent particles and then into subatomic particles and very low level photons and other [[fundamental particle]]s, by a variety of possible processes. But this will take a duration of time that is almost inconceivable to most people, compared to which the entire 13.8 billion years of the universe would be a tiny instant in time.

Ultimately, in the extreme future, the following scenarios have been proposed for the ultimate fate of the universe.

{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''[[Heat death of the universe|Heat Death]]'''
| As expansion continues, the universe becomes larger, colder, and more dilute; in time, all structures eventually decompose to subatomic particles and photons.
| In the case of indefinitely continuing [[metric expansion of space]], the energy density in the universe will decrease until, after an estimated time of  10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; years, it reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and no more structure will be possible. This will happen only after an extremely long time because first, all matter will collapse into [[black hole]]s, which will then evaporate extremely slowly via [[Hawking radiation]]. The universe in this scenario will cease to be able to support life much earlier than this, after some 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; years or so, when  [[star formation]] ceases.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337|title=A dying universe: The long-term fate and evolutionof astrophysical objects|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=69|issue=2|pages=337–372|last1=Adams|first1=Fred C|last2=Laughlin|first2=Gregory|year=1997|arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IID.&lt;/sup&gt;  In some [[grand unified theories]], [[proton decay]] after at least 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; years will convert the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons (such as positrons and electrons) and photons. Some positrons and electrons will then recombine into photons.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IV,&amp;nbsp;§VF.&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, the universe has reached a high-[[entropy]] state consisting of a bath of particles and low-energy radiation. It is not known however whether it eventually achieves [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§VIB,&amp;nbsp;VID.&lt;/sup&gt; The hypothesis of a universal heat death stems from the 1850s ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] ([[Lord Kelvin]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1851). "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam." Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', March, 1851; and ''Philosophical Magazine'' IV. 1852, [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt; who extrapolated the theory of heat views of mechanical energy loss in nature, as embodied in the first two laws of thermodynamics, to universal operation.
|-
| '''[[Big Rip]]'''
| Expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] are pulled apart and unable to exist.
| For sufficiently large values for the [[dark energy]] content of the universe, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. Gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and ultimately the Solar System will be torn apart. Eventually the expansion will be so rapid as to overcome the electromagnetic forces holding molecules and atoms together. Even atomic nuclei will be torn apart. Finally, forces and interactions even on the [[Planck scale]] – the smallest size for which the notion of "space" currently has a meaning – will no longer be able to occur as the fabric of [[spacetime]] itself is pulled apart and the universe as we know it will end in an unusual kind of singularity.
|-
| '''[[Big Crunch]]'''
| Expansion eventually slows and halts, then reverses as all matter accelerates towards its common centre. Not now considered likely.
| In the opposite of the "Big Rip" scenario, the [[metric expansion of space]] would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. This is a required element of [[oscillatory universe]] scenarios, such as the [[cyclic model]], although a Big Crunch does not necessarily imply an oscillatory universe. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
|-
| '''[[Vacuum instability]]'''
| Collapse of the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, to a different form.
| Cosmology traditionally has assumed a stable or at least  [[metastability|metastable]] universe, but the possibility of a [[false vacuum]] in [[quantum field theory]] implies that the universe at any point in spacetime might spontaneously collapse into a lower energy state (see [[Bubble nucleation]]), a more stable or "true vacuum", which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is our vacuum metastable? |journal=Nature |volume=298 |date=1982 |issue=5875 |pages=633–634 |doi=10.1038/298633a0 |bibcode=1982Natur.298..633T |url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/%2872%29vacuum_metastable.pdf |access-date=2015-10-31|last1=Turner |first1=M.

The effect would be that the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, would undergo a transition to a more stable form. New forces and particles would replace the present ones we know of, with the side effect that all current particles, forces and structures would be destroyed and subsequently (if able) reform into different particles, forces and structures.

In this kind of extreme timescale, extremely rare [[quantum mechanics|quantum phenomena]] may also occur that are extremely unlikely to be seen on a timescale smaller than trillions of years. These may also lead to unpredictable changes to the state of the universe which would not be likely to be significant on any smaller timescale. For example, on a timescale of millions of trillions of years, [[black hole]]s might appear to evaporate almost instantly, uncommon [[quantum tunneling]] phenomena would appear to be common, and quantum (or other) phenomena so unlikely that they might occur just once in a trillion years may occur many times.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}
'''Closure''' is the term used to refer to the actions necessary when it is no longer necessary or possible for a [[business]] or other organization to continue to operate.  Closure may be the result of a [[bankruptcy]], where the organization lacks sufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the [[proprietor]] of the business dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another organization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is the non-surviving entity in a [[corporate merger]].  A closure may occur because the purpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.

While a closure is typically of a business or a [[non-profit organization]], any [[entity]] which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a single church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for some reason, it ceases to exist.

Closures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of organizations are much rarer than involuntary ones{{fact|date=December 2013}}, as, in the absence of some change making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will continue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.

The most common form of voluntary closure would be when those involved in an organization such as a social club, a band, or other non-profit organization decide to cease operating. Once the organization has paid any outstanding debts and completed any pending operations, closure may simply mean that the organization ceases to exist.

If an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform a liquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are converted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is distributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law{{clarifyme|date=December 2013}} any remaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.

If an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare bankruptcy. If the organization is viable, it may reorganizes itself as a result of the bankruptcy and continue operations. If it is not viable for the business to continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy [[liquidation]]: its assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be liquidated, and the business ceases operations.

Possibly the largest "closure" in history (but more closely analogous to a demerger) was the split of the [[Soviet Union]] into its constituent countries. In comparison, the end of [[East Germany]] can be considered a [[merger]] rather than a closure as [[West Germany]] assumed all of the assets and liabilities of [[East Germany]]. The end of the Soviet Union was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because while [[Russia]] assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former Soviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is responsible for unpaid [[parking ticket]]s accumulated by [[motor vehicle]]s operated on behalf of [[diplomatic mission]]s operated by the former Soviet Union in other countries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.

Several major business closures include the bankruptcy of the [[Penn Central]] railroad, the [[Enron scandal]]s, and [[MCI Worldcom]]'s bankruptcy and eventual merger into [[Verizon]].

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EgyptAir Flight 648''' was a regularly scheduled international flight between Athens [[Ellinikon International Airport]] in Greece and [[Cairo International Airport]] in Egypt. On 23 November 1985, a [[Boeing 737-200]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 11241985 |publisher=Airdisaster.com |date=November 24, 1985 |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220085212/http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; airliner, registered SU-AYH, servicing the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by the terrorist organization [[Abu Nidal]]. The subsequent raid on the aircraft by [[Egypt]]ian troops resulted in dozens of deaths, making the hijacking of Flight 648 one of the deadliest such incidents in history. 

==Hijacking==
On 23 November 1985, Flight 648 took off at 8pm on its [[Athens]]-to-[[Cairo]] route. Ten minutes after takeoff, three [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] members of Abu Nidal hijacked the aircraft. The [[Palestinian political violence|terrorists]], calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were heavily armed with guns and [[grenade]]s.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The terrorist leader, [[Omar Rezaq]], proceeded to check all [[passport]]s. At this point, an Egyptian Security Service agent, Mustafa Kamal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newdominion.com/2012/03/03/interpol-investigates-terror-in-the-skies.html Interpol Investigates – Terror in the Skies&lt;/ref&gt; aboard opened fire, killing one terrorist before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the [[fuselage]] was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to allow the crew and passengers to breathe.

[[Libya]] was the original destination for the hijackers, but due to negative publicity the hijacking would have had if flown to Libya and the fact that the plane did not have enough fuel, [[Malta]] was chosen as a more suitable option. The aircraft was running dangerously low on fuel, experiencing serious pressurization problems and carrying a number of wounded passengers. However, Maltese authorities did not give permission for the aircraft to land; the Maltese government had previously refused permission to other hijacked aircraft, including on 23 September 1982 when an [[Alitalia]] aircraft was hijacked on its way to [[Italy]]. The EgyptAir 648 hijackers insisted, and forced the [[Aviator|pilot]], Hani Galal, to land at [[Luqa Airport]]. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the landing, the runway lights were switched off, but the pilot managed to land the damaged aircraft safely.

The Mexican passengers were actress Lupita Pallás and her daughter Laila Ortiz de Pinedo, mother and sister of Mexican actor [[Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo]].

==Standoff==
At first, Maltese authorities were optimistic they could solve the crisis. Malta had good relations with the [[Arab world]], and 12 years earlier had successfully resolved a potentially more serious situation when a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 747]] landed there under similar circumstances. The Maltese Prime Minister, [[Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici]], rushed to the airport's control tower and assumed responsibility for the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20101123/local/anniversary-of-a-massacre-the-egyptair-hijacking-in-malta.337385|title=Anniversary of a massacre – The EgyptAir hijack in Malta|date=23 November 2010|work=[[Times of Malta]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430015446/http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2011|title=10 Most Terrifying Airplane Hijackings of All Time|date=|work=[[Criminal Justice Degrees Guide]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by an interpreter, he refused to refuel the aircraft, or to withdraw Maltese armed forces which had surrounded the plane, until all passengers were released. Eleven passengers and two injured flight attendants were allowed off the plane. The hijackers then started shooting hostages, starting with Tamar Artzi, an Israeli woman, whom they shot in the head and back. Artzi survived her wounds.  Rezaq, the chief hijacker, threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. His next victim was Nitzan Mendelson, another Israeli woman, killing her. He then shot three Americans – Patrick Scott Baker, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp and Jackie Nink Pflug. Of the five passengers shot, Artzi, Baker and Pflug survived; Mendelson died in a Maltese hospital a week after the hijacking. A British passenger commented that he saw that Rezaq had to raise his gun in order to shoot Baker, who was about 6' 5" tall.

France, the United Kingdom and the United States all offered to send anti-hijack forces. Bonnici was under heavy pressure from both the hijackers and from the United States and Egypt, whose ambassadors were at the airport. The non-aligned Maltese government feared that the Americans or the Israelis would arrive and take control of the area, as the U.S. [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] was only 20 minutes away. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with an aeromedical evacuation team from [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] (2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) near [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and rapid-deploying surgical teams from Wiesbaden Air Force Medical Center were on standby at the U.S. Navy Hospital at [[Naples]]. When the U.S. told Maltese authorities that Egypt had a special forces counterterrorism team trained by the U.S. [[Delta Force]] ready to move in, they were granted permission to come. The Egyptian [[Unit 777]] under the command of Major-General [[Kamal Attia]] was flown in, led by four American officers. Negotiations were prolonged as much as possible, and it was agreed that the plane should be attacked on the morning of 25 November when food was to be taken into the aircraft. Soldiers dressed up as caterers would jam the door open and attack.

==Raid==
Without warning Egyptian commandos launched the raid about an hour and a half before it had been originally planned. They blasted open the passenger doors and luggage compartment doors with explosives. Bonnici claimed that these unauthorized explosions caused the internal plastic of the plane to catch fire, causing widespread [[suffocation]]. On the other hand, the ''[[Times of Malta]]'', quoting sources at the airport on the day, held that when the hijackers realized that they were being attacked, they lobbed hand grenades into the passenger area, killing people and starting the fire aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19851124-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737–266 SU-AYH Malta-Luqa Airport (MLA) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storming of the aircraft killed 54 of the remaining 87 passengers, as well as two crew members and one hijacker. Only one hijacker — Omar Rezaq, who had survived — remained undetected by the Maltese government. The terrorist leader, who was injured during the storming of the aircraft, had removed his hood and ammunition and pretended to be an injured passenger. Egyptian commandos tracked Rezaq to St. Luke's General Hospital and, holding the doctors and medical staff at gunpoint, entered the casualty ward looking for him. He was arrested when some of the passengers in the hospital recognized him.

A total of 58 of the 95 passengers and crew had died, as well as two of the three hijackers, by the time the crisis was over. Maltese medical examiners estimated that eight passengers were shot dead by the commandos.

Rezaq faced trial in Malta, but with no anti-terrorism legislation, he was tried on other charges. There was widespread fear that terrorists would hijack a Maltese plane or carry out a terrorist attack in Malta as an act of retribution. Rezaq received a 25-year sentence, of which he served eight. His release caused a diplomatic incident between Malta and the U.S. because Maltese law strictly prohibited trying a person twice, in any jurisdiction, on charges connected to the same series of events (having wider limitations compared to classic [[double jeopardy]]). Following his immediate expulsion on release, he was captured on arrival in [[Nigeria]]. After three months he was handed over to the U.S., brought before a U.S. court and, on 7 October 1996, sentenced to life imprisonment with a no-parole recommendation.

==Aftermath and criticism==
In his 1989 book ''[[Massacre in Malta]]'', [[John A. Mizzi]] writes:

{{cquote|Malta was faced with a problem it was ill-equipped to meet. The authorities took a firm stand in denying fuel to the hijackers but made no sensible provisions, through political bias and lack of experience, to meet the circumstances that arose from this decision. No proper team was set up at the outset to evaluate or deal progressively with the crisis, although only a few days previously an incident management course had been organized by a team of U.S. experts in Malta at the request of the government.&lt;ref name="Mizzi"&gt;Mizzi, J.A. (1989). ''Massacre in Malta : The Hijack of Egyptair MS 648'', 72 p:ill. J.A. Mizzi – Valletta : Technografica, 1989. DDC : 364.162&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mizzi adds:

{{cquote|The Egyptian commandos were given too free a hand and they acted out of their mission with little regard for the safety of the passengers. They were determined to get the hijackers at all costs and the Maltese government's initial refusal for U.S. anti-terrorist resources (a team led by a major-general with listening devices and other equipment) offered by the [[State Department]] through the U.S. Embassy in Malta – a decision reversed too late – contributed in no small measure to the mismanagement of the entire operation.&lt;ref name="Mizzi" /&gt;}}

Mizzi also mentions how Maltese soldiers positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft were equipped with rifles but were not issued ammunition. An Italian secret service report on the incident showed how the fire inside the aircraft was caused by the Egyptian commandos who placed explosives in the aircraft cargo hold – the most vulnerable part of the aircraft, as it held the oxygen tanks which blew up. During the hijacking, only the Socialist Party media and state-controlled television were given information on the incident. Such was the [[censorship]] of the media, that the Maltese people first heard of the disaster through [[RAI TV]], when its correspondent [[Enrico Mentana]] spoke live on the air via a direct phone call: "Parlo da Malta. Qui c'è stato un massacro ..." ("I'm speaking from Malta. Here there's just been a massacre ...") Shortly before this broadcast, a news bulletin on the Maltese national television had erroneously stated that all passengers had been released and were safe.

Decisions taken by the Maltese government drew criticism from overseas. The United States protested to Malta about U.S. personnel sent to resolve the issue having been confined to Air Squadron HQ and the U.S. Embassy in [[Floriana]]. The United States had seen the situation as so ‘hot’ that it had ordered a number of its naval ships, including an aircraft carrier, to move toward Malta for contingency purposes.

EgyptAir still flies the Athens–Cairo route, now assigned flight numbers 748 and 750 and is now performed by [[Boeing 737-800]]. The [[flight number]] 648 
is now on its Riyadh–Cairo route.

==In popular culture==
The events of the hijacking were related in an account by American survivor Jackie Nink Pflug, who had been shot in the head, on the [[Biography Channel]] television program ''[[I Survived...]]'', which was broadcast on 13 April 2009. Laurence Zrinzo, the neurologist and neurosurgeon who established neurosurgery as a sub-speciality in the Maltese islands, performed Ms Pflug's neurosurgical procedure. Ms Pflug also related details about the flight and the attack in her 2001 book, ''Miles to Go Before I Sleep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jackie Nink Pflug|author2=Peter Kizilos|title=Miles to Go Before I Sleep: A Survivor's Story of Life After a Terrorist Hijacking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=royVNfdQE6cC&amp;pg=PA102|year=2001|publisher=Hazelden Publishing|isbn=978-1-56838-837-3|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was chronicled and reenacted in an ''[[Interpol Investigates]]'' episode, [[Interpol Investigates#Terror in the Skies|"Terror in the Skies"]], broadcast by the [[National Geographic Channel]].

The hijacking is also the subject of the book ''Valinda, Our Daughter'', written by Canadian author [[Gladys Taylor (publisher)|Gladys Taylor]].

The events of the hijacking are described in and used to further the plot in [[Brad Thor]]'s novel Path of the Assassin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9709">In [[philosophy]], '''events''' are objects in [[time]] or instantiations of [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] in objects.

==Kim’s property-exemplification==

[[Jaegwon Kim]] theorized that events are structured.&lt;br&gt;
They are composed of three things:
# Object(s) [x],
# a property [P] and
# time or a [[Time standard|temporal interval]] [t].
Events are defined using the [[operational definition|operation]] [x, P, t].&lt;br&gt;
A unique event is defined by two principles:&lt;br&gt;
:a) the existence condition and
:b) the identity condition.
The existence condition states “[x, P, t] exists if and only if object x exemplifies the n-adic P at time t”. This means a unique event exists if the above is met. The identity condition states “[x, P, t] is [y, Q, t`] if and only if x=y, P=Q and t=t`].

Kim uses these to define events under five conditions:
# One, they are unrepeatable, unchangeable [[particular]]s that include changes and the states and conditions of that event.
# Two, they have a [[semi-temporal]] location.
# Three, only their constructive property creates distinct events.
# Four, holding a constructive property as a generic event creates a type-token relationship between events, and events are not limited to their three requirements (i.e. [x, P, t]). Critics of this theory such as [[Myles Brand]] have suggested that the theory be modified so that an event had a [[spacetime|spatiotemporal]] region; consider the event of a flash of lightning. The idea is that an event must include both the span of time of the flash of lightning and the area in which it occurred.

&lt;!-- ****************************** --&gt;
&lt;!-- the fifth condition is missing!--&gt;
&lt;!-- ****************************** --&gt;

Other problems exist within Kim’s theory, as he never specified what properties were (e.g. [[universals]], [[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]], natural classes, etc.). In addition, it is not specified if properties are few or abundant. The following is Kim’s response to the above.

{{Quotation|. . . [T]he basic generic events may be best picked out relative to a scientific theory, whether the theory is a common-sense theory of the behavior of middle-sized objects or a highly sophisticated physical theory. They are among the important properties, relative to the theory, in terms of which lawful regularities can be discovered, described, and explained. The basic parameters in terms of which the laws of the theory are formulated would, on this view, give us our basic generic events, and the usual logical, mathematical, and perhaps other types of operations on them would yield complex, defined generic events. We commonly recognize such properties as motion, colors, temperatures, weights, pushing, and breaking, as generic events and states, but we must view this against the background of our common-sense explanatory and predictive scheme of the world around us. I think it highly likely that we cannot pick out generic events completely ''a priori''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaegwon Kim]] (1993) ''Supervenience and Mind'', page 37, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is also a major debate about the essentiality of a constitutive object. There are two major questions involved in this: If one event occurs, could it have occurred in the same manner if it were another person, and could it occur in the same manner if it would have occurred at a different time? Kim holds that neither are true and that different conditions (i.e. a different person or time) would lead to a separate event. However, some consider it natural to assume the opposite.

==Davidson==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[John Lemmon]] proposed a theory of events that had two major conditions, respectively: a causal criterion and a spatiotemporal criterion.

The causal criterion defines an event as two events being the same if and only if they have the same [[Causality|cause and effect]].

The spatiotemporal criterion defines an event as two events being the same if and only if they occur in the same [[space]] at the same [[time]]. Davidson however provided this scenario; if a metal ball becomes warmer during a certain minute, and during the same minute rotates through 35 degrees, must we say that these are the same event? However, one can argue that the warming of the ball and the rotation are possibly temporally separated and are therefore separate events.

==Lewis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] theorized that events are merely spatiotemporal regions and properties (i.e. [[element (mathematics)|membership of a class]]). He defines an event as “e is an event only if it is a class of spatiotemporal regions, both thisworldly (assuming it occurs in the actual world) and otherworldly.” The only problem with this definition is it only tells us what an event could be, but does not define a unique event. This theory entails [[modal realism]], which assumes [[possible worlds]] exist; worlds are defined as sets containing all objects that exist as a part of that set. However, this theory is controversial. Some philosophers have attempted to remove possible worlds, and reduce them to other [[Subjunctive possibility|entities]]. They hold that the world we exist in is the only world that actually exists, and that possible worlds are only possibilities.

Lewis’ theory is composed of four key points. Firstly, the non-duplication principle; it states that x and y are separate events if and only if there is one member of x that is not a member of y (or vice versa). Secondly, there exist regions that are subsets of possible worlds and thirdly, events are not structured by an essential time.

==Badiou==

In [[Alain Badiou#Introduction to ''Being and Event''|''Being and Event'']], [[Alain Badiou]] writes that the event (''événement'') is a multiple which basically does not make sense according to the rules of the "situation," in other words existence.  Hence, the event "is not," and therefore, in order for there to be an event, there must be an "intervention" which changes the rules of the situation in order to allow that particular event to be ("to be" meaning to be a multiple which belongs to the multiple of the situation&amp;nbsp;— these terms are drawn from or defined in reference to [[set theory]]).  In his view, there is no "one," and everything that {{not a typo|is is}} a "multiple."  "One" happens when the situation "counts," or accounts for, acknowledges, or defines something: it "counts it as one."  For the event to be counted as one by the situation, or counted in the one of the situation, an intervention needs to decide its belonging to the situation.  This is because his definition of the event violates the prohibition against self-belonging (in other words, it is a set-theoretical definition which violates set theory's rules of consistency), thus does not count as extant on its own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Badiou]] (1988) ''L'Être et l'Événement''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deleuze==
[[Gilles Deleuze]] lectured on the concept of ''event'' on March 10, 1987. A sense of the lecture is described by James Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Stivale (editor) (2011) ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'', 2nd edition, chapter 6: Event, pp 80–90&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also wrote, "From the point of view of the difference between two possible worlds, the event is all important".&lt;ref&gt;James Williams (2003) ''Gilles Deleuze’s [[Difference and Repetition]]: A Critical Introduction and Guide'', page 78, [[Edinburgh University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, "Every event is revolutionary due to an integration of signs, acts and structures through the whole event. Events are distinguished by the intensity of this revolution, rather than the types of freedom or chance."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003 p xi&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Deleuze published a magazine article "Signes et événements"&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze (1988) "Signes et événements", ''Magazine Littéraire'', #257, pages 16 to 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Nietszche and Philosophy'', he addresses the question "Which one is beautiful?" In the preface to the English translation he wrote:
:The one that ... does not refer to an individual, to a person, but rather to an event, that is, to the forces in their various relationships to a proposition or phenomenon, and the genetic relationship that determines these forces (power).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hart (1993) ''Gilles Deleuze: An apprenticeship in philosophy'', page 31, [[University of Minnesota Press]] {{ISBN|0-8166-2160-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kirkeby==
The Danish philosopher [[Ole Fogh Kirkeby]] deserves mentioning, as he has written a comprehensive trilogy about the event, or in Danish "begivenheden". In the first work of the trilogy "Eventum tantum – begivenhedens ethos"&lt;ref&gt;Ole Fogh Kirkeby (2005) ''Eventum tantum : Begivenhedens ethos.'' København: Samfundslitteratur&lt;/ref&gt; (Eventum tantum - the ethos of the event) he distinguishes between three levels of the event, inspired from [[Nicola Cusanus]]: Eventum tantum as non aliud, the alma-event and the proto-event.

==History==

Event chain methodology is an extension of traditional Monte Carlo simulation of project schedules where uncertainties in task duration and costs are defined by statistical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, task duration can be defined by three point estimates: low, base, and high. The results of analysis is a risk adjusted project schedule, crucial tasks, and probabilities that project will be completed on time and on budget. Defining uncertainties using statistical distribution provide accurate results if there is a reliable historical data about duration and cost of similar tasks in previous projects. Another approach is to define uncertainties using risk events or risk drivers, which can be assigned to different tasks or resources.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Information about probabilities and impact of such events is easier to elicit, which improves accuracy of analysis. Risks can be recorded in the [[Risk register]]. Event chain methodology was first proposed in the period of 2002-2004.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Event Chain Methodology is based on six principles and has a number of outcomes.

==Principles==

===Moment of risk and state of activity===

[[File:EventChainDiagramForOneActivity.png|thumb|355px|Event chain diagram for one activity]]Activities (tasks) are not a continuous uniform procedure. Tasks are affected by external events, which transform an activity from one state to another. One of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event occurs during the course of an activity. This moment, when an event occurs, in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using [[statistical distribution]]. The original state is called a ground state, other states are called excited states. For example, if the team completes their job on activity, they can move to other activities. The notion of an activity's state is important because certain events can or cannot occur when activity is in certain state. It means that the state of an activity is subscribed to the events. Events can be local, affecting particular tasks or resources, or global affecting all tasks or resources.

===Event chains===

Events can be related to other events, which will create event chains. These event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. 
For example, requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed. To accelerate the activity, the project manager allocates a resource from another activity, which then leads to a missed deadline. Eventually, this can lead to the failure of the project. It could be different relationship between events. One event can trigger one or multiple events.

Events can be correlated with each other without one triggering another one. In this case if one risk has occurred, another one will occur and vice versa. One event assigned in one activity can execute another activity or group of activities. In many cases it the execution of risk response plans. For example, event “structural defect is discovered” can cause one or many activities “Repair”. Events can cause other events to occur either immediately or with a delay. The delay is a property of the event subscription. The delay can be deterministic, but in most cases, it is probabilistic. Also risks can be transferred from one activity to another. To define event chains, we need to identify a "sender", the event that initiates the chain of events. The sender event can cause one or more events that effect multiple activities. These are called "receiver" events. In turn, the receiver events can also act as sender events.

===Event chain diagrams===
[[File:EventChainDiagramExample1.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram: local and global threats and opportunities with different probabilities and impacts]]
[[Event chain diagram]] is a visualization that shows the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other.&lt;ref&gt;Virine, Lev &amp; McVean, Jason. (2004). Visual Modeling of Business Problems: Workflow and Patterns, In Proceedings of 2004 Winter Simulation Conference, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Virine, Lev &amp; Rapley, Lisa. (2003). Visualization of Probabilistic Business Models, In Proceedings of 2003 Winter Simulation Conference, New Orleans, LA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart. Here are a few important rules:

*Event chains diagrams present events as arrows on the Gantt charts.  
*Arrows pointing down are threats. Arrows pointing up are opportunities. 
*Issues are shown as an arrow within a circle. Color of the issue arrow is red (dark).
*Closed or transferred risks are shown using dashed lines. Color of arrow is white. Closed issue is shown in the circle with dashed border line. 
*Excited states are represented by elevating the associated section of the bar on the Gantt chart. 
*Colors represent the calculated impact of the risk. Higher impacts are red or darker shade. Low impacts are green or lighter shade. The size of the arrow represents probability.
*Event chains are shown as lines connecting arrows depicting events.
*Event chains may trigger another activity. In this case event chain line will be connected with the beginning of activity with optional arrow.
*Event chains may trigger a group of activities. In this case this group of activities will be surrounded by the box or frame and event chain line will be connected to the corner of the box or first activity within a frame.
By using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.

[[File:EventChainDiagramExample.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram with critical event chain and activity triggered by event]]
Another tool that can be used to simplify the definition of events is a state table. Columns in the state table represent events; rows represent the states of an activity. Information for each event in each state includes four properties of event subscription: probability, moment of event, excited state, and impact of the event.

===Monte Carlo simulation===
Once events and event chains are defined, quantitative analysis using [[Monte Carlo simulation]] can be performed to quantify the cumulative effect of the events.&lt;ref&gt;Goran Avlijas. (2018). Examining the Value of Monte Carlo Simulation for Project Time Management. Management:Journal of Sustainable Business and Management Solutions in Emerging Economies. 10.7595/management.fon.2018.0004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashyap, Heena. (2016). Risk Analysis and Estimation of Schedule Using Monte Carlo Simulation. International Journal Of Engineering And Computer Science. 10.18535/ijecs/v5i9.42&lt;/ref&gt; Probabilities and impacts of risks assigned to activities are used as input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the project schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, T. "Why Monte Carlo simulations of project networks can mislead". Project Management Journal, Vol 35. Issue 3, (2004): 53-61&lt;/ref&gt; In most projects it is necessary to supplement the event based variance with uncertainties as distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other parameters.

In Event chain methodology, risk can not only affect schedule and cost, but also other parameters such as safety, security, performance, technology, quality, and other objectives. In other words one event can belong to different categories.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Ruchi. and Virine, Lev. (2017). Monte Carlo Project Risk Analysis. In Raydugin, Y. (ed) Handbook of Research on Leveraging Risk and Uncertainties for Effective Project Management. IGI Global; 1 edition&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the analysis would show risk exposure for different categories as well as integrated project risk score for all categories. This integrated project risk score is calculated based on relative weights for each risk category.

===Critical event chains===
Monte Carlo simulation provides the capability, through sensitivity analysis, to identify single or chains of events. These chains of events can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main project parameters, such as project duration or cost, and the event chains. These  are called “critical events” or “critical chains of events”. By identifying critical events or critical chains of events, we can identify strategies to minimize their negative effects: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, or Accept. Event and event chain ranking is performed for all risk categories (schedule-related and non-schedule) as part of one process. Integrated risk probability, impact and score can be calculated using weights for each risk category.

===Project control with event and event chains===
Monitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is used to perform the analysis. During the course of the project, the probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual data. The main reason for  performance tracking is forecasting an activity’s duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and certain events are assigned to the activity. Event chain methodology reduces the risk probability and impact automatically based on the percent of work completed. Advanced analysis can be performed using a Bayesian approach. It is possible to monitor the chance that a project will meet a specific deadline. This chance is constantly updated as a result of the Monte Carlo analysis. Critical events and event chains can be different at the various phases of the project

==Phenomena==

===Repeated activities===
[[File:RepeatedActivity.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Repeated Activity]]Sometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already been completed. This is a very common scenario for real life projects; sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of a succeeding activity. Event chain methodology simplifies modeling of these scenarios The original project schedule does not need to be updated, all that is required is to define the event and assign it to an activity that points to the previous activity. In addition, a limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated must be defined.

===Event chains and risk response===
[[File:MitigationPlan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mitigation plan]]If an event or event chain occurs during the course of a project, it may require some risk response effort. 
Risk response plans execution are triggered by events, which occur if an activity is in an excited state. Risk response events may attempt to transform the activity from the excited state to the ground state. Response plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the response plan to an event or event chain. The same response plan can be used for one or more events.

===Resource allocation based on events===
One potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity. Reallocation 
of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value. Events can be used to model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.

'''Event videography''' is a [[video production]], the art of capturing social and special events onto video by a [[videographer]]. The term is used to describe the [[videography]] of any event, aside from weddings and [[wedding videography]].

==History==
Event videography is an offshoot of wedding videography and encompasses the video documentation of social functions, such as [[First Communion]]s, anniversaries, dance recitals, bar mitzvahs, color guard contests, [[prom]]s, concerts, etc.

Event videography started shortly after the introduction of consumer-based video cameras, or [[camcorders]], in the late 1970s, as videographers, who had businesses documenting weddings, began to look for other [[Market (economics)|market]]s to offer their services.

==Event videography today==
The art of event videography is somewhat similar today as it was back when the camcorder was first introduced. The main differences lie in the improved video camera technology and equipment. Advances in [[High-definition video|high definition]] technology are being applied to event videography.

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

=== Geohazards in Earth's history ===
Eleven distinct [[flood basalt]] episodes occurred in the past 250 million years, resulting in [[large volcanic province]]s, creating [[plateau]]s and [[mountain range]]s on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4866/663 http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Rampino_Stothers_1.pdf|authors=[[Michael R.

The timing of six out of eleven known provinces coincide with periods of [[global warming]] and marine [[Anoxic event|anoxia]]/dysoxia. Thus, suggesting that volcanic CO2 emissions can force an important effect on the [[climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825200000374|author=P.B.

The '''Hunchun incident''' (October 2, 1920) was a reported raid on a [[Japan]]ese consulate in Manchuria resulting in the death of thirteen Japanese.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Japanese government used this incident to justify sending thousands of Imperial Japanese troops into [[Manchuria]] on October 5, 1920. These escalations culminated with the [[Battle of Qingshanli]] (October 21–26, 1920) between [[Japan]] and the Korean Independence Army,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  where [[Koreans|Korean]] rebels fought Japanese soldiers.

==Background==

For more than a decade prior to Korea’s [[March 1st Movement]] (1919) nationalist groups of Korean rebels, many of whom were former soldiers in the Korean army, organized into various pro-independence factions in Manchuria.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Due to its strategic location across the Korean border, guerilla fighters could effectively launch raids on Japanese consular police stations, and then retreat back to the Chinese side of the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Hong Pomdo (a previous [[Righteous Army]] leader) created the Korean Independence Army and trained so-called independence fighters in [[Yanji]]. Additionally, the Northern Route Military Headquarters was established under the leadership of So Il, with Kim Chwajin commanding more than four hundred independence fighters at its officer training school. Separately, Yi Tonghwi also trained over 3,000 independence fighters in Hunchun and armed them with weapons provided by the Red [[Bolshevik]] army.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the March 1st Movement’s failure to secure independence and arouse international sentiments toward the Koreans’ plight under Japanese colonial rule, disaffected Koreans came together on April 13, 1919 in Shanghai to form a republican Korean provisional government with the hope of working together with the independence factions in Manchuria to eventually obtain freedom from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Robinson, 2007, Korea’s Twentieth-Century Odyssey: A Short History (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the momentum behind Korean independence movements in Manchuria increased, Japanese consular police chief Suematsu Kichiji became increasingly concerned about increasing radical Bolshevism among Koreans. To try and suppress these movements, he ordered numerous illegal police raids on suspected radical Jiandao base camps, which were protested by local Chinese leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is clear that some of the Korean guerrilla fighters in Manchuria were influenced by leftist ideologies, the major factions primarily supported the [[Shanghai Provisional Government]] and were focused primarily on Korean independence and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angered by the Japanese suppression of the March 1st Movement, Korean independence fighters in Manchuria began increasing their raids against Japanese border posts, killing numerous Japanese guards, with the eventual goal of advancing into Korea to remove the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early summer months of 1920, Korean rebels fought with Japanese troops in thirty-two battles along the border. After one particular Japanese counterattack, Hong Pomdo’s forces surrounded and killed 120 Japanese soldiers and wounded more than 200.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack and Controversy==

In effort to contain the Korean rebels, Japan petitioned both [[Tokyo]] and the Chinese government to help, but received little assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequently, on October 2, 1920, a Japanese consulate in the Chinese city of [[Hunchun]] in [[Jilin]] Province was attacked and burned to the ground purportedly (according to Japanese sources) by the Korean Independence Army, killing thirteen Japanese people.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Text of Bryce EUlogies and Statement on Siberia |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/24/98975084.pdf |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=January 24, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was further reported that the “bandits” carrying out this attack “committed indiscriminate acts of murder and pillage” and “looted local shops.”&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many South Korean historians maintain, however, that the attack on Hunchun was not carried out by the Korean rebels, but rather was staged by the Japanese to justify incursion into Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some South Korean sources further believe that the attack was coordinated with Chinese bandit leader Ch'ang-chiang-hao who had been bribed by the Japanese to carry out the attack with several bandits in order to incriminate the Koreans. These sources maintain that Chang went further than the Japanese had requested him to in the scale of his attack.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Other South Korean scholars even maintain that the entire incident was a complete Japanese fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Korea]] is likewise skeptical about the Japanese narrative of the incident, with official sources recently asserting that “the Japanese imperialists cooked up the ‘Hunchun incident’ in which they hurled mounted bandits into attacking their consulate and kicked up a wholesale whirlwind of suppression against Koreans in Northeast China under that pretext.”&lt;ref&gt;"North Korea Criticizes Japan's ‘Punitive Operations’ in 1920." BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific, Oct 02, 2009, http://search.proquest.com/docview/460755521&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult for historians to determine who was behind the attack, or whether the incident actually took place, this controversial event is historically significant because Japan used it to justify its escalated military intervention in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan petitioned and received permission from China to send 15,000 troops from the 19th Division of the [[Chosen Army]] of Japan to contain the Korean rebel armies in Jilin province.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Aftermath==

In reaction to the Hunchun incident, a Japanese punitive “Jiandao Expedition” was accordingly sent to Manchuria, and used “search and destroy” patrols to suppress the guerrilla fighters by carrying out numerous arrests and executions.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 1920, a Korean Commission report described that Japanese soldiers had burned down thirty-two villages and killed “all the male inhabitants of the [Hunchun] district, and massacred 145 peaceful inhabitants.” One house was reportedly burned down with “women and children inside.”&lt;ref&gt;“Koreans Charge Cruelty,” New York Times, December 24, 1920, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/12/24/103519339.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Korean independence forces in Manchuria were never effectively organized under the leadership of the Shanghai Provisional Government, they did achieve notable military victories against the Japanese brigades.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most significant of these was the [[Battle of Qingshanli]], where about 400 Korean rebels were able to defeat the better-trained Japanese after four days of intense combat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history/independence_army.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In this battle the Koreans killed about 1,200 Japanese soldiers while losing only 60 of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to Japanese records, 11 soldiers were [[killed in action]], 24 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;陸軍第十九師團司令部　「間島事件鮮支人死傷者調」　大正十年二月二十五日&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1921, after a series of skirmishes and retreats on both sides, as well as criticism from local Chinese authorities and the international community, most members of the 19th Division withdrew from eastern Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the socialist-leaning Korean rebels were then recruited by the Red Bolshevik army to assist in its civil war prior to the formation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The term '''international crisis''' is widespread term without a single common definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acuto|first=Michele|title=Diplomats in Crisis|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=7 September 2011|volume=online|doi=10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To some, it involves "a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of [[war]]".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Glenn H. and Diesing, Paul: 1977. Conflict Among Nations: Bargaining, Decision Making and System Structure in International Crises. defines an international crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Lebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:
* '''Justification of Hostilities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lebow, Richard N.:1981. Between Peace and War: The Nature of International Crisis.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to [[war]] and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by [[Public image of George W. Bush|critics of George W. Bush]], is the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], which precipitated the [[Iraq War]].
* '''Spinoff Crisis'''. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] incident in 1915.
* '''Brinkmanship'''. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 is a well-known example of [[brinkmanship]].

With the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so. In the words of [[Groucho Marx]], "Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it".

==Strategies==
George's book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of [[crisis management]] as well as many examples.&lt;ref&gt;George, Alexander L (ed): 1991. Avoiding War: Problems of Crisis Management.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses a number of strategies, including:

===Offensive strategies===
*[[blackmail]]
*limited and reversible response
*controlled pressure
*[[attrition warfare|attrition]]
*[[fait accompli]]

===Defensive strategies===
*[[coercion]]
*limited [[conflict escalation|escalation]]
*[[tit-for-tat]]
*test of capabilities
*"drawing a line"
* Buying time strategy
* Conveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary

==List of defused crises==
International crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as [[Casus belli|causes of wars]]. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see [[List of wars]].
&lt;!-- 2008 South Ossetia war (C[ommonly]K[nown]A[s] Russo-Georgian war) belongs to aforementioned [[list of wars]] (or, more precisely, to [[List of wars 2003–10]]) rather than to "ongoing crises" below --&gt;
Given the above, some of the crises that are best-known ''as crises'' were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set of anger in countries:

* [[War in sight crisis]] (1875)
* [[Anglo-Portuguese Crisis]] (1889–1890)
* [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]], between Venezuela and the United Kingdom
* [[Fashoda Incident]] (1898–1899)

'''''Kalimantaan''''' is a novel by [[C. S. Godshalk]] offering a fictionalized account of the exploits of [[James Brooke]] in [[Sarawak]] in [[Borneo]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel uses of a variety of writing forms, including [[diary]] entries, [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, and straight [[Literary technique|narrative]] to tell its story. The author intentionally makes it difficult to determine what "really" happens in the story from dreams and fantasies of the characters.

==Plot summary==
In 1839, an English adventurer arrived on the northwest coast of [[Borneo]], commissioned to deliver a letter of gratitude to the [[Sultan of Brunei]] for having safely returned the crew of a British [[cargo ship|merchantman]], lost on his coast. It was a region full of [[headhunting|headhunter]]s, [[pirate]] tribes, and [[slave trade]]rs. Most Europeans with the temerity to enter the region had never been heard from again. This particular adventurer, however, seems to know how to play one power against another and manages to keep his balance in the midst of chaos. After performing a service for the Sultan (resolving a local tribal conflict through the use of his schooner's guns and leading an organized assault on a small native river fort), he is named governor of Sarawak, subject to the Sultan of Brunei. Within a few years, he has become the Rajah of Sarawak, an independent state, and established a dynasty that will last one hundred years.

Godshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. The real adventurer was [[James Brooke]]; Ms. Godshalk's is named Gideon Barr. James Brooke's schooner was named the ''Royalist''; Gideon Barr's is the ''Carolina'' (named after his mother). James Brooke was succeeded by his nephew, [[Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke|Charles Johnson]], who took the last name Brooke. Gideon Barr is succeeded by his nephew Richard Hogg (Ms. Godshalk does not deal with the change of last name since her story focuses on Gideon's life and ends with his death).

Although many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon's mother dies in Borneo much earlier while he is in grade school in England, providing him an emotional link to Borneo James Brooke did not have. James Brooke never married a European, although there is evidence that he was married to a Malay woman. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an "air of permanence" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on [[Margaret Brooke]], wife of the second Rajah, and her book "My Life in Sarawak". Gideon also maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship.

On the other hand, the 30,000 pounds that Brooke/Barr inherited at his father's death which enabled him to acquire his schooner, the massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The inquiry in Singapore was concerned with the battle of Labuan in which Brooke/Barr led British warships in a pre-emptive strike against a pirate fleet, breaking the power of the Bugis for the next twenty years. Brooke/Barr's enemies attempted to use this against him by claiming he had used British naval power to slaughter innocent natives.

Godshalk uses [[Malay language|Malay]] words extensively in the book. While she provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of ''Kalimantaan'' will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author:

On June 7, 2010, Jesus Mesa Jr., a U.S. Border Patrol agent, shot and killed Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca on the concrete riverbed separating Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico and  El Paso, Texas. At the time of the shooting Guereca, a 15-year-old-Mexican national was standing on the Mexican side of the [[US-Mexico border|Mexico–United States border]], while the agent was on the American side. The agent claimed after the shooting that he had used deadly force because Guereca had been throwing rocks.
The shooting led to a protracted court case which examined whether the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th amendment]] protected Guereca's life even though he was not standing on US soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Preston|first=Julia|date=30 June 2014|title=Texas: Panel Rules Agent Can Be Sued Over Shooting Teenager Across Border|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/us/texas-panel-rules-agent-can-be-sued-over-shooting-teenager-across-border.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 July 2014|title=Court: Mexican family can sue over fatal Border Patrol shooting|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/07/01/court-mexican-family-can-sue-over-fatal-border-patrol-shooting/|newspaper=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 July 2014|title=Mexican teenager killed by US Border Patrol agents had rights, court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/mexican-teenager-killed-us-border-patrol-agents-constitution|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Inskeep|first=Steve|date=9 Jun 2014|title=After Shootings, Extended Silence: What The Border Patrol Hasn't Said|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/09/320220093/foi-request-sheds-some-light-on-border-patrol-shootings|newspaper=[[NPR]]|accessdate=3 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 February 2017 |title=Supreme Court seems split over Mexican teen's shooting death by Border Patrol agent|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-seems-split-in-case-of-boys-death-near-us-mexico-border/|newspaper=[[CBS]]|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2010, U.S. helicopters entered Pakistani airspace after ground troops determined that a mortar attack by militants in Pakistan was imminent, according to the Coalition. Pakistani [[Frontier Corps]] troops manning the Mandata Kadaho border post fired warning shots, and the helicopters responded by firing two missiles that destroyed the post. Three soldiers were killed and another three wounded. Pakistan responded by closing a key NATO supply route for eleven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093000145.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Karin | last=Brulliard | title=Pakistan blocks NATO's Afghan-bound supply trucks after airstrike kills 3 | date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leander William Tomarkin''' (13 December 1895 – 1967) was a Swiss [[impostor]] who claimed to possess a doctorate in medicine, as well as to have invented a miracle medicine for the cure of [[typhus]], [[tuberculosis]], [[meningitis]], and [[malaria]]. He ascended to become the personal physician of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], king of Italy, and he convinced [[Albert Einstein]] to become patron of a conference organised by him.

==Early life==

Leander Tomarkin was born on 13 December 1895 in [[Zollikon]], Switzerland. A doctor's son, he was the black sheep of the family, obtaining bad results at school and dropping a chemistry degree at college. He also soon developed a reputation of dishonesty. He did not take up regular employment but spent his time in his father's laboratory, hoping to invent something.&lt;ref name="Dreist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/s/tb/29653/hochstapler-leander-tomarkin-der-erfinder-des-antimicrobum.html|title=Doktor Dreist|trans-title=Doctor Brazen|last=von Lüpke|first=Marc|date=1 November 2013|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomarkin rose to fame when he offered to cure [[Pope Benedict XV]]{{'s}} [[pneumonia]] in January 1922. The Pope died without Tomarkin being allowed to treat him but reporters subsequently picked up the story and enabled the progress of Tomarkin's medical career with publicising his ''Antimicrobum tomarkin'' medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomarkin was allowed to treat a cousin of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]], and the cousin recovered. As a result the king named Tomarkin the personal physician of the family. A clinical test at the [[Santo Spirito, Rome|Santo Spirito]] hospital in Rome was also successful, later attributed to the better care for test patient and the relatively early stage of pneumonia that the patients were in.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

==Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research==

In May 1924 Tomarkin emigrated to the United States, and three years later founded Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research. At this research centre he developed ''Catalysan'' and ''Disulphamin'', claiming that these medicines bring about mood changes and treat sickness in that way. The Tomarkin Foundation soon spread to Europe. Its dependency in [[Locarno]] started to organise conferences between 1930 and 1938. These conferences were set beautifully and had rich side programs and thus attracted prominent people such as surgeon [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. In 1931 [[Albert Einstein]] assumed the honorary presidency of the conference. Einstein only stayed in that position for one year, after a former landlady of Tomarkin contacted him to help retrieve debts.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

At the onset of [[World War II]] Tomarkin again emigrated to the US, due to his [[Jew]]ish ancestry. With the development of industrially manufactured [[antibiotics]] in 1939 his medical invention became obsolete. He ventured into other areas, trying to invent waterproof paint and [[synthetic diamond]]s but was unsuccessful with both. Tomarkin died in 1967.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

[[File:Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the cancelled tour]]

'''Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One''' was a planned autumn 1980 concert tour of North America by the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was scheduled to take place from 17 October through 15 November of that year and cover much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The band cancelled the tour when drummer [[John Bonham]] died on 25 September, one day after the group's initial rehearsal for the tour.

==Background==
In the wake of Led Zeppelin's turmoil-plagued [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 American tour]], which ended abruptly with the sudden death of his son Karac, singer [[Robert Plant]] had become averse to touring America with the band. His reluctance to do so persisted despite the success of the ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' album and the band's return to the stage at the [[Knebworth Festival 1979|1979 Knebworth Festival]] after a two-year absence. Following the conclusion of Led Zeppelin's successful [[Tour Over Europe 1980]], however, Plant had a change of heart and informed Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] that he was willing to undertake an American tour with the band in the autumn of 1980. According to writer [[Mick Wall]], though,

{{cquote|Plant did, however, lay down some strict deal-breaker conditions: no tour should take him away from his family for longer than a month; the band would play a maximum of two shows back-to-back followed by a day off; and, as with the European tour, Superdomes were out, more modest venues in; the aim to re-establish 'contact' with the audience (and, by definition, themselves). Grant and the others wearily complied.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had been concerned about the band's lengthy absence from one of its primary markets, and had correctly viewed the European tour as a way of rekindling Plant's interest in performing in America.  Relieved by Plant's change of heart and mindful of the singer's conditions, Grant began planning a nineteen-date tour covering the American East Coast and Midwest, and envisioned Led Zeppelin undertaking additional West Coast and UK tours in early 1981. The band began preparations for the tour with renewed optimism about Led Zeppelin's future, with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] in particular commenting that the band had "new energy"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and was "almost in a rebirth situation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; John Bonham's death, however, resulted in the scuttling of the band's touring plans, and ultimately in the demise of Led Zeppelin itself, with the breakup of the band officially announced on 4 December 1980.

While Jones's view of the state of Led Zeppelin on the eve of the 1980 North American tour was a positive one, writer [[Chris Welch]] saw things differently. In his biography of Peter Grant, Welch questioned the wisdom of the band undertaking a U.S. tour at that point in time:

{{cquote|It seems strange that Grant was quite so determined to get the band back to America, given all they had been through and the musicians' state of health. Was it just for the money? They already had an avalanche of income from record sales and publishing royalties. How many more cars, houses, farms, and antiques could they buy?&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's. He was particularly nervous about the potential backlash he might experience in the U.S. from his involvement in the backstage brawl at the Oakland Coliseum during Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 219; Welch (2009), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonham grew older, moreover, the demands of touring—along with the effects of his alcohol and drug use—took an increasing toll on his energy and stamina, and by 1980 he was struggling with fatigue. He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2009), p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; While he came across to Lewis at the time as "delighted"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for ''Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One'' that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly told Plant, "I've had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing." &lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal.

Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the concerts on this tour, the band intended to use a scaled-down approach similar to the one they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed ''In Through the Out Door'' track "[[Carouselambra]]" was included in the tentative set-list.

'''Games with concealed rules''' are [[game]]s where the [[Game#Rules|rules]] are intentionally concealed from new players, either because their discovery is part of the game itself, or because the game is a hoax and the rules do not exist. In fiction, the counterpart of the first category are games that supposedly do have a rule set, but that rule set is not disclosed.

==Actual games==

===Discovery games===
* [[Eleusis (card game)|Eleusis]]: A card game in which one player secretly decides on a rule which determines which cards may be played on top of each other. The other players then use deductive logic to work out the secret rule.
* [[Haggle (game)|Haggle]]: A party game in which the [[Gamemaster]] divides a set of cards and a subset of the full rules among players and allows them to trade for other cards and rules. 
* [[Mao (card game)|Mao]]: A [[Shedding-type game|shedding-type]] card game where the winner of a round adds a concealed rule of their choice to all subsequent rounds.
* [[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]: A [[tabletop role-playing game]] in which the rules are considered "classified". Only the [[Gamemaster]] has full knowledge of the rules, while other players must deduce them by trial and error as they proceed through the game. (The game acknowledges that players may read the gamemaster section, but ''demonstrating'' knowledge of the rules is considered treasonous, and the gamemaster may also make arbitrary changes.)
*[[Penultima]]: A chess variant in which the spectators make secret rules governing how the pieces move and capture. The two players are unaware of the rules and must discover them by inductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fryers |first1=Michael |year=1998 |title=Penultima |journal=[[Variant Chess]] |volume=3 |issue=28 |pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scissors (game)|Scissors]]: A party game in which a pair of scissors is passed between players, with the passer declaring that they are being passed "open" or "closed" based on an individual and secret rule. The other players must use observation to deduce the rule each player uses to make the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/326383402.html?dids=326383402:326383402&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+15%2C+1899&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=TWO+JOLLY+GAMES%2C |title= Two Jolly Games, A Noisy Play Imported From Peru and 'The Spider And The Fly' |date= October 15, 1899 |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hofmann |first= Mary Christina |title= Games for Everybody |publisher= Dodge Publishing |location= New York |year= 1905 |url= https://archive.org/stream/games10/games10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whose Triangle Is It?: A party game in which one player points to three people or objects, forming an imaginary triangle, and then asks "Whose triangle is it?" The triangle belongs to the person closest to the closest object of a similar color to the color of second point of the triangle, but this rule is not told to new players, and the game is for new players to figure out what the rule is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yarps.org/resources/games/mind-games/ |title= Mind Games |work= Yarps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Outbound Training |url= http://www.slideshare.net/outboundtraining/team-building-games-outbound-training |title= Team Building Games &amp; Activities |publisher= Slide Share}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]]: A game in which one player creates a rule for structures to follow and the other players try to discover the rule by building structures
* [[Snaps (game)]]: A game in which a player spells out a name using finger snapping and verbal cues.  Featured in [[P.S. I Love You (film)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Snaps|title=How to Play Snaps.|publisher=WikiHow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax or joke games===
* [[52 Pickup]]: A card game in which dealer scatters the cards on the floor and non-dealer must pick them up.
* [[Mornington Crescent (game)|Mornington Crescent]]: Originally a round in the [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/article/|publisher= BBC |title= I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue: A History |accessdate= July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of each panelist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system. The apparent aim is to be the first to announce "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern Line. Despite appearances, however, there are no rules to the game, and both the naming of stations and the specification of "rules" are based on stream-of-consciousness association and improvisation. Thus the game is intentionally incomprehensible.

==Games in works of fiction==

===Games with undisclosed rules===
* [[43-Man Squamish]]: ''MAD Magazine'' published an article outlining a college sport designed to be unplayable. The sport features a pentagonal field, silly-sounding terms and a dummy on each team.
* [[Calvinball]]: In the comic series ''[[Calvin &amp; Hobbes]]'', ''Calvinball'' is a game regularly played by the main characters. The only consistent rule of ''Calvinball'' is that "Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice".
* [[Double Fanucci]]: Featured in the computer game [[Zork Zero]], ''Double Fanucci'' has mind-bogglingly complex "rules". Legal play can depend on things like the phase of the Moon and the ancestry of the players.
* [[Dragon Poker]]: A fictional card game by [[Robert Asprin]] in the [[MythAdventures]] series. The rules change depending on weather, seating position, time of day, and other undisclosed modifiers. However, a playable version has been created by fans, based on the rules and play that are presented in the books.

===Hoax games===
* [[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|Numberwang]]: A recurring "game show" on the sketch series ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|That Mitchell and Webb Look]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC - Numberwang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/numberwang.shtml |title=BBC - Comedy - That Mitchell And Webb Site - Numberwang |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to ''Mornington Crescent'' above, the "contestants" call out random numbers in an attempt to score a "Numberwang", though the responses are scripted and there are no actual rules to winning a "Numberwang".
* Clique: The online satirical gaming magazine ''Critical Miss'' featured rules for a card game called Clique, a parody of collectible card games that used printed cards and spurious spoken rules to confuse onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue9/clique1.html|title=Clique: The Uncollectable, Unplayable Card Game|accessdate=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of games in Star Trek#Fizzbin|Fizzbin]]: In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "A Piece of the Action", [[James T. Kirk]] created this game while he and [[Spock (Star Trek)|Cmdr. Spock]] were being held prisoner. They "taught" the game to the guards, improvising the rules until their captors were sufficiently distracted, then overpowered them and escaped.

[[File:Mountjoy Prison.jpg|thumb|[[Mountjoy Prison]] where on October 31, 1973 three IRA members escaped in a hijacked helicopter.&lt;ref name="mountjoy"/&gt;]]
[[File:La-Sante-Prison-MCB.jpg|thumb|[[Prison de la Santé]] where on May 26, 1986 Michel Vaujour was flown out of the prison by his wife.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;]]

A helicopter [[prison escape]] is made when an inmate escapes from a [[prison]] by means of a [[helicopter]]. This list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility.

One of the earliest instances of using a helicopter to escape a prison was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971 from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only successfully escaped the prison but eventually escaped Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eliot Asinof| authorlink = | title = The 10-Second Jailbreak: The helicopter escape of Joel David Kaplan|edition= 1973|page= 268 | publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston; 1st edition| isbn= 0-03-001011-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France has had more recorded helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with at least 11.&lt;ref name="aiton_2005"/&gt; One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter.  Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to pluck her husband off the roof of his fortress prison. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police, and his pilot wife was arrested.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;

The record for most helicopter escapes goes to convicted murderer [[Pascal Payet]], who has used helicopters to escape from prisons in 2001, 2003, and most recently 2007.&lt;ref name="Grasse"&gt;{{cite news | date = 14 July 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6899274.stm | title = French inmate in second breakout | publisher = BBC News| accessdate = May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another multiple helicopter escapee is [[Vasilis Paleokostas]] who on February 22, 2009 escaped for the second time from the [[Korydallos Prison|same prison]].&lt;ref name="korydallos"/&gt; Because of this, many prisons have taken applicable precautions, such as nets or cables strung over open prison courtyards.&lt;ref name="Blade_1988"&gt;{{cite news |ref=harv|title= 3 Escapes caught after copter chase|first= |last=AP |authorlink=Associated Press |author2= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |format= |newspaper= [[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date= Jul 12, 1988 |page= |pages=Cover and p.7 |at= |accessdate= June 8, 2014 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |archivedate=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan Fund, was named in a 1964 Congressional investigation as a conduit for [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] money to [[Latin America]]. In 1962 he was convicted of killing his New York business partner, Louis Melchior Vidal, Jr., in [[Mexico City]].  Kaplan always maintained his innocence and on August 19, 1971, a helicopter landed in the Santa Martha Acatitla prison yard where he made his escape accompanied by Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro, a [[Venezuela]]n counterfeiter. Both men were flown to the United States and then different planes flew Kaplan to [[California]] and Castro to [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  The escape is told in a book, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"/&gt; It also inspired the 1975 movie ''[[Breakout (1975 film)|Breakout]]'', which starred [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Robert Duvall]].

Three members of the IRA were [[1973 Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape|able to escape]]: JB O'Hagan, [[Seamus Twomey]] and Kevin Mallon. Another prisoner who also was in the prison was quoted as saying, ''"One shamefaced screw apologised to the governor and said he thought it was the new Minister for Defence ([[Paddy Donegan]]) arriving. I told him it was our Minister of Defence leaving."''

The Mountjoy helicopter escape became [[Republican Movement (Ireland)|Republican lore]] and was immortalized by "[[The Helicopter Song]]", which contains the lines ''"It's up like a bird and over the city.

| Marina Paquet held a sawed off shotgun against the back of the head of a helicopter pilot. She demanded that he land in the Orsainville prison courtyard, where her boyfriend (awaiting extradition to California on a murder charge) was set to escape. The pilot, Brian Jenner, feigned a panic attack, put the helicopter through some rough maneuvers and was then able to convince Paquet, in the back seat of the Jet Ranger, to turn over her shotgun and her knife. Jenner then gave her the choice of any landing spot, except the prison. She chose to go back to the airport.

The pilot then explained, in great detail, exactly where they were and where they would be landing on arrival at the Quebec City airport. He added that the police would surely be aware by then, that she had hijacked the helicopter but would not yet be aware that she had given up her arms to the pilot. All the time Jenner was squeezing the transmit button on his cyclic stick and the tower was picking up all the details. The moment they touched down at the airport, the woman bailed from the helicopter but the police, who had been advised of the situation by the control tower, were hiding out all over the place and captured Paquet within seconds.

The plan was thwarted when [[Antony Moynihan, 3rd Baron Moynihan|Lord Tony Moynihan]], himself an exile in the Philippines, informed the [[Australian Federal Police]], who then ran it as a sting operation. Tony Moynihan would later become an informer against [[Howard Marks]] in a Florida trial.

Of the accused, only [[David McMillan (smuggler)|David McMillan]] and his accountant friend who had visited the prison stood trial. During the hearings, few prosecution witnesses used their real names as they were mostly from Moynihan’s former West African [[MI6]] unit.

They forced the pilot at gunpoint to land on the roof of the jail where they picked up the five convicts. To reach the roof the inmates cut a hole in the chain link fence. One was forced to hang onto the skids outside the helicopter as there was no room inside.

The escapees were:

*Orlando Valdes Cartagena, who was serving a 254-year sentence for murder
*Jose A. Perez Rodriguez, who was serving a 319-year sentence for murder
*Victor Gonzalez Diaz, who was serving a 113-year sentence
*Hector Marrero Diaz, who was serving 109-year sentence
*Jose M. Rojas Tapia, who was serving a 100-year sentence.

Of the five, only Victor Gonzalez Diaz wasn't recaptured immediately. The inmates claimed to have killed him soon after the break-out. He  later surrendered himself to authorities in January 2003.&lt;ref name="seattletimes_20021230"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 30, 2002|url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20021230&amp;slug=webhijack30|title = Helicopter swoops down to Puerto Rican prison, flies away with five escaping prisoners|publisher = The Seattle Times | accessdate = May 14, 2009 | last=Associated Press |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The chartered helicopter&amp;nbsp;— carrying two armed passengers, a pilot and a technician&amp;nbsp;— first tried to rip off the chicken-wire fence surrounding Trikala prison with a hook dangling from a rope. But that didn't work, so a rope was lowered down to whisk away Panagiotis Vlastos. Another prisoner, an unnamed Albanian national also in the courtyard at the time, may also have been part of the escape plan.

At the same time, the armed passengers used AK47 assault rifles and Uzi submachine gun to fire on the prison guards.  One guard, who was inside a post, was slightly injured by shards of flying glass. He and others returned fire, injuring Vlastos, who had managed to climb into the helicopter, as well as the helicopter's technician. Vlastos fell from a height of about 3 meters (10 feet) into the courtyard, and the helicopter was eventually grounded in the parking lot.

Prison officials told TV stations Mega and NET that they recovered well over 500 bullets fired from the helicopter. The Ministry of Justice, in statements describing the escape attempt, added that the helicopter passengers also carried, but did not use, "improvised explosive devices."

|Pola Roupa&lt;br /&gt;Nikos Maziotis
|A helicopter pilot foiled an attempted hijack of his apparatus by an armed woman who authorities believe wanted to use it to help convicted terrorist Nikos Maziotis escape from Korydallos prison.  
In 2013, Maziotis was convicted in absentia to 50 years in prison for setting up the now-defunct Revolutionary Struggle terrorist group, simple complicity in attempted murder, and a series of attacks claimed by group. He had been on the run since 2012 and was arrested in July 2014.
According to the anti-terrorist squad, the helicopter was leased by a woman who has since been identified by the pilot as Maziotis’ wife, Pola Roupa, at the municipality of Ermionida, in the Argolis regional unit of the Peloponnese on Sunday, and was supposed to fly to the island of Kythnos after picking up six more passengers.
Describing the incident in an announcement, anti-terror police said that the helicopter was near Athens, when the woman pulled out a gun and told the pilot to redirect the aircraft towards the city. The pilot immediately tried to disarm the woman which caused him to lose control of the helicopter and start to lose altitude. During the struggle, the woman shot at him three times without injuring him. Instead, the bullets pierced the instruments. The pilot managed to land the helicopter at an uninhabited mountainous area near the town of Thiva. The woman immediately opened the door and ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helicopter pilot foils hijack attempt, part of an escape plan for convicted terrorist|url=http://www.amna.gr/english/article/12946/Helicopter-pilot-foils-hijack-attempt--part-of-an-escape-plan-for-convicted-terrorist/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51760">This is a chronological list of conflicts in which [[peasant]]s played a significant role.

==Background==
History of peasant wars spans over a period of over two thousand years. A variety of reasons fueled the emergence of the peasant revolt phenomenon, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03066157508437962|title=The Late  Medieval Peasant Wars|author=Frantisek Graus|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=22 October 2014|doi=10.1080/03066157508437962|volume=3|journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tax resistance]] 
*[[Social inequality]] 
*[[Religious war]] 
*[[Wars of national liberation|National liberation]] 
*Resistance against [[serfdom]] 
*Redistribution of land
*External factors such as [[Black Death|plague]] and [[Great Famine of 1315-1317|famine]]

Later peasant revolts such as the [[Telangana Rebellion]] were also influenced by [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Maoism|ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/804/001/Skocpol%201979%20What%20Makes%20Peasant%20Revolutionary.pdf|title=Review: What Makes Peasants Revolutionary?|author=Theda Skocpol|date=April 1982|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peasant rebellions ended prematurely and were unsuccessful. Peasants suffered from limited funding and lacked the training and organisational capabilities of professional armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/bondeoproer/?tx_historyview_pi1[lang]=1&amp;cHash=f8911ce32f21435e54b5720e3e9db0f7|title=Peasant Rebellions|work=Danmarkshistorien-Aarhus University|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[journalism]], '''local news''' refers to coverage of events, by the [[news]], in a local context that would not be an interest of another locality, or otherwise be of national or international scope. Local news, in contrast to national or international news, caters to the news of their regional and local communities; they focus on more localized issues and events.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local Journalism and Local Media : Making the Local News|last=Franklin|first=Bob|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/aul/detail.action?docID=240326|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key features of local newsrooms includes regional politics, business, and human interest stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Kelly M.|last2=Tang|first2=Tang|date=2015-10-02|title=#SocialJournalism: Local News Media on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|journal=International Journal on Media Management|volume=17|issue=4|pages=241–257|doi=10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|issn=1424-1277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local news readership has been declining in recent years, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadbring|first=Ingela|last2=Bergström|first2=Annika|date=2017-02-01|title=A Print Crisis or a Local Crisis?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175–190|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Opt-outs of local [[television news]] are frequent before, during, or after national evening news [[television program]]ming.  Often times, television networks can also commission or make provisions for their local stations to produce a longer standalone local news programmes.  In some cases, local television markets/viewing areas within a country may even have a dedicated 24-hour local news channel. Local news stations have also started covering less and less local politics in favor of stories that they believe will garner more clicks or attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study has also shown that there has also been less investigative journalism within local news stations in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differences ===
Local news largely covers the following:
* local sports
* local crime and justice
* local weather
* local business and economy
* local events
* local education
* local politics
* local traffic updates (especially during morning newscasts)

National and international news, however, tend to cover a wider range of content, including news concerning specialized institutions of wide-ranging international power or influence, such as:
* (inter)national political and intergovernmental events
* stock markets
* (inter)national sports competitions
* regional environmental events
* media/entertainment events
* science/technology events
* air traffic/aviatory transport events
* defense/security events

=== Practices in each country ===
In the [[United States]], local news is provided on local [[commercial broadcasting]] channels (some of which are [[television network]] [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s).  They can either be standalone newscasts that run for at least a half-hour or short segments that air attached to national morning newscasts approximately 25 and 55 minutes past the hour.  As not all stations are owned and operated by a television network, the graphics, branding, and studio designs of a station's newscasts often differ from the network they are affiliated with although in recent years, affiliates have made some form of on-air reference to their corresponding networks in the branding of their newscasts.  In addition, the local news departments of stations also superimpose their on-screen digital clocks, thermometers, and (occasionally) local news tickers on graphics provided by networks during morning network newscasts.  Some cable channels are dedicated to local news coverage.  Examples of this include [[NY1]] in New York and [[NewsChannel 8 (cable channel)|NewsChannel 8]] in the Washington DC market.

In the [[United Kingdom]], most local news is provided on a local network station with similar branding and studio design to that of the national network news. Examples of this include the nationally networked [[BBC News]] and its regional news services such as [[BBC North West Tonight]] (on [[BBC North West]]) and [[BBC Newsline]] (on [[BBC Northern Ireland]]); the nationally networked [[ITV News]] and its regional stations including [[ITV Granada]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].  The long version of BBC and ITV's local news shows often air during the 18:00 hour on weekday evenings.  STV, which simulcasts most of the ITV network's programmes in Scotland, is not owned and operated by ITV but has its own branded newscast that broadcasts Scottish-centred news at the same time as ITV's regional news services.

In France, most local news is aired on France Televisions' [[France 3]].  Additionally BFM TV also has a local news channel for the Ile-de-France region called BFM Paris.

Norway's public broadcaster, [[NRK1]], airs a local news programme called NRK Distriktsnyheter (name of viewing area) every weekday evening at 18:45 Central European Time, just before the main national newscast Dagsrevyen.  A replay of all local newscasts across the country is shown on NRK2 the following morning (Tuesday to Saturday).

In Sweden, SVT's regional news is simply called SVT Nyheter (name of viewing area) which shares the same branding as the network's main newscast, Rapport.  Unlike SVT's counterparts in the US and UK, during morning programmes, the local news opt-out airs in the middle of each half-hour.  Since June 2007, the morning regional cut-ins no longer feature an in-studio presenters but instead show compiled short reports from various correspondents across the region.  When SVT World was still airing, the simulcast of the morning programme featured a different regional opt-out during each half-hour.  A 13-minute standalone local newscast airs at 18:30 Central European Time each weekday evening after Sportnytt (SVT's sport news) on SVT1.  Additionally, a short local news segment is incorporated into SVT's other evening newscast Aktuellt which airs on SVT2.  In that case, this local news segment shares the same branding and graphics as Aktuellt.  There are no local SVT newscasts on Saturdays.

==Newspapers==
A lot of newspapers specialise in covering the cities they are based in.  Although paper copies of local newspapers are usually sold and circulated exclusively in the local areas they operate (with entities such as libraries or relatives wanting a copy of the paper where a family member is mentioned being mailed copies of outside of circulation areas), companies may make digital copies of their newspapers available to interested readers directly on their website or through services such as PressReader often with a paid subscription.

In the United States, although newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have a 'national' focus on their front pages, they still have dedicated sections for news in the areas they are based in.  Weather sections also highlight conditions in the local area and the sport sections feature local teams alongside national sport stories.  Their local editions also feature local classified ads.

==Local News in the Digital Age==
In the age of digital media, local news readership has started to fall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be attributed to the younger generation's disinterest in traditional news sources and the inability of news stations to fully integrate their business models and practices into the age of digital journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While national and international news industries began using Twitter as a way to break news and interact with their audiences, local news mediums have fallen behind, trending towards using Twitter as a secondary source for spreading information rather than a primary tool for audience engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since Internet sites reach a larger audience, more local news agencies have started their own websites to compete in the digital age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Websites are a great way for local news stations to produce more interactive content, which engages the audiences and increases readership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from the Internet, Twitter specifically has become a great way to engage the younger generation in news, gain more readership, and spread information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; National news sources have started using Twitter to quickly notify the public of breaking news and to interact with their readers, but local news have failed to integrate Twitter and other forms of social media into their journalism practices as successfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While local TV news stations have actually been a bit more effective with using social media, local newspapers have overall fallen behind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By engaging the audience and spreading important information, social media has been considered a solid method for strengthening the core standards of journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, social media like Twitter has become a vital tool for news agencies to incorporate into their everyday practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a result of the transition to digital content, local news agencies have had to change their business models. Although they previously gained revenue from subscriptions, more agencies have started making money from online advertising, but this only accounts for a small portion of revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This loss in revenue has been linked to a decline in local journalistic integrity, because with less profit, the need to make money through clickbait articles has become a necessity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Image:GRB080319B illustration NASA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gamma-ray bursts might have regulated the advent of intelligent life]]
'''Neocatastrophism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that life-exterminating events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the [[Milky Way]] upon the emergence of complex [[life]] in its [[Galactic habitable zone|habitable zone]].&lt;ref name="Cirković08"&gt;Cirković MM, Vukotić B. (2008). Astrobiological phase transition: towards resolution of Fermi's paradox. 
Orig Life Evol Biosph. 38(6):535-47. {{DOI|10.1007/s11084-008-9149-y}} {{PMID|18855114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"&gt;Ćirković M.M. (2009).

[http://www.aob.bg.ac.rs/paob/86/pdf/193-196.pdf Astrobiological Landscape and Neocatastrophism.]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade,86:193-19&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed as an explanation of [[Fermi paradox|Fermi's paradox]]  since it provides a mechanism which would have delayed the otherwise expected advent of [[Noogenesis|intelligent being]]s in the local galaxy nearby to [[Earth]]. This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by [[humans]].

==The problem==

It is estimated that Earth-like [[planet]]s in the Milky Way started forming 9 billion years ago, and that their [[median]] age is 6.4 ± 0.7 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver C.H. (2001). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012399v2 An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect.] Icarus, 151:307-313 {{doi|10.1006/icar.2001.6607}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 75% of stars in the [[galactic habitable zone]] are older than the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver CH, Fenner Y, Gibson BK. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401024 The galactic habitable zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way.] Science. 303(5654):59-62. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1092322}} {{PMID|14704421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ([[Age of the Earth|4.54 Ga]]). This creates an observational dilemma since [[interstellar travel]], (even of the "slow" kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology) could in theory, if this had arisen elsewhere, take from only 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., [http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326090244/http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38-43, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] in his namesake paradox: "Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;Webb S. (2002). ''If the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody? Fifty solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life''. Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The neocatastrophism resolution==
The hypothesis posits that [[Astrobiology|astrobiological evolution]] is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology. These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the [[galactic habitable zone]]. The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts.&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt;

Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that [[stellar evolution]] produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the "window" in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age. According to modeling,&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt; this creates the possibility of a [[phase transition]] at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead (with a few pockets of simple life) to one that is crowded with complex life forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">'''New Milford''' is a fictional town in [[New Hampshire]], [[United States]]. It was the subject of a hoax article published in 2011 by ''The White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs'', which described the community as being a flourishing [[Victorian-era]] village in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] during the early 20th century. According to the article, New Milford had been incorporated in 1852 by working-class quarry workers, had enjoyed prosperity for many years, and then declined in the early 20th century, following a succession of unfortunate disasters at the quarry site, the decline of rail-based tourism, the [[Great Depression]], and the outbreak of World Wars. Research by the [[Milford, New Hampshire]], Historical Society and the New Hampshire State Library following the publication of the article led to the discovery that the article was fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cabinet.com/cabinetcabinetnews/914158-308/tale-of-milford-history.html| title=Tale of Milford History| author=Kathy Cleveland| publisher=''The Milford Cabinet''| date=March 31, 2011| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joannes septimus.jpg|thumbnail| Depiction of "Pope John VII" in [[Hartmann Schedel]]'s religious [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], published in 1493]]
'''Pope Joan''', 855–857, (''Ioannes Anglicus'') was, according to popular legend, a woman who reigned as [[pope]] for a few years during the [[Middle Ages]]. Her story first appeared in chronicles in the 13th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe. The story was widely believed for centuries, but most modern scholars regard it as fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boureau |first=  Alain|translator= Lydia G. Cochrane|year= 2001|title= The Myth of Pope Joan |publisher= University of Chicago Press |page= 8|isbn= 0226067459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |page= 8|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F. X. |date= April 2013 |title= Why Pope Joan? |journal= Catholic Historical Review|publisher= |volume= 99|issue= 2|pages= 219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguised herself as a man, often at the behest of a lover. In the most common accounts, due to her abilities, she rose through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope. Her sex was revealed when she gave birth during a procession, and she died shortly after, either through murder or natural causes. The accounts state that later church processions avoided this spot, and that the Vatican removed the female pope from its official lists and crafted a ritual to ensure that future popes were male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 1–2|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F.

[[Jean de Mailly]]'s chronicle, written around 1250, contains the first mention of an unnamed female pope, and it inspired several more accounts over the next several years. The most popular and influential version is that interpolated into [[Martin of Opava]]'s ''Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum'', later in the 13th century. Martin introduced details that the female pope's birth name was John Anglicus of [[Mainz]], that she reigned in the 9th century, and that she entered the church to follow her lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 6–7|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was generally accepted as true until the 16th century, when a widespread debate among Catholic and Protestant writers called the story into question; various writers noted the implausibly long gap between Joan's supposed lifetime and her first appearance in texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |page= 14|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F.

==Legend==
The earliest mention of a female pope appears in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Jean de Mailly]]'s chronicle of [[Metz]], ''Chronica Universalis Mettensis'', written in the early 13th century. In his telling, the female pope is not named, and the events are set in 1099. According to Jean:

{{quote|Query: Concerning a certain Pope or rather female Pope, who is not set down in the [[list of popes]] or Bishops of Rome, because she was a woman who disguised herself as a man and became, by her character and talents, a curial secretary, then a Cardinal and finally Pope. One day, while mounting a horse, she gave birth to a child. Immediately, by Roman justice she was bound by the feet to a horse's tail and dragged and stoned by the people for half a league, and, where she died, there she was buried, and at the place is written: "Petre, Pater Patrum, Papisse Prodito Partum" [Oh Peter, Father of Fathers, Betray the childbearing of the woman Pope]. At the same time, the four-day fast called the "fast of the female Pope" was first established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breverton|first=Terry|authorlink=Terry Breverton|title=Breverton's Phantasmagoria: A Compendium of Monsters, Myths and Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2n5YdVTW0z8C&amp;pg=PT81|year=2011|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-0762770236|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Jean de Mailly|Chronica Universalis Mettensis}}

Jean de Mailly's story was picked up by his fellow Dominican [[Stephen of Bourbon]], who adapted it for his work on the ''Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost''. However, the legend gained its greatest prominence when it appeared in the third ''recension'' (edited revision) of [[Martin of Opava]]'s ''Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum'' later in the 13th century. This version, which may have been by Martin himself, is the first to attach a name to the figure, indicating that she was known as "John Anglicus" or "John of Mainz." It also changes the date from the 11th to the 9th century, indicating that Joan reigned between [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] and [[Pope Benedict III|Benedict III]] in the 850s. According to the ''Chronicon'':

{{quote|John Anglicus, born at Mainz, was Pope for two years, seven months and four days, and died in Rome, after which there was a [[Sede vacante|vacancy in the Papacy]] of one month. It is claimed that this John was a woman, who as a girl had been led to Athens dressed in the clothes of a man by a certain lover of hers. There she became proficient in a diversity of branches of knowledge, until she had no equal, and, afterward in Rome, she taught the liberal arts and had great masters among her students and audience. A high opinion of her life and learning arose in the city; and she was chosen for Pope. While Pope, however, she became pregnant by her companion. Through ignorance of the exact time when the birth was expected, she was delivered of a child while in procession from [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] to the [[Lateran]], in a lane once named Via Sacra (the sacred way) but now known as the "shunned street" between the [[Colosseum]] and [[Basilica of San Clemente|St Clement's church]]. After her death, it is said she was buried in that same place. The Lord Pope always turns aside from the street, and it is believed by many that this is done because of abhorrence of the event. Nor is she placed on the list of the Holy Pontiffs, both because of her female sex and on account of the foulness of the matter.|Martin of Opava|Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum}}

One version of the ''Chronicon'' gives an alternative fate for the female pope. According to this, she did not die immediately after her exposure, but was confined and deposed, after which she did many years of penance. Her son from the affair eventually became [[Bishop of Ostia]], and ordered her entombment in his cathedral when she died.

Other references to the female pope are attributed to earlier writers, though none appears in manuscripts that predate the ''Chronicon''. The one most commonly cited is [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]] (d. 886), a compiler of ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', who was a contemporary of the female Pope by the ''Chronicon'''s dating. However, the story is found in only one unreliable manuscript of Anastasius. This manuscript, in the [[Vatican Library]], bears the relevant passage inserted as a footnote at the bottom of a page. It is out of sequence, and in a different hand, one that dates from after the time of Martin of Opava. This "witness" to the female pope is likely to be based upon Martin's account, and not a possible source for it. The same is true of [[Marianus Scotus]]'s ''Chronicle of the Popes'', a text written in the 11th century. Some of its manuscripts contain a brief mention of a female pope named Johanna (the earliest source to attach to her the female form of the name), but all these manuscripts are later than Martin's work. Earlier manuscripts do not contain the legend.

Some versions of the legend suggest that subsequent popes were subjected to an examination whereby, having sat on a so-called ''sedia stercoraria'' or "dung chair" containing a hole, a cardinal had to reach up and establish that the new pope had [[testicle]]s, before announcing "''Duos habet et bene pendentes''" ("He has two, and they dangle nicely"),&lt;ref name="Clément1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clément|first=Catherine|title=Opera: The Undoing of Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dc4HeHS3ulMC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1999|publisher=U of Minnesota P|isbn=978-0-8166-3526-9|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''habet''" ("he has them") for short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leroy|first=Fernand|title=Histoire de naître: de l'enfantement primitif à l'accouchement médicalisé|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aqgvIsStVsC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2001|publisher=De Boeck Supérieur|isbn=978-2-8041-3817-2|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were associated legends as well. In the 1290s, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Robert of Uzès]] recounted a vision in which he saw the seat "where, it is said, the pope is proved to be a man". Pope Joan has been associated with marvelous happenings. [[Petrarch]] (1304&amp;ndash;74) wrote in his ''Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani'' that after Pope Joan had been revealed as a woman:

{{quote|... in Brescia it rained blood for three days and nights. In France there appeared marvelous locusts, which had six wings and very powerful teeth. They flew miraculously through the air, and all drowned in the British Sea. The golden bodies were rejected by the waves of the sea and corrupted the air, so that a great many people died.|Petrarch|Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani}}

However, the attribution of this work to Petrarch may be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronica delle vite de pontefici et imperatori romani|url=http://www.franklin.library.upenn.edu/record.html?id=FRANKLIN_3544172|website=Franklin: Penn Libraries Catalog|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=24 January 2015|quote=The attribution to Petrarch is doubtful.

==Later development==
[[Image:La Papessa.jpg|thumb|upright|An untitled [[The High Priestess|popess]] on the ''Rosenwald Sheet'' of uncut [[Tarot]] woodcuts. Early 16th-century. Now in [[National Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] ]]
From the mid-13th century onward, the legend was widely disseminated and believed. Joan was used as an ''[[exemplum]]'' in [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preaching. [[Bartolomeo Platina]], the scholar who was prefect of the Vatican Library, wrote his ''Vitæ Pontificum Platinæ historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX'' in 1479 at the behest of his patron, [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The book contains the following account of the female Pope:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pope John VIII: John, of English extraction, was born at Mentz ([[Mainz]]) and is said to have arrived at popedom by evil art; for disguising herself like a man, whereas she was a woman, she went when young with her paramour, a learned man, to Athens, and made such progress in learning under the professors there that, coming to Rome, she met with few that could equal, much less go beyond her, even in the knowledge of the scriptures; and by her learned and ingenious readings and disputations, she acquired so great respect and authority that upon the death of [[Pope Leo IV]] (as Martin says) by common consent she was chosen pope in his room. As she was going to the Lateran Church between the [[Colosseum|Colossean Theatre]] (so called from [[Nero]]'s Colossus) and St. Clement's her travail came upon her, and she died upon the place, having sat two years, one month, and four days, and was buried there without any pomp. This story is vulgarly told, but by very uncertain and obscure authors, and therefore I have related it barely and in short, lest I should seem obstinate and pertinacious if I had admitted what is so generally talked. I had better mistake with the rest of the world, though it be certain, that what I have related may be thought not altogether incredible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Woodcut illustration of Pope Joan - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pope Joan giving birth. Woodcut from a German translation by Heinrich Steinhöwel of Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', printed by Johannes Zainer at Ulm ca. 1474 ([[British Museum]])]]
References to the female Pope abound in the later [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]]. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] wrote about her in ''[[De mulieribus claris|De Mulieribus Claris]]'' (1353).&lt;ref&gt;Ch. 99: "De Ioannae Anglica Papa;" it begins succinctly "Ioannes esto Vir nomine videbature, sexu tamen fœmina fuit."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adam of Usk]] (1404) gives her a name, Agnes, and furthermore mentions a statue in Rome that is said to be of her. This statue had never been mentioned by any earlier writer anywhere; presumably it was an actual statue that came to be taken to be of the female pope. A late-14th-century edition of the ''Mirabilia Urbis Romae'', a guidebook for pilgrims to Rome, tells readers that the female Pope's remains are buried at St. Peter's. It was around this time that a long series of busts of past Popes was made for the [[Siena Cathedral|Duomo of Siena]], which included one of the female pope, named as "Johannes VIII, Foemina de Anglia" and included between Leo IV and Benedict III.

At his trial in 1415, [[Jan Hus]] argued that the Church does not necessarily need a pope, because, during the pontificate of "Pope Agnes" (as he also called her), it got on quite well. Hus's opponents at this trial insisted that his argument proved no such thing about the independence of the Church, but they did not dispute that there had been a female pope at all.

==During the Reformation==
In 1587, [[Florimond de Raemond]], a magistrate in the [[parlement]] de Bordeaux and an [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], published his first attempt to deconstruct the legend, ''Erreur Populaire de la Papesse Jeanne'' (also subsequently published under the title ''L'Anti-Papesse''). The tract applied humanist techniques of textual criticism to the Pope Joan legend, with the broader intent of supplying sound historical principles to ecclesiastical history, and the legend began to come apart, detail by detail. Raemond's ''Erreur Populaire'' went through successive editions, reaching a fifteenth as late as 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tinsley | first = Barbara Sher |date=Autumn 1987 | title = Pope Joan Polemic in Early Modern France: The Use and Disabuse of Myth | journal = Sixteenth Century Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–98 | issn = 0361-0160 | doi=10.2307/2540724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1601, [[Pope Clement VIII]] declared the legend of the female pope to be untrue. The famous bust of her, inscribed ''Johannes VIII, Femina ex Anglia,'' which had been carved for the series of papal figures in the [[Siena Cathedral|Duomo di Siena]] about 1400 and was noted by travelers, was either destroyed or recarved and relabeled, replaced by a male figure, that of [[Pope Zachary]].&lt;ref name="ShePope"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stanford | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Stanford | title = The She-Pope: a quest for the truth behind the mystery of Pope Joan | year = 1999 | publisher = Arrow | isbn = 978-0-7493-2067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of Pope Joan was "effectively demolished" by [[David Blondel]], a mid-17th century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] historian, who suggested that Pope Joan's tale may have originated in a satire against [[Pope John XI]], who died in his early 20s.&lt;ref name="ODP"/&gt; Blondel, through detailed analysis of the claims and suggested timings, argued that no such events could have happened.&lt;ref name="ODP"/&gt;

The 16th-century Italian historian [[Onofrio Panvinio]], commenting on one of [[Bartolomeo Platina]]'s works that refer to Pope Joan, theorized that the story of Pope Joan may have originated from tales of [[Pope John XII]]; John reportedly had many mistresses, including one called Joan, who was very influential in Rome during his pontificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 4|last= McClintock |first= John |author2=James Strong |year= 1882 |publisher= Harper|location= |isbn= |page= 980|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lX4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA980&amp;lpg=PA980#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  Biography: or, Third division of "The English encyclopedia"|last= Knight |first= Charles |year= 1867|publisher= Bradbury, Evans &amp; Co.|location= |isbn= |page= 633|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0MNPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT218&amp;lpg=RA1-PT218&amp;dq=pope+Joan&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Reformation]], various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers took up the Pope Joan legend in their anti-Catholic writings, and the Catholics responded with their own polemic.  According to [[Pierre Gustave Brunet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/lapapessejeanne01brungoog|title=La Papesse Jeanne: Étude Historique et Littéraire|author=Pierre Gustave Brunet|editor=Gay|editor2=Doucé|location=Brussels|year=1880|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Various authors, in the 16th and 17th centuries, occupied themselves with Pope Joan, but it was from the point of view of the polemic engaged in between the partisans of Lutheran or Calvinist reform and the apologists of Catholicism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An English writer, Alexander Cooke, wrote a book entitled ''Pope Joane: A Dialogue between a Protestant and a Papist'', which purported to prove the existence of Pope Joan by reference to Catholic traditions.&lt;ref name=Rustici&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuuJCOq0mSMC&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England|last1=Rustici |first1=Craig M.|publisher=University of Michigan Press|date=2006|page=43|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was republished in 1675 as ''A Present for a Papist: Or the Life and Death of Pope Joan, Plainly Proving Out of the Printed Copies, and Manscriptes of Popish Writers and Others, That a Woman called Joan, Was Really Pope of Rome, and Was There Deliver'd of a Bastard Son in the Open Street as She Went in Solemn Procession''.&lt;ref name=Rustici/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A present for a papist: or, The history of the life of pope Joan|date=1740|publisher=Olive Payne|location=Cornhill, London|pages=1–88|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJgHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book gives an account of Pope Joan giving birth to a son in plain view of all those around, accompanied by a detailed engraving showing a rather surprised looking baby peeking out from under the Pope's robes. Even in the 19th century, authors such as Ewaldus Kist and [[Karl Hase]] discussed the story as a real occurrence. However, other Protestant writers, such as [[David Blondel]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], rejected the story.

==Modern analysis and critique==
[[File:Bonifacio Bembo.jpg|thumbnail|The [[The High Priestess|Popess tarot card]] from the [[Visconti-Sforza]] tarot deck, c. 1450]]

Most modern scholars dismiss Pope Joan as a medieval [[legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/pope.htm | title = The lady was a pope: A bestseller revives the outlandish tale of Joan | first = Lewis | last = Lord | date = 24 July 2000 | work = U.S. News Online | publisher = [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5oQsXy9eD?url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/pope.htm | archivedate = 23 March 2010 | accessdate = 2010-03-22 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Britain's preeminent historians dismisses the myth with a logical assessment of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, John Julius. Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy. 2011. ‘Pope Joan’ Chapter VI, pp. 63–70. {{ISBN|978-0-679-60499-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford Dictionary of Popes''&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kelly | first = J.N.D. | title = Oxford Dictionary of Popes | year = 2005 | origyear = 1988 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=0-19-861433-0 | pages=331–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; declares that there is "no contemporary evidence for a female Pope at any of the dates suggested for her reign", but nonetheless acknowledges that Pope Joan's legend was widely believed for centuries, even by Catholics.

The 1910 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' elaborated on the historical timeline problem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Between Leo IV and Benedict III, where Martinus Polonus places her, she cannot be inserted, because Leo IV died 17 July 855, and immediately after his death Benedict III was elected by the clergy and people of Rome; but, owing to the setting up of an [[Antipope]], in the person of the deposed Cardinal Anastasius, he was not consecrated until 29 September. Coins exist which bear both the image of Benedict III and of Emperor [[Lothair I|Lothair]], who died 28 September 855; therefore Benedict must have been recognized as pope before the last-mentioned date. On 7 October 855, Benedict III issued a charter for the Abbey of Corvey. [[Hincmar]], Archbishop of Reims, informed Nicholas I that a messenger whom he had sent to Leo IV learned on his way of the death of this Pope, and therefore handed his petition to Benedict III, who decided it (Hincmar, ep. xl in P.L., CXXXVI, 85). All these witnesses prove the correctness of the dates given in the lives of Leo IV and Benedict III, and there was no [[interregnum]] between these two Popes, so that at this place there is no room for the alleged Popess.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08407a.htm | title = Popess Joan | first = J.P. | last = Kirsch | year = 1910| work = The Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | location = New York | accessdate = 2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has also been noted that enemies of the papacy in the 9th century make no mention of a female pope. For example, [[Photios I of Constantinople]], who became [[Patriarch]] in 858 and was deposed by [[Pope Nicholas I]] in 863, was an enemy of the pope. He vehemently asserted his own authority as patriarch over that of the pope in Rome, and would have made the most of any scandal of that time regarding the papacy; but he never mentions the story once in any of his voluminous writings. Indeed, at one point he mentions "Leo and Benedict, successively great priests of the Roman Church".&lt;ref name="pardoe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pardoe | first = Rosemary and Darroll | title = The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan.

Rosemary and Darroll Pardoe, authors of ''The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan'', theorize that if a female pope did exist, a more plausible time frame is 1086 and 1108, when there were several antipopes; during this time the reign of the legitimate popes [[Pope Victor III|Victor III]], [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], and [[Pope Paschal II|Paschal II]] was not always established in [[Rome]], since the city was occupied by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and later sacked by the [[Normans]].&lt;ref name="pardoe"/&gt; This also agrees with the earliest known version of the legend, by [[Jean de Mailly]], as he places the story in the year 1099. De Mailly's "account" was acknowledged by his companion [[Stephen of Bourbon]].

[[Peter Stanford]], a British writer and former editor of ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'', concluded in ''The Legend of Pope Joan: In Search of the Truth'' (2000) "Weighing all th[e] evidence, I am convinced that Pope Joan was an historical figure, though perhaps not all the details about her that have been passed on down the centuries are true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legend of Pope Joan|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8050-3910-8|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanford's work has been criticised as "credulous" by one mainstream historian.&lt;ref&gt;"The Medieval Popes", by Vincent DeMarco, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=oneTAgAAQBAJ ''Misconceptions about the Middle Ages''] ed. Stephen Harris, Bryon L. Grigsby; [[Routledge]], 18 Feb 2008, p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=oneTAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=peter%20stanford%20pope%20joan&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 68]&lt;/ref&gt;
Against the lack of historical evidence to her existence, the question remains as to why the Pope Joan story has been popular and widely believed. [[Philip Jenkins]] in ''[[The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice]]'' suggests that the periodic revival of what he calls this "anti-papal legend" has more to do with [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] wishful thinking than historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Philip | authorlink = Philip Jenkins | title = The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = 17 April 2003 | page = 89 | isbn = 0-19-515480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sede stercoraria'', the throne with a hole in the seat, now at [[St. John Lateran]] (the formal residence of the popes and center of Catholicism), is to be considered. This and other toilet-like chairs were used in the consecration of [[Pope Pascal II]] in 1099.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boureau|first1=Alain|title=La Papesse Jeanne|date=1988|publisher=Aubier|location=Paris|page=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one is still in the [[Vatican Museums]], another at the [[Musée du Louvre]]. The reason for the configuration of the chair is disputed. It has been speculated that they originally were Roman [[bidet]]s or imperial birthing stools, which because of their age and imperial links were used in ceremonies by Popes intent on highlighting their own imperial claims (as they did also with their [[Latin]] title, ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'').&lt;ref name="Norwich 2011 63"/&gt;

Alain Boureau quotes the humanist Jacopo d'Angelo de Scarparia, who visited Rome in 1406 for the enthronement of [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]]. The pope sat briefly on two "pierced chairs" at the Lateran: "... the vulgar tell the insane fable that he is touched to verify that he is indeed a man", a sign that this corollary of the Pope Joan legend was still current in the Roman street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boureau|first1=Alain|title=La Papesse Jeanne|date=1988|publisher=Aubier|location=Paris|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval popes, from the 13th century onward, did indeed avoid the direct route between the Lateran and St Peter's, as Martin of Opava claimed. However, there is no evidence that this practice dated back any earlier. The origin of the practice is uncertain, but it is quite likely that it was maintained because of widespread belief in the Joan legend, and it was thought genuinely to date back to that period.

Although some medieval writers referred to the female pope as "John VIII", a genuine [[Pope John VIII]] reigned between 872 and 882. Due to the Dark Ages' lack of records, confusion often reigns in the evaluation of events.

A problem sometimes connected to the Pope Joan legend is the fact that there is no [[Pope John XX]] in any list. It is said this reflects a renumbering of the popes to exclude Joan from history. Historians have known since [[Louis Duchesne]]'s critical edition of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' that the "renumbering" was actually due to a misunderstanding in the textual transmission of the official papal lists. In the course of the 11th century, in the time after [[Pope John XIX|John XIX]], the entry for [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] had been misread as referring to two different popes of this name. These two popes then came to be distinguished as ''Iohannes XIV'' and ''Iohannes XIV bis'' ("John XIV the second").

The existence of a second Pope John XIV was widely accepted in the 13th century, hence the numbering of Popes John XV through XIX was regarded as being erroneous. When Petrus Hispanus was elected pope in 1276 and chose the papal name John, he decided to correct this error by skipping the number XX. He numbered himself [[Pope John XXI|John XXI]], thus acknowledging the presumed existence of John XIV "bis" in the 10th century.

In 2018, an analysis of several silver coins from the 850s A.D, done by researchers from [[Flinders University]] indicated that they were inscribed with the name Johannes Anglicus. From the dating of the 850s, when there were missing papal records, led the researchers to believe the legend was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/female-pope-0010644|title= Researchers Find Physical Evidence for the Existence of a Female Pope|last= Whelan|first= Ed|date= 3 September 2018|website= www.ancient-origins.net|publisher= Ancient Origins|access-date= 24 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.livescience.com/63598-female-pope-joan-medieval-coins.html|title= Legends of a Medieval Female Pope May Tell the Truth|last= Choi|first= Charles Q.|date= 16 September 2018|website= www.livescience.com|publisher= Purch|access-date= 24 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Pope Joan has remained a popular subject for fictional works. Plays include [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]'s ''Päpstin Johanna'' (1813), a fragment by [[Bertolt Brecht]] (in ''Werke''. Bd. 10), and a [[monodrama]], ''Pausin Johanna'' by Cees van der Pluijm (1996).

The Greek author [[Emmanuel Rhoides]]' 1866 novel, ''The Papess Joanne'', was admired by [[Mark Twain]] and [[Alfred Jarry]] and freely translated by [[Lawrence Durrell]] as ''The Curious History of Pope Joan'' (1954). The American [[Donna Woolfolk Cross]]'s 1996 [[historical romance]], ''[[Pope Joan (novel)|Pope Joan]]'', was recently made into a German musical as well as the movie described below. Other novels include Wilhelm Smets's ''Das Mährchen von der Päpstin Johanna auf’s Neue erörtert'' (1829), [[Marjorie Bowen]]'s ''Black Magic'' (1909), Ludwig Gorm's ''Päpstin Johanna'' (1912),  Yves Bichet's ''La Papesse Jeanne'' (2005), and Hugo N. Gerstl's ''Scribe: The Story of the Only Female Pope'' (2005).

There have been two films based on the story of Pope Joan: ''[[Pope Joan (1972 film)|Pope Joan]]'' (1972), directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]], was titled ''The Devil's Imposter'' in the US. In 2009, it was recut to include more of [[John Briley]]'s original script and released as ''She... who would be Pope''. Also in 2009, another film with the title ''[[Pope Joan (2009 film)|Pope Joan]]'' was released, this one a German, British, Italian and Spanish production directed by [[Sönke Wortmann]] and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]], based on Cross's novel.

The play ''[[Top Girls]]'' by [[Caryl Churchill]] featured Pope Joan as a character, who was invited to a restaurant along with other historically important women in the past by a modern-day woman, Marlene, to discuss the restriction of [[feminism]] in the past.

Pope Joan is referenced in the video game ''[[Persona 5]]'', as the inspiration for Johanna, one of the titular personas (cognitive beings used by humans to battle demons) belonging to Makoto Niijima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Persona® 5|url=http://atlus.com/persona5/characters-makoto.html|website=atlus.com|publisher=ATLUS|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rene Peter Onno Rubiono van Helsdingen''' (born 25 February 1957)&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC"&gt;{{cite web|last = Helsdingen|first = Rene|url = http://www.renevanhelsdingen.com/biography.html|title = Rene van Helsdingen biography|publisher = |date = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch pianist and composer. 

He studied classical music with Komter Loeber in [[Blaricum]] in the Netherlands from 1962–72. Then he studied jazz music with [[Terry Trotter]] and Lazlo Cser in Los Angeles in 1979. His earliest influences include [[Oscar Peterson]], [[McCoy Tyner]] and [[Bill Evans]]. 

Over the years pianist René has recorded and produced for many different labels, such as Virgin, Timeless, WEA, Dureco,  Zebra Acoustic, Pacific Music, Turning Point records, Munich Records, demajors Independent Music Industry Jakarta and his own labels: Relukreul records, and Helsdingen Music, The Netherlands. Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterised him as "A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity. René allows himself a few extended workouts and avoids the trap of repeating himself or overstating his case."&lt;ref&gt;The Age, Melbourne, 23 Dec. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Helsdingen has organized many successful tours, projects and festivals sponsored by ngo’s , governmental institutions, companies to which he was responsible with regard to the control over the budgets made available.

[[File:RidersOfJudgment.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Random House]])]]
'''''Riders of Judgment''''' is the fifth book chronologically in [[Frederick Manfred]]'s ''[[The Buckskin Man Tales]]'', which trace themes through five novels set in the 19th Century Great Plains. The story fictionalizes [[Wyoming]]'s [[Johnson County War]], based on Manfred's original research (which relied heavily on Johnson County Historian Thelma Condit). His analysis of events is close to the story as recounted in Helena Huntington Smith's ''The War on Powder River'',&lt;ref name="HHS01" /&gt; which was published about ten years after Manfred's novel.

The novel was the source for the made-for-television film ''The Johnson County War,'' starring Tom Berenger. Manfred's novelization uses Nate Champion, Jack Flagg, and John Tisdale as the models for his Hammett brothers, Cain, Harry, and Dale, and turns Frank Canton into a strange family nemesis called variously Hunt Lawton and Link Keeler. Manfred changes the names of the county and the nearby towns.

'''Sustainable event management''' (also known as '''event greening''') is the process used to produce an [[wikt:event|event]] with particular concern for environmental, economic and social issues. [[Sustainability]] in event management incorporates socially and [[environmentally responsible]] decision making into the planning, organisation and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organisation, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organisers, venues, sub-contractors and suppliers.

== History ==
The first time that environmental concerns were raised by the public was at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville Winter Olympics]] in France, which led to the first ‘green Games’ in [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer, Norway]], in 1994. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee received the [http://www.unep.org/sport_env/about.aspx UNEP Global 500 Award] for setting environmental standards which were absent from previous Olympic games.

The Centennial Olympic Congress, Congress of Unity, held in Paris in 1994, recognised the importance of the environment and sustainable development, which led to the inclusion of a paragraph in Rule 2 of the Olympic Charter. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) has acknowledged its particular responsibility in terms of promoting sustainable development, and regards the environment as the third dimension of Olympism, alongside sport and culture. This led to its decision in 1995 to create an [http://www.olympic.org/sport-environment-commission IOC Sport and Environment Commission].&lt;ref&gt;International Olympic Committee, Sport and Environment Commission, http://www.olympic.org/sport-environment-commission&lt;/ref&gt; 

Environmental Guidelines for the Summer Olympics were developed to guide Olympic hosts to ensure that facilities are constructed in a more environmentally friendly manner. The Guidelines were successfully used in the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. As a result, the organizers of the Sydney Games were honoured with the Global 500 Award in 2001 for organizing the greenest games ever. Since then, other major sports events have also considered their environmental impact. 

A major aspect of [http://www.unep.org/sport_env/ UNEP]’s work is with the IOC. A cooperative agreement was signed in 1994 with IOC and an Agenda 21 for Sport and Environment developed. Since 2002, UNEP has participated in a task force of the UN Secretary-General on the use of sport for the implementation of the United Nations Development Goals.  UNEP also supports the IOC in organizing world conferences and regional seminars on sport and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, Sport and Environment, http://www.unep.org/sport_env/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006 FIFA World CupTM in Germany, Green Goal was launched, which was also implemented in South Africa for the 2010 FIFA World CupTM.  The Host City [https://web.archive.org/web/20100608185533/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/greengoal/Pages/default.aspx Cape Town Green Goal] programme had been awarded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Sport and Environment Award. Nominated by [https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/news/newsid=1476740/index.html FIFA], the award recognised the efforts of the Host City [[Cape Town]] to mitigate negative environmental impacts of the FIFA World Cup and to maximise a positive environmental and social legacy.&lt;ref&gt;City of Cape Town, Green Goal Programme, {{cite web |url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/GreenGoal/Pages/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608185533/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/greengoal/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Event greening is however not only limited to sports events, and other examples include the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD), [[Johannesburg]] 2002, and [[COP15|UNFCCC 15th Conference of the Parties]] (COP15) held in [[Copenhagen]] in 2010.



==Monitoring and evaluation ==
[[Monitoring and Evaluation|Monitoring and evaluation]] is an essential component of event greening, and should be used to make continuous improvement. A detailed plan needs to be in place to ensure that information is gathered on all aspects of the event – before, during, and also after the event. This ensures that information is available to understand the effects of greening interventions (e.g. to what extent was water used, and how did water-saving measures reduce water use), as well as the potential improvements to future event-greening initiatives.

With large events it is best to ensure an independent report, which complies with international standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/sector-guidance/event-organizers/Pages/default.as&lt;/ref&gt; The GRI Event Organizers Supplement provides organizations in the sector with a tailored version of GRI’s Reporting Guidelines. It includes the original Guidelines, which set out the Reporting Principles, Disclosures on Management Approach and Performance Indicators for economic, environmental and social issues. The Event Organizers Supplement’s capture the issues that matter most for event organizers to be reported on:
* Site selection
* Transport of attendees
* Recruiting and training of the event workforce, participants and volunteers
* Sourcing of materials, supplies and services
* Managing impacts on communities, natural environments, and local and global economies.
* Planning and managing potential legacies
* Accessibility of an event

The British Standard ([http://www.bsigroup.co.uk/en/Assessment-and-Certification-services/Management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/BS-8901/ BS 8901]) has been developed specifically for the events industry with a purpose of helping the industry to operate in a more sustainable manner. The standard defines the requirements for a sustainability event management system to ensure an enduring and balanced approach to economic activity, environmental responsibility and social progress relating to events.

It requires organizations to identify and understand the effects that their activities have on the environment, on society and on the economy both within the organization and the wider economy; and put measures in place to minimize the negative effects.  These standards will however be replaced by the International Standard ([http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1281 ISO 20121]) for Sustainability Management Systems.

'''The Poppy Fields''' were a fictitious teenage group, invented by the [[Wales|Welsh]] rock band, [[The Alarm]]. The Poppy Fields scored a hit with the release of "[[45 RPM (song)|45 RPM]]" that would become The Alarm's first hit in over a decade. [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] revealed the truth on live radio as [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] was conducting a 2004 broadcast of their then current chart countdown. The story was highlighted by international news outlets with several headlines being published globally.

Immediately after exposing the hoax, the music video for "45 RPM" was replaced by an edited version that included The Alarm's members alongside the hyped members of The Poppy Fields.&lt;ref name="mnews" /&gt; Peters had enticed a young band called the Wayriders to lip-sync the song for the music video while posing as members of the nonexistent group.&lt;ref name="amusic" /&gt; The events surrounding this hoax have spawned the cinematic release of ''[[Vinyl (2012 film)|Vinyl]]'', its soundtrack, The Alarm ''Vinyl Tour 2013'', and the subsequent announcement of a 2013 tour by The Alarm in support of the soundtrack.&lt;ref name="mnews" /&gt;

== Hoax ==

In an interview with [[BBC News]] Online, [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] said "[[The Alarm]], most famous for their 1983 hit '[[68 Guns]]', were not always taken seriously by DJs" because of a combination of the age of the band's members and a perception that their image was outdated. Peters said, "The Alarm as an entity have been going for 20-odd years and history can go against you &amp;ndash; we wanted to break the barrier down." He continued by saying that "[The Alarm members] wanted to stir up the water a little bit, break the mould" and have the song judged on its own merits and musical value, instead of judgement being based on the perception of the band.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; Peters told ''[[The Guardian]]'': "We noticed that a lot of bands suffer when they attempt comebacks because people generally don't believe they can ever be as good as they once were. We wanted to make sure we are judged purely on the strength of the music, and not by our old hairstyles."&lt;ref name="BBCNewsWales" /&gt;

=== The Poppy Fields ===

With The Alarm's decision to perpetrate the hoax, Mike Peters gained the cooperation of a group of young musicians from [[Chester]] called the Wayriders&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; to lip-sync The Alarm's material and pass it off as their own. The first release by the fictitious band was promoted as a cover of The Alarm's 1983 hit, "[[68 Guns]]".&lt;ref name="encofpm" /&gt; In fact it was The Alarm all along, and instead of a cover, it was a re-released version. The demo enticed executives in music production to record an album from the band called ''In The Poppy Fields'' which saw its advance release of the single, "45 RPM" entering Britain's top 30 chart. Critical reviews of the band echoed the promoters' official introduction of the band as a tribute to bands like [[Sex Pistols]], and [[The Clash]], with even more modern acts like [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] being compared.&lt;ref name="musicomh" /&gt; The truth of the song's origin was not revealed until after the song entered the charts at number 24,&lt;ref name="BBCNews2" /&gt; a credit originally earned by The Poppy Fields from unsuspecting patrons who had accepted the act as fresh and new.&lt;ref name="11-30" /&gt;

== ''Vinyl'' ==

Filming for ''[[Vinyl (2012 film)|Vinyl]]'' began in the [[Denbighshire]] resort town of [[Rhyl]] in August 2010.&lt;ref name="BBCNews2" /&gt; ''Vinyl''{{'}}s soundtrack features new songs by [[The Alarm]] specifically composed for the film including the cinematic anthem, "Free Rock And Roll", recorded by The Alarm with ''Vinyl''{{'}}s leading actor, [[Phil Daniels]],&lt;ref name="BBCNews3" /&gt; in a song with The Alarm's lead vocalist and founding member, Mike Peters. The song was released as an EP single on 28 January 2013 in tandem with a national television campaign featuring both the film's cast and members of The Alarm.&lt;ref name="alarm" /&gt;

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 – ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 – ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 – ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 – ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.

'''''You Me Bum Bum Train''''' is an [[Interactive theatre]] performance devised by Kate Bond and Morgan Lloyd in 2004. The pair met as art students in Brighton, where they were studying illustration and film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/you-me-bum-bum-train-all-aboard-for-the-ride-of-a-lifetime-a2473106.html ''Evening Standard'' interview, 11 August 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''You Me Bum Bum Train'' gained critical acclaim in the United Kingdom when it was awarded the [[Samuel Beckett Award|Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |title=Barbican announces Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust award-winner|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730232240/http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/theatredance/you-me-bum-bum-train |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while showing in a disused office in London. In 2010 it won the [[Evening Standard Theatre Award]] for outstanding newcomer. 

It returned in 2012 in a former postal depot in [[Holborn]], and a new version of the show – at Empire House in Stratford, east London in 2012 – was nominated for an [[Olivier Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |title=Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre - Olivier Awards|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402194001/http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item137190/outstanding-achievement-in-an-affiliate-theatre/ |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the show was mounted again, this time in at what had been [[Foyles]] bookshop on London's [[Charing Cross Road]] where their last show, started on 25 February 2016, finished on 29 April.

==Overview==
Visitors to the performance pass through a series of scenes of which they have no foreknowledge, in which they are either passive or where they must improvise a part without any preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Dickson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/11/best-theatre-2012-you-me-bum |title=Best theatre of 2012, No 9: You Me Bum Bum Train &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna Hanra, writing for ''Vice'', described it as a series of "highly detailed, absurd real life scenarios following one another on a nonsense high-paced narrative".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/you-me-bum-bum-train-378 ''Vice'' interview, 19 June 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The entertainment magazine ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' reported; "What was one of London's more obtuse treasures is set to become one of Great Britain's proudest moments." ''[[The Times]]'' said; "It leaves you questioning everything, and it's lots of fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/style/article1480556.ece|title=Album review|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] magazine wrote; "My highlight of 2008 was You Me Bum Bum Train, if only real life were that interesting."

==Controversies==
''You Me Bum Bum Train'' has provoked controversy due to the fact that none of the performers gets paid, though the directors stress that performers and crew are involved on a voluntary basis, that many are not trained professionals and that they are under no obligation to stay during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnett|first=Laura|title=You Me Bum Bum Train gives actors a bad ride, says union|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/13/you-me-bum-bum-train-equity|accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper=Theguardian.co.uk|date=13 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/07/equity-warns-sell-out-show-of-possible-minimum-wage-breach/|title=Equity warns sell-out show of possible minimum wage breach - News - The Stage|author=Natalie Woolman|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was criticized for its ticketing system which caused problems for ticket buyers in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/ticketing-bum-bum-train-fire/|title=Ticketing for You Me Bum Bum Train under fire - Carousel, News - The Stage|author=Matthew Hemley|work=Thestage.co.uk|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 the trade union Equity criticised their £150,000 Arts Council England funding as YMBBT were advertising for professional dancers but were not paying them, despite selling tickets "at rates typical of a West End show." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.equity.org.uk/news-and-events/equity-news/equity-questions-arts-council-funding-decision/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/bum-bum-train-comes-fire-actors-union/agencies/article/1374456&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the trade union BECTU criticised YMBBT for "exploiting workers after advertising for unpaid production interns." BECTU launched an investigation concerning "the legality of the “outrageous” internships, which would see successful applicants work at least two days each week for a minimum four hours each day." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2016/bectu-launches-probe-exploitative-bum-bum-train-internships/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2016/alistair-smith-show-producers-pay-stance-hits-a-bum-note/&lt;/ref&gt;
