      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">'''Across the Universe''' is an interstellar radio message (IRM) consisting of the song "[[Across the Universe]]" by [[The Beatles]] that was transmitted on 4 February 2008, at 00:00 [[UTC]] by [[NASA]]  in the direction of the star [[Polaris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/across_universe.html NASA Beams Beatles' 'Across the Universe' into Space]&lt;/ref&gt; This transmission was made using a 70-meter dish in the [[Deep Space Network]]'s (DSN) [[Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex]], located in Robledo, near [[Madrid, Spain]].

This action was done in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the song's recording, the 45th anniversary of the DSN, and the 50th anniversary of NASA. The idea was hatched by Beatles historian [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]], who encouraged all Beatles fans to play the track as it was beamed to the distant star. The event marked the second time a song had ever been intentionally transmitted into [[Outer space|deep space]] (the first being Russia's [[Teen Age Message]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaitsev|first=A.

This IRM project has some significant defects in that the message was aimed at [[Polaris]], which is 431 light years distant from us and whose planetary system, even if it exists, may not be suited for life, because it is a [[supergiant]] star, [[spectral type]] F7Ib. In addition, the [[bit rate|transmission rate]] was very high, about 128 kbit/s, for such moderate [[transmitter power output|transmitter power]] (about 18&amp;nbsp;kW).

'''Active SETI''' ('''Active Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence''') is the attempt to send messages to intelligent extraterrestrial life. Active SETI messages are usually sent in the form of radio signals. Physical messages like that of the [[Pioneer plaque]] may also be considered an active SETI message. Active SETI is also known as '''METI''' ('''Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence'''). The term METI was coined by Russian scientist [[Alexander Zaitsev (scientist)|Alexander Zaitsev]], who denoted the clear-cut distinction between Active SETI and METI:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The science known as [[SETI]] deals with searching for messages from aliens. METI deals with the creation and transmission of messages to aliens. Thus, SETI and METI proponents have quite different perspectives. SETI scientists are in a position to address only the local question “does Active SETI make sense?” In other words, would it be reasonable, for SETI success, to transmit with the object of attracting ETI’s attention? In contrast to Active SETI, METI pursues not a local and lucrative impulse, but a more global and unselfish one – to overcome the Great Silence in the Universe, bringing to our extraterrestrial neighbors the long-expected annunciation '''“You are not alone!”'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, [[Douglas Vakoch|Douglas A. Vakoch]] of the [[SETI Institute]] addressed concerns about the validity of Active SETI alone as an experimental science by proposing the integration of Active SETI and Passive SETI programs to engage in a clearly articulated, ongoing, and evolving set of experiments to test various versions of the [[Zoo Hypothesis]], including specific dates at which a first response to messages sent to particular stars could be expected.&lt;ref&gt;

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [[Douglas Vakoch]], [[David Grinspoon]], [[Seth Shostak]], and [[David Brin]]) at an annual meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the [[Cosmos]] was a good idea;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150213"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-cosmos-risky.html |title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET?

==Rationale for METI==
In the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0910 Rationale for METI], transmission of the information into the Cosmos is treated as one of the pressing needs of an advanced civilization. This view is not universally accepted, and it does not agree to those who are against the transmission of interstellar radio messages, but at the same time are not against SETI searching. Such duality are called [https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0611283 The SETI Paradox].

==Radio message construction==
The lack of an established [[communications protocol]] is a challenge for METI.

First of all, while trying to synthesize an Interstellar Radio Message (IRM), we should bear in mind that Extraterrestrials will first deal with a physical phenomenon and, only after that, perceive the information. At first, ET's receiving system will detect the radio signal; then, the issue of extraction of the received information and comprehension of the obtained message will arise. Therefore, above all, the Constructor of an IRM should be concerned about the ease of signal determination. In other words,
the signal should have maximum openness, which is understood here as an antonym of the term security. This branch of signal synthesis can be named '''anticryptography'''.

To this end, in 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language,&lt;ref name="Testing SETI Messages Design"&gt;

and provided Rachel M. Reddick with a test message, in a blind test of decryption.&lt;ref name="Testing SETI Messages Design"/&gt; Reddick decoded the entire message after approximately twelve hours of work.&lt;ref name="Testing SETI Messages Design"/&gt; This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the [[Lone Signal]] hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor  strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the hailing message.&lt;ref name="Extending the syntax used by the Lone Signal Active SETI project"&gt;

Also characteristics of the radio signal such as wavelength, type of polarization, and modulation have to be considered.

Over galactic distances, the interstellar medium induces some scintillation effects and artificial modulation of electromagnetic signals. This modulation is higher at lower frequencies and is a function of the sky direction. Over large distances, the depth of the modulation can exceed 100%, making any METI signal very difficult to decode.

===Error correction===
In METI research, it is implied that any message must have some redundancy, although the exact amount of redundancy and message formats are still in great dispute.

Using ideograms, instead of binary sequence, already offers some improvement against noise resistance. In faxlike transmissions, ideograms will be spread on many lines. This increases its resistance against short bursts of noise like radio frequency interference or
interstellar scintillation.

One format approach proposed for interstellar messages was to use the product of two prime numbers to construct an image. Unfortunately, this method works only if all the bits are present. As an example, the message sent by [[Frank Drake]] from the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in 1974 did not have any feature to support mechanisms to cope with the inevitable noise degradation of the interstellar medium.

Error correction tolerance rates for previous METI messages
* Arecibo Message (1974) : 8.9% (one page)
* Evpatoria message (1999) : 44% (23 separate pages)
* Evpatoria message (2003) : 46% (one page, estimated)

====Examples====
The 1999 [[Cosmic Call]] transmission was far from being optimal (from our terrestrial point of view) as it was essentially a monochromatic signal spiced with a supplementary information. Additionally, the message had a very small modulation index overall, a condition not viewed as being optimal for interstellar communication.
* Over the 370,967 bits (46,371 bytes) sent, some 314,239 were “1” and 56,768 were “0”—5.54 times as many 1's as 0's.
* Since [[frequency shift keying]] modulation scheme was used, most of the time the signal was on the “0” frequency.
* In addition, “0” tended to be sent in long stretches (white lines in the message).

==Realized projects==
These projects have targeted stars between 17 and 69 light-years from the Earth. The exception is the [[Arecibo message]], which targeted [[globular cluster M13]], approximately 24,000 light-years away.

The first message to reach its destination will be [[RuBisCo Stars]], which should reach [[Teegarden's star]], a [[brown dwarf]] in 2021.

==Potential risk==
{{see also |Search for extraterrestrial intelligence#Debate}}
Active SETI has been heavily criticized due to the perceived risk of revealing the location of the Earth to alien civilizations, without some process of prior international consultation. Notable among its critics is scientist and science fiction author [[David Brin]], particularly in his article "expose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifeboat.com/ex/shouting.at.the.cosmos |title=Shouting at the Cosmos |author=David Brin |date=September 2006 |orig-year=last updated July 2008 |website=Lifeboat Foundation |accessdate=9 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307223116/http://lifeboat.com/ex/shouting.at.the.cosmos|archivedate=7 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Russian and Soviet radio engineer and astronomer [[Alexander L. Zaitsev]] has argued against these fears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sending and searching for interstellar messages |first=Alexander L. |last=Zaitsev |date=September 2008 |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=63 |issue=5–6 |pages=614–617 |via=ScienceDirect |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2008.05.014 |arxiv = 0711.2368 |bibcode = 2008AcAau..63..614Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jre.cplire.ru/jre/may08/2/text_e.html |title=Detection Probability of Terrestrial Radio Signals by a Hostile Super-civilization |author=Alexander L.

To lend a quantitative basis to discussions of the risks of transmitting deliberate messages from Earth, the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iaaseti.org |title=Overview |website=International Academy of Astronautics – SETI Permanent Committee |accessdate=9 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510081227/http://iaaseti.org/|archivedate=10 May 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted in 2007 a new analytical tool, the [[San Marino Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iaaseti.org/smiscale.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208183315/http://iaaseti.org/smiscale.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 December 2007|title=The San Marino Scale |website=International Academy of Astronautics – SETI Permanent Committee |accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by Prof. [[Ivan Almar]] and Prof. [[H. Paul Shuch]], the San Marino Scale evaluates the significance of transmissions from Earth as a function of signal intensity and information content.  Its adoption suggests that not all such transmissions are created equal, thus each must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis before establishing blanket international policy regarding Active SETI.

In 2012, Jacob Haqq-Misra, Michael Busch, Sanjoy Som, and Seth Baum argued that while the benefits of radio communication on Earth likely outweigh the potential harms of detection by extraterrestrial watchers, the uncertainty regarding the outcome of contact with extraterrestrial beings creates difficulty in assessing whether or not to engage in long-term and large-scale METI.&lt;ref name="haqq-misra-2013"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[João Pedro de Magalhães]] proposed transmitting an invitation message to any extraterrestrial intelligences watching us already in the context of the [[Zoo Hypothesis]] and inviting them to respond. By using existing television and radio channels, de Magalhães argued this would not put us in any danger, "at least not in any more danger than we are already if much more advanced extraterrestrial civilizations are aware of us and can reach the solar system."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=de Magalhaes |first=J. P. |arxiv=1509.03652 |title=A direct communication proposal to test the Zoo Hypothesis |date=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2016.06.001 |volume=38 |journal=Space Policy |pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Vakoch]], president of METI, argues that passive SETI itself is already an endorsement of active SETI, since "If we detect a signal from aliens through a SETI program, there’s no way to prevent a cacophony of responses from Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Hannah Osborne |url=http://www.newsweek.com/advanced-alien-civilization-send-messages-meti-713186 |title=Scientists Have Sent Messages to Advanced Alien Civilizations—And Are Hoping for a Reply in 25 Years |date=2017-11-16 |work=Newsweek |access-date=2017-11-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117024323/http://www.newsweek.com/advanced-alien-civilization-send-messages-meti-713186 |archivedate=2017-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beacon proposals==
One proposal for a 10 billion watt interstellar SETI beacon was dismissed by [[Robert A. Freitas Jr.]] to be infeasible for a pre-Type I civilization on the [[Kardashev scale]].&lt;ref name="IP"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this 1980s technical argument assumes omni-directional beacons which may not be the best way to proceed on many technical grounds. Advances in consumer electronics have made possible transmitters that simultaneously transmit many narrow beams, covering the million or so nearest stars but not the spaces between.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This multibeam approach can reduce the power and cost to levels that are reasonable with current mid-2000s Earth technology.

Once civilizations have discovered each other's locations, the energy requirements for maintaining contact and exchanging information can be significantly reduced through the use of highly directional transmission technologies.

A 2018 study estimated an 1 to 2 megawatt infrared laser focused through a 30 to 45 meter telescope could be seen from about 20,000 light years away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/11/08/magnified-laser-from-earth-could-attract-alien-attention-mit-researcher-says/HrbyazamrVaQ1NaBJhdllJ/story.html Magnified laser from Earth could attract alien attention, MIT researcher says]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Age segregation''' is the separation of people based on their [[Ageing|age]], and may be observed in many aspects of some societies.&lt;ref&gt;L Steinberg, ''Adolescence'' (4th edition, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of institutionalized age segregation include [[age segregation in schools]], and [[age-segregated housing]].There are studies of informal age segregation among [[adolescent]]s.&lt;ref name="springer1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montemayor|first=Raymond|last2=Komen|first2=Roger Van|date=1980-10-01|title=Age segregation of adolescents in and out of school|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02087675|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=9|issue=5|pages=371–381|doi=10.1007/BF02087675|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OiyN52CQgbcC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22age+segregation%22+adolescents&amp;source=web&amp;ots=d2dX349Neu&amp;sig=clyC0WKSkHUH_6Q3oLdzDMyr-qc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result|title=Evolutionary Principles of Human Adolescence|last=Weisfeld|first=Glenn|date=1999-05-31|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780813333182|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Age segregation in schools, age grading, or graded education is the separation of [[student]]s into years of education ([[educational stages|grade]]s, [[form (education)|form]]s) by approximately the same [[Ageing|age]].

In the [[United States]], graded education was introduced during 1848 to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Dean McClusky, "Introduction of Grading into the Public Schools of New England, Part II", ''The Elementary School Journal'', Vol. 21, No. 2 (October 1920), pp. 132-145&lt;/ref&gt;Age segregation in the U.S. was a product of industrialization, Western formal schooling, [[child labor]] laws, social services agencies, and the rise of disciplines such as psychology and education. A combination of these caused a shift from family working as a unit to separation of economic activities and childcare emerged.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rogoff, B., Glida, M. and Chavajay, P. (2010). Children's Integration in Communities and Segregation From People of Differing Ages. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 5(4), pp.431-440&lt;/ref&gt; Some communities have different cultural practices and [[Child Integration|integrate children]] into mature activities of the family and community. This is common among Indigenous American communities.

Age segregation is seen by some like Peter Uhlenberg and Jenny Gierveld to benefit individuals by bringing like-minded individuals together to share similar facilities, network and information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Uhlenberg|first1=Peter|last2=Gierveld|first2=Jenny|date=28 January 2004|title=Age-segregation in later life: an examination of personal networks|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/S0144686X0300151X|journal=Ageing and Society|volume=24(1)|pages=5-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly are however disadvantaged by segregation in that they risk being excluded from economic and social developments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effects of Age Segregation==

Researchers have argued that age grading in school has significant impact on age segregation among adolescent [[peer group]]s.&lt;ref name="springer1" /&gt; It is also present in the work force, which can make it more difficult for older adults to find jobs or change employment paths because of their age. They are often either expected to have a significantly larger background of experience in the field, or be far enough away from retirement to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Ilmakunnas, Seija Ilmakunnas, (2014) "Age segregation and hiring of older employees: low mobility revisited", , Vol. 35 Issue: 8, pp.1090-1115, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1108/IJM-04-2012-0060&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although seen less in younger adults and children, there is evidence{{Specify}} that younger populations segregate within themselves. Until around ages 7 and 8, children tend to only associate with people within 2 years of their own age. Children mostly segregate from adults, showing less adult interaction as they move into their teenage and young adult years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Shari|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|last3=Cromer|first3=Cindy C.|date=1981|title=Age segregation in children's social interactions.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/17/4/399|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=399–407|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.4.399|issn=0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that the gap in age segregation will grow because of technological knowledge seen in younger adults that is not seen in older adults. It is predicted that younger adults will have to teach older adults about new social environments that will be essential to healthy living. Without these teachings, age segregation is set to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uhlenberg|first=Peter|last2=Gierveld|first2=Jenny De Jong|date=January 2004|title=Age-segregation in later life: an examination of personal networks|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ageing-and-society/article/agesegregation-in-later-life-an-examination-of-personal-networks/C28132E72D8B6AC52D4FE7730F5B8916|journal=Ageing &amp;amp; Society|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=5–28|doi=10.1017/S0144686X0300151X|issn=1469-1779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the prospects for designing social life to overcome the entrenched practices of age segregation and the cultural assumptions through  the life course is through a steady flock of opportunities for cross-age interaction, some settings facilitate age-integrated social relations. The most distinguished  example is the family, in which children, parents, and grandparents frequently develop close cross-age relationships. Age relations within families vary across cultures and subcultures. According to Uhlenberg and Gierveld, many lower class black families in the United States have high levels of interaction with kin, and older adults. This often provides significant care for younger members in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Singapore ===
A statistical analysis of survey data of a survey data for 390 elderly people living  in studio apartments found that age-segregation have a humongous impact on the quality of life of the elderly people because the perception of the elderly in relation to factors that are most outstanding  to their quality of life is at variance with that of the policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdb.gov.sg/|title=Homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB)|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== United States of America ===
In the United States some portions of a person's life involves being with the same age cohort.  Industrialization brought an increased specialization of all kinds, and age was an important category used to sort people. Society expected teachers to be experts on a particular age group, family members to specialize in different kinds of work, and people to move through major life roles in a fixed pattern. The work force involvement of older women and men declined, and it was replaced by leisure retirement. Martin Kohli argues that over the length of the twentieth century, age was  enormously used to assign people to or prohibit them from particular activities. The result was a tendency toward a firmly fixed life course. According to Riley and Riley, this tendency toward age-segregated structures began to approximate the age-differentiated "ideal type" structure in which people gain their education when young, work in middle-age, and enjoy their well-earned leisure time when they are old. Age-based grades, teams, jobs, and leisure activities seemed normal; people were expected to spend major portions of their days and lives with people of their own age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/age-integration-and-age-segregation|title=Age Integration and Age Segregation|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia.com, Encyclopedia of Aging|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 article for ''[[Perspectives on Psychological Science]]'', authors Rogoff et al state that age-segregated housing can hold some advantages for the elderly such as a higher chance of having more things in common with their peers. This segregation can also decrease their involvement with societies that are preoccupied with the desirability of youth and give them the ability to discuss their fears of death and the frequent deaths of others. Some retirement villages are heavily secured, which can give the elders a sense of safety and protection. An older person is more likely to be noticed in an age segregated community if he or she is in need of help. The elderly people living in such a community also receive lower rates because of the quantity of similar goods and services needed by their communities. Some of the disadvantages of age-segregated housing are isolation from mainstream society, preventing older people from sharing wisdom and experiences with younger people and leading old people to have restricted sets of friendships and neighbors. In some elderly people age-segregated housing can contribute to low morale and feelings of uselessness and rejection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ascribed characteristics''', as used in the [[social sciences]], refers to properties of an individual attained at birth, by inheritance, or through the aging process. The individual has very little, if any, control over these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: A Global Perspective|last=Ferrante|first=Joan|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples include race, ethnicity, gender, caste, height, and appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John Robert|publisher=Cenage|year=|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is apt for describing characteristics chiefly caused by "nature" (e.g. genetics) and for those chiefly caused by "nurture" (e.g. parenting during early childhood), See: [[Nature versus nurture|Nature versus Nurture]].

== Use Within Demography ==

Demography being the statistical study of populations requires the ability to differentiate between populations. Most populations self-ascribe themselves as being different than another by the creation of a country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel|title=Milestones: 1945–1952 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This allows Demographers to draw lines between countries and compare them. However useful, countries have significant complex populations that require more exacting definitions. Commonly seen are uses of [[Race (human categorization)|Race]], [[Gender]] and [[Ethnicity]]. In the scope of academic demography, all of these are [[Social construction of gender|Social Constructs]], '''ASCRIBED''' to groups or individuals for Stratification &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/06/16/how-fluid-is-racial-identity/race-and-racial-identity-are-social-constructs|title=Race and Racial Identity Are Social Constructs|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender roles : a sociological perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda|isbn=9780205899685|edition=Sixth|location=Boston|oclc=892213147|date = December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With these [[Theory|theories]] in place, many new theories can be formed and data collected to either prove or disprove them. Ascribed characteristics can have large by-products weather perceived or not. Discussed below are Race, Gender, [[Social status|Social Status]] / [[Caste]] and Hiring / Promotion.

=== Race ===
Ascribed characteristics are not always used for academic purposes. People with certain ascribed characteristics can be systematically treated with prejudice. Thus, the study of [[racism]] can be seen, at least superficially, as the study of the ways that people with a certain skin color and cultural background are systematically treated differently by society at large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourse and Discrimination: Rhetorics Of Racism and Antisemitism|last=Resigl|first=Martin|last2=Wodak|first2=Ruth|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Race does not entirely have a 

=== Gender ===
[https://www.uu.nl/staff/fvantubergen/0 Frank van Tubergen] studied the how ascribed characteristics and achieved characteristics effect their [[Social capital|Social Capital]] in the article ''Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Tubergen|first=Frank|last2=Al-Modaf|first2=Obaid Ali|last3=Almosaed|first3=Nora F.|last4=Al-Ghamdi|first4=Mohammed Ben Said|title=Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics|journal=Social Networks|volume=45|pages=45–54|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2015.10.007|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The article highlighted that women have less social capital than men in [[Saudi Arabia]] citing specifically that it was "due to fewer non-family connections". There are many arguments that stem from disagreements over the definition of what is a fact when it comes to gender, showing the fluidity of ascribed characteristics. For example, people who find [[homosexuality]] morally objectionable may attempt to justify this by insisting that homosexuals make a conscious decision about the nature of the sexual desire they experience however, it would difficult to condemn homosexuality if homosexuality was predetermined, either genetically or from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Q|last2=Wilson|first2=G.D|year=2003|title=Sexual orientation and the 2nd to 4th finger length ratio: evidence for organising effects of sex hormones or developmental instability?|url=|journal=International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=28|pages=288–303|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Sexual orientation]].). Both Groups do however use the term all the same, simply '''ascribing''' different definitions to those individuals.

=== Social Status / Caste ===
Many different societies have had varying types of social stratification both historically and in the modern era. One of the most obvious examples is [[India]], and its [[Caste system in India|Caste System]]. In its essence, it was a system that ascribed sweepers the lowest status, making this one group literally untouchable. Although India officially states that discrimination against lower castes is illegal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf][http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf CRIME AGAINST PERSONS BELONGING TO SCs / STs]'''Government of India, National Crime Records Bureau''' (2011), page 108&lt;/ref&gt;.   

=== Hiring / Promotion ===

[[Ronald P. Dore]] was a British sociologist that was a specialist in the Japanese Economy. His view will be expressed here. In his largest work, ''British Factory, Japanese Factory''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British factory, Japanese factory : the origins of national diversity in industrial relations|last=Dore|first=Ronald|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520024953|location=Berkeley|pages=|oclc=20130326}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Dore investigates whether decisions on hiring and promotion, in the Japanese firm Hitachi, over a particular time were based chiefly on "achievement" or chiefly on "ascribed characteristics". The context of the discussion implied that achievement-based decisions are good, while those based on ascribed characteristics are bad. His discussion admits explicitly and, implicitly, that there are several complications to moral judgement that include:

* Some achievement characteristics are positively correlated with some ascribed characteristics such as intelligence and socioeconomic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strenze|first=Tarmo|date=2007-09-01|title=Intelligence and socioeconomic success: A meta-analytic review of longitudinal research|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606001127|journal=Intelligence|volume=35|issue=5|pages=401–426|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "the power to command...may be much more likely to be bred in upper class families" to the extent that "the power to command" is viewed as a measure of merit. Promotion decisions favoring high merit would not be entirely distinguishable from making promotion decisions favoring high class thus, it can be difficult, to tell whether a particular promotion decision has been made for just or unjust reasons.
* It is possible to, "irrelevantly acquire discriminatory characteristics", or even do so intentionally. For example, by converting to a new religion or getting married. 
* It is reasonable to view even some ascribed characteristics as factors that should affect employee compensation. In Hitachi, for example, pay is positively correlated both with performance and with age. The latter is an ascribed characteristic, but Dore suggests that it is a perfectly reasonable consideration, especially since expenses such as childcare, tend to increase over the duration of employment at Hitachi.

Dore also points out that what counts as an ascribed characteristic can vary depending on context. In evaluating the fairness of hiring standards, he viewed an applicant's success in the educational system as a good approximation of achievement. Thus, he noted that hiring decisions at Hitachi, during the time of his study, were "regulated by very strict qualification standards" and not very significantly influenced by ascribed characteristics. When he turned to evaluate opportunities for advancement within the firm, however, Dore noted that "educational qualifications...limit the range of posts which one can achieve". Meaning even if one's level of achievement increases, one may still be kept down by a relative lack of achievement in the educational system. Therefore, in investigating opportunities for promotions, educational achievement " the two become another form of ascribed characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hearn|first=James C.|title=Attendance at higher-cost colleges: Ascribed, socioeconomic, and academic influences on student enrollment patterns|journal=Economics of Education Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–76|doi=10.1016/0272-7757(88)90072-6|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional forms of ascribed characteristics expand on the definition of an ascribed characteristic allowing for it to have more applications.

'''Body Worlds''' ([[German language|German]] title: Körperwelten) is a traveling exposition of dissected human bodies, animals, and other [[Anatomy|anatomical]] structures of the body that have been preserved through the process of [[plastination]]. [[Gunther von Hagens]] developed the preservation process which "unite[s] subtle anatomy and modern polymer chemistry",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koerperwelten.com/de/plastination/plastinationsprozess.html|title=Plastination|website=www.koerperwelten.com|access-date=14 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601170955/http://www.koerperwelten.com/de/plastination/plastinationsprozess.html|archive-date=1 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1970s.

A series of ''Body Worlds'' anatomical exhibitions has toured many countries worldwide, sometimes raising controversies about the sourcing and display of actual human corpses and body parts. Nevertheless, Von Hagens maintains that all human specimens were obtained with full knowledge and consent of the donors before they died, and his organization keeps extensive documentation of this permission. Von Hagens emphasizes both educational and artistic aspects of his complex and innovative dissections, and offers online teaching guides for educators. He also tries to distinguish his efforts from those of competitors who may have been less thorough in obtaining advance permission from their specimen sources.

==Background==
[[File:Body Worlds Exhibit San Diego 2009.jpg|thumb|Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds, San Diego, California, 2009]]

===Method===
The exhibit states that its purpose and mission is the education of laymen about the human body, leading to better health awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelm.co.uk/video_4x3.html?bcpid=1213934526&amp;bctid=1454906724 |title=Channel M No Smoking Day 12 March 2008 |publisher=Channelm.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the human plastinates are from people who donated their bodies for plastination via a body donation program. Each Body Worlds exhibition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=15 |title=Body Worlds Exhibitions |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175844/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=15# |archive-date=16 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; contains approximately 25 full-body plastinates with expanded or selective [[organ (biology)|organs]] shown in positions that enhance the role of certain systems.

To produce specimens for ''Body Worlds'', von Hagens employs 340 people at five laboratories in three countries, China, Germany and Kyrgyzstan. Each laboratory is categorized by specialty, with the China laboratory focusing on animal specimens. One of the most difficult specimens to create was the [[giraffe]] that appears in ''Body Worlds &amp; The Cycle of Life''. The specimen took three years to complete – ten times longer than it takes to prepare a human body. Ten people are required to move the giraffe, because its final weight (like all specimens after plastination) is equal to the original animal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

More than 200 specimens of real human organs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=4 |title=Plastinated Organs |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115101531/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=4# |archive-date=15 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and organ systems are displayed in glass cases, some showing various medical conditions. Some of the specimens, such as the Tai Chi Man, demonstrate interventions, and include [[prosthesis|prosthetics]] such as [[hip replacement|artificial hip]] [[joint]]s or [[heart valve]]s. Also featured is a liver with cirrhosis and the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker are placed side by side. A prenatal display features fetuses and [[embryo]]s, some with [[congenital disorder]]s.

===Tours===
Body Worlds exhibitions have received more than 37 million visitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/past_exhibitions.html |title=Exhibitions |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522014837/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/past_exhibitions.html# |archive-date=22 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the world's most popular touring attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,443881,00.html |title=Fox news Dead Body Show Promotes Health, Exhibitor Says |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds'' was first presented in [[Tokyo]] in 1995. Body Worlds exhibitions have since been hosted by more than 50 museums and venues in North America, Europe and Asia. ''Body Worlds 2 &amp; The Brain – Our Three Pound Gem'' (concerning the brain and [[nervous system]]) opened in 2005 at the [[California Science Center]] in [[Los Angeles]]. {{As of|2010|September}} it is showing at the [[Science World (Vancouver)|Telus World of Science]] in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceworld.ca/bodyworlds|title=Galleries &amp; Theatres - Science World British Columbia|website=www.scienceworld.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Body Worlds exhibits (as well as Von Hagens himself) were featured in the 2006 film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Among the plastinates featured were the ''Poker Playing Trio'' (which plays a key role in one scene) and ''Rearing Horse and Rider''.

''Body Worlds 3 &amp; The Story of the Heart'' (concerning the [[cardiovascular system]]) opened on 25 February 2006, at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]]. On 9 July 2009 this show appeared at the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. {{As of|2010|May}}, it is showing at the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Denver]], Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmns.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions Current Exhibitions], Denver Museum of Nature and Science.

==Regulatory framework==

===Czech Republic===
In July 2008, the Czech Senate passed a law to address illegal trading in human tissue and ban "advertising of donation of human cells and tissues for money or similar advantages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=323506 |title=Czech Senate toughens rules for handling of human tissue |publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On Tuesday 21 April 2009, a French judge ruled concerning the [[Paris]] exhibition of ''Our Body: The Universe Within'', that exhibiting dead bodies for profit was a "violation of the respect owed to them". "Under the law, the proper place for corpses is in the cemetery", said Judge Louis-Marie Raingeard. Raingeard ordered the exhibition to close within 24 hours or face a fine of 20,000 euro (over 26,000 dollars) for each day it stayed open. The judge also ordered authorities to seize the 17 bodies on display and all of the organs on display from an unknown number of people for proper burial. Gunther Von Hagens issued a press statement denying any connection between the closed Chinese exhibition and his Body Worlds franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7411070 France Shuts Down Popular Bodies Show]&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Similar exhibitions had already been successfully staged in [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]].

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] created legislation for exhibits of human remains, including plastinated bodies and body parts, in [[England and Wales]] under the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]]. This requires a licence to be granted by the [[Human Tissue Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hta.gov.uk/licensing.cfm HTA Licensing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424090842/http://www.hta.gov.uk/licensing.cfm |date=24 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Tissue Act superseded the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], which had been found by an independent commission (The Redfern Report)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/31/alderhey1 |title=UK, Main findings of the Redfern report |publisher=Guardian |date= 31 January 2001|accessdate=25 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be inadequate on contemporary collection and use of human tissues, following the [[Alder Hey organs scandal]]. In March 2008, the [[Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]] was granted such a licence to hold ''Body Worlds 4'' and a further licence was granted to the exhibition in the O2, London, in 2008.

====Scotland====
The [[Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006]] – which amended the Anatomy Act 1984 – covers Scotland. Under the terms of this Act, licences for the handling of human remains, including display, must be granted directly by the Scottish Ministry.

{{quote|Subsection 9: If the Scottish Ministers think it desirable to do so in the interests of education, training or research, they may grant a license to a person to publicly display the body or, as the case may be, the part, and a person is authorized under this subsection to so display a body or a part of a body if, at the time of the display he is licensed under this subsection.}}

Various organizations gave evidence to the [[Scottish Executive]] during the consultation process, including the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], the [[Wellcome Trust]], and the [[Museums Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/ma/11480 |title=Response by the Museums Association on the Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill |publisher=Museums Association |date=8 September 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Various legislation has been proposed and enacted in different American states. Most proposals concentrate on issues regarding the sale of human remains and the consent of the donors.

National legislation on consent and tissue donation issues is expressed in the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomicalgiftact.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=63 |title=Anatomical Gift Act |publisher=Anatomical Gift Act |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923090355/http://www.anatomicalgiftact.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=63# |archive-date=23 September 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] which states that "an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part may be made during the life of the donor for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education" and prohibits trafficking in donated human organs for profit.

In early 2008, former U.S. Republican Representative [[Todd Akin|W. Todd Akin]] proposed an amendment to the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] of 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesurge.com/bills/69436-hr5677-federal |title=Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 |publisher=Statesurge.com |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "make it unlawful for a person to import plastinated human remains into the United States." The President of the American Association of Anatomists has expressed concern that the scope of the act is "too broad" and that "Preventing importation of all plastinated specimens could severely restrict their use for medical education.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomy.org/Files/private/newsletters/aaa_sept_nl.pdf |title=American Association of Anatomists Newsletter Vol. 17, No. 3, September 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110113/http://www.anatomy.org/Files/private/newsletters/aaa_sept_nl.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill of amendment was not enacted during the 2007–2008 Congressional session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-5677 |title=H.R. 5677: To amend the Tariff Act of 1930 |publisher=Govtrack.us |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
California's proposed bill AB1519 (Ma), sponsored by Assemblywoman [[Fiona Ma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ma |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1501-1550/ab_1519_bill_20080617_amended_sen_v92.html |title=California State bill AB1519 (Ma) |publisher=Leginfo.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to "require exhibitors to get a county permit; to do so, they would have to prove to county health officials that the people whose cadavers were on display — or their next of kin — had consented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corpse25jan25,0,2070702.story |title=Cadaver shows raise consent concerns – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=25 January 2008 |first=Marc |last=Lifsher |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129210804/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corpse25jan25%2C0%2C2070702.story |archivedate=29 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembly Bill 1519 would have made California the first state to require such proof.&lt;ref name="californiachronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/71686 |title=Legislation to Regulate Dead Body Exhibits Moves on to The Governor |publisher=Californiachronicle.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911144748/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/71686 |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was vetoed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on 26 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1501-1550/ab_1519_bill_20080926_history.html A.B. No. 1519 bill history, from the Government of California]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====
The state of [[Florida]] prohibits the sale or purchase of human remains and "Authorizes certain science centers located in this state to transport plastinated bodies into, within, or out of this state and exhibit such bodies for the purpose of public education without the consent of this state's anatomical board if the science center notifies the board of any such transportation or exhibition, as well as the location and duration of any exhibition, at least 30 days before such transportation or exhibition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=sb2554.html&amp;Directory=session/2007/Senate/bills/billtext/html/ |title=State of Florida Legislation |publisher=Leg.state.fl.us |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In January 2009, Rep. Marcus Oshiro introduced two bills prompted by presentation of the BODIES Exhibition in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbulletin.com/editorials/20090129_Enact_restrictions_on_cadavers_shown_in_public_exhibits.html |title=Enact restrictions on cadavers shown in public exhibits |publisher=Starbulletin.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HB28 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would add to the prohibition against buying dead human bodies, the selling of dead human bodies and defines the term "dead human body" to include plastinated bodies and body parts. It would increase the fine for buying or selling a dead human body to up to $5,000.

HB29 Relating to Dead Human Bodies. Would prohibit the commercial display of dead human bodies without a permit from the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Georgette |url=http://hawaiihouseblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/inspired-by-bodies.html |title=Hawaii House Blog: Inspired by Bodies |publisher=Hawaiihouseblog.blogspot.com |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York====
In June 2008, [[New York (state)|New York]] State Senate passed legislation regulating body exhibits. A bill that was sponsored by Senator Jim Alesi requires anyone showing an exhibit that uses real human bodies in New York museums to produce a permit detailing their origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=17741 |title=Rochester Homepage Cracking down on human body exhibits |publisher=Rochesterhomepage.net |date=19 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208180852/http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=17741 | archivedate = 8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
Representative [[Mike Fleck|Mike Fleck's]] proposed bill would require evidence of informed consent from the decedent or relatives of all humans whose remains are put on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=2299&amp;pn=3339 |title=Pennsylvania bodies exhibit regulatory bill |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington====
The state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] considered a bill that would "require written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/Summary.aspx?bill=1253&amp;year=2007 |title=State of Washington Bill Requiring written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose |publisher=Apps.leg.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Religious objections===
Religious groups, including representatives of the [[Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://rcav.org/2010-09-30-concerns-about-body-worlds/ Archdiocese of Vancouver – Body Worlds Exhibit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125000/http://rcav.org/2010-09-30-concerns-about-body-worlds/ |date=13 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Jewish]] rabbis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=DEBORAH SUSSMAN SUSSER Associate Editor |url=http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070209+body |title='Body Worlds' comes to Phoenix – Jewish News of Greater Phoenix |publisher=Jewishaz.com |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609080641/http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070209+body |archive-date=9 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the display of human remains, stating that it is inconsistent with reverence towards the human body.

===Sex plastinate===
In 2003, while promoting a display in the Hamburg Museum of Erotica, von Hagens announced his intention to create a sex plastinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806412221471 |title=Prof in Corpse Sex plan |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613044212/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806412221471 |archivedate=13 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 he unveiled a plastinate of a couple having sex, intended for a Berlin exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Von Peter Kiefer Und Claudia Weingärtner |url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/regional/berlin/aktuell/2009/05/05/koerperwelten-dr-tod-gunther-von-hagens/er-zeigt-leichen-beim-sex.html |title=Dr. Tod zeigt Leichensex in Berlin |publisher=Bild.de |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lessening donor organ availability===
In 2007, the [[Bishop of Manchester]] launched a campaign&lt;ref&gt;Bishop of Manchester's campaign Site Corpseshow.info&lt;/ref&gt; to coincide with the opening of Body Worlds in that city, accusing the exhibitors of being "body snatchers" and "robbing the NHS", arguing that donation of bodies for plastination would deprive the [[National Health Service]] of organs for transplant. The site included a government petition calling for "a review of the law regarding the policies and practices of touring shows involving corpses".

===Consent===
{{see also|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China}}
Consent is a primary focus of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B7GWX-4R71KF2-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=6ba114742d1043defa8f00ec7295486b |title=Looking Back and Looking Ahead |publisher=Science Direct |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |doi=10.1016/j.aanat.2007.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that von Hagens had acquired corpses of executed prisoners in China; von Hagens countered that he did not know the origin of the bodies, and returned seven disputed cadavers to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis in Paris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/21/corpse-france-hagens-ouvert |title= French Judge Closes Body Worlds Style Exhibition of Corpses |work= The Guardian |date= 21 April 2009|accessdate=25 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, von Hagens obtained an injunction against ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' for making the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressemeldinger.no/read.asp?RecNo=15417 |title=Institute fur Plastination, Statement on Wrongful Allegations and False Reports by Media on the Origin of Bodies in BODY WORLDS Exhibitions, press release |publisher=Pressemeldinger.no |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Harris, director of North Carolina's State Board of Funeral Services, has stated, "Somebody at some level of government ought to be able to look at a death certificate, a statement from an embalmer, donation documents... That's a reasonable standard to apply."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-02-28/winter-bodyexhibits/ Body exhibits titillate, but are they legal? — JSCMS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224010254/http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-02-28/winter-bodyexhibits/ |date=24 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblywoman Fiona Ma (D-San Francisco) said, "These displays do have important educational benefits, but using bodies against a person's will is unacceptable".&lt;ref name="californiachronicle.com"/&gt;

Questions raised regarding deceased hospital patients from [[Kyrgyzstan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/E_Kirgisien%20AW%20GVH%202.pdf |title=Kirghisien No Skeletons in the Closet — Facts, Background and Conclusions: A response to the alleged corpse scandals in Novosibirsk, Russia, and Bishkek, Kyrgizstan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110115/http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/E_Kirgisien%20AW%20GVH%202.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and executed prisoners from [[China]] – were categorically stated to have never been used in a Body Worlds exhibition, according to BodyWorlds. "Five years ago, customs officers intercepted 56 bodies and hundreds of brain samples sent from the Novosibirsk Medical Academy to von Hagens' lab in Heidelberg, Germany. The cadavers were traced to a Russian medical examiner who was convicted last year of illegally selling the bodies of homeless people, prisoners and indigent hospital patients. Von Hagens was not charged with any wrongdoing, and says his cadavers are obtained only through proper legal and ethical channels.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687|title=Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ethical Commission set up by the [[California Science Center]] in Los Angeles in 2004 had the following members: 
Reverend Richard Benson, Assistant Prof of Moral Theology and Academic Dean, 
St. John's Seminar, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles;
David C. Blake, PhD, JD, VP, Mission and Ethics,
Saint John's Health Center;
Rabbi Morley Feinstein,
Senior Rabbi, University Synagogue;
Reverend Leonard Jackson,
Associate Minister,
First African Methodist Episcopal Church (First AME). 
They determined that 
"All the bodies need to be properly donated. Advisors felt that this is the most controversial aspect of the project. Proper body donation should be verified to the Science Center's satisfaction, and involves several components. Several advisors reviewed the Body Donor and felt it should be reviewed to ensure that it meets an adequate standard of disclosure and informed consent. They recommended that the form should be clear to make sure the bodies in the exhibit consented to public display. The source of donated bodies should be verifiable; Ask an independent party to review donor forms, verifying that all bodies are donated properly.; Communicate to guests, near the entrance of the exhibit, that the bodies are donated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115125640/http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |archive-date=15 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an ethical concern, consent is not regulated worldwide according to the same ethics. "That paperwork is then separated from the bodies, which can be used for displays or sold in pieces to medical schools. No one will know for sure, because each plastinated corpse is made anonymous to protect its privacy."&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Hans Martin Sass, a philosophy professor with a speciality in ethics, was hired by the California Science Center to investigate Body Worlds before the show's U.S. debut in 2004. He matched over 200 donation forms to death certificates, but he did not match the paperwork to specific bodies von Hagens has on display.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

===Import law concerns===
International trade experts have objected to the way in which bodies for commercial display are imported, because the way their categorization codes (as "art collections") do not require [[Centers for Disease Control]] stamps or death certificates, both of which are required for medical cadavers.&lt;ref&gt;Television broadcast: Channel 3SAT, 1 May 2000,"Die Leichenshow" ("The Cadaver Show")&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries plastinated human specimens are classified under Customs Classification Code 97050000.48 "items in anatomical collections". This customs code encompasses "zoological, botanical, mineralogical or anatomical collections or items in such collections."&lt;ref&gt;Warenverzeichnis für die Außenhandelsstatistik (List of goods for statistics on exports), 1998 Edition of the Federal Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical concerns about cadaver displays===
In an ethical analysis, Thomas Hibbs, professor of ethics and culture at [[Baylor University]], a private [[Baptist]]-affiliated institution, compared cadaver displays to pornography, in that they reduce the subject to "the manipulation of body parts stripped of any larger human significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=eResources, http://www.eResources.com |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/15/soa/bodyworlds.htm |title=A Journal of Technology and Society – Dead Body Porn – Thomas S.

In a 2006 lecture entitled "Plasti-Nation: How America was Won",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Plasti-Nation: How America Was Won |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/plastination_how_america_was_w_1.html |title=Public Lectures: Plasti-Nation: How America Was Won Archives |publisher=Blog.lib.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628063801/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/plastination_how_america_was_w_1.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucia Tanassi, professor of medical ethics and anthropology at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]], explored questions for ethicists regarding this new scientific frontier. Tanassi called it provocative that ethics committees have contributed to the popularization of the exhibits without setting forth any process of a line of inquiry, pointing to an ethics report from the California Science Center. As part of that review, bioethicist Hans Martin Sass was sent to Heidelberg to match donor consents with death certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687 |title=Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been expressed about the educational aspects, especially the inclusion of these displays for school field trips. St. Louis Diocese Archbishop Raymond Burke strongly suggested that Catholic Schools avoid scheduling field trips, stating that parents, and not children, should retain the freedom of deciding whether or not their children will view the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4201800&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |title=St. Louis Ticket Broker &amp;#124; St Louis Cardinals &amp; St Louis Blues Tickets &amp;#124; Mizzou Football Tickets from The Ticket Guys |publisher=Myfoxstl.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623080125/http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4201800&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |archivedate=23 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned with how "some kids process" these "graphic" images, Des McKay, school superintendent in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]], British Columbia (near [[Greater Vancouver]]), barred field trips to exhibits of plasticized human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vancouver |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=f89ece3d-f0e0-4d55-aa2e-746a9fcd9079&amp;k=63910 |title=Abbotsford schools barred from taking ghoulish field trip |publisher=Canada.com |date=1 October 2006 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208231942/http://www2.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=f89ece3d-f0e0-4d55-aa2e-746a9fcd9079&amp;k=63910 |archivedate=8 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial to the Abbotsford News, Rev.

===Press limitations===
Von Hagens maintains [[copyright]] control over pictures of his exhibits. Visitors are not allowed to take pictures, and press photographers are required to sign agreements permitting only a single publication in a defined context, followed by a return of the copyright to Von Hagens. Because of a similar agreement applied to sound bites (O-Töne, in German) a German press organization suggested that the press refrain from reporting about the exhibition in Munich in 2003 .&lt;ref&gt;Keine O-Töne über Körperwelten [http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20+M532fe2eeb51.0.html Pressemitteilung, Deutscher Journalisten-Verband, 25 August 2003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231505/http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20+M532fe2eeb51.0.html# |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling plastinates===
The Body Worlds website offers plastinated pieces for sale. There are a wide range of products from plastinated fruit jewelry to entire humans. Although some of the pieces require purchasers to be a qualified user—those intending to use the pieces for "research, educational, medical or therapeutic purposes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donating Your Body For Plastination|url=http://www.bodymobil.de/Downloads/Deutsch/Downloads/Brosch/BD_Brochure_EN_EU08_240613.pdf|publisher=Institute for Plastination|accessdate=24 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232216/http://www.bodymobil.de/Downloads/Deutsch/Downloads/Brosch/BD_Brochure_EN_EU08_240613.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;—many pieces, including animal testicles and baby chicks, require no authorization. There are also extremely realistic plastinate impressions of human hearts and slices (including one slice of copulating humans) for sale to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plastination-products.com/Blood-vessel-configuration/Human-blood-vessel-configuration/Hearts/Human-heart-natural::1239.html |title=Menschliches Herz; natürlich – von Hagens Onlineshop |publisher=Plastination-products.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitors ==
The success of Body Worlds has given rise to several similar shows featuring plastinated cadavers, including ''[[BODIES... The Exhibition]]'' and ''Our Body: The Universe Within'' in the [[United States]], ''[[Bodies Revealed]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Body Exploration'' in the [[Republic of China]], ''Mysteries of the Human Body'' in [[South Korea]], ''[[Jintai Plastomic]]: Mysteries of the Human Body'' in [[Japan]], ''Cuerpos Entrañables'' in [[Spain]].

Some of these contain exhibits very similar to von Hagens' plastinates; Von Hagens has asserted copyright protection, and has sued ''Body Exploration'' and ''Bodies Revealed''.
The suits were based on a presumed copyright of certain positions of the bodies, but the [[counterparty]] asserts that the human body in its diversity cannot be copyrighted.

Such lawsuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1145538532408 |title=Body Exhibits Attract Suits on Contracts, Copyrights |publisher=Law.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have not stopped the competition. While the Korean police in Seoul confiscated a few exhibits from ''Bodies Revealed'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110112/http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the exhibition went on successfully.

Several of the competing exhibitions have been organized by the publicly traded US company [[Premier Exhibitions]]. They started their first ''Bodies Revealed'' exhibition in [[Blackpool, England]] which ran from August through October 2004. In 2005 and 2006 the company opened their ''Bodies Revealed'' and ''BODIES... The Exhibition'' exhibitions in Seoul, Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Seattle. Other exhibition sites in 2006 are Mexico City, Atlanta (GA), London, Great Britain and Las Vegas (Nevada).

Unlike Body Worlds, none of the competing exhibitions or their suppliers have a body donation programme. Dr. Roy Glover, a spokesperson for ''BODIES... The Exhibition'' said all their exhibits use unclaimed cadavers, deposited at the University of Dalian by Chinese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687 |title=NPR Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, a settlement with the attorney general of New York obliged Premier Exhibitions to offer refunds to visitors when it could not prove consent for the use of the bodies in its exhibitions. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo commented: "Despite repeated denials, we now know that Premier itself cannot demonstrate the circumstances that led to the death of the individuals. Nor is Premier able to establish that these people consented to their remains being used in this manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Cuomo Settlement With 'Bodies...

'''Catherine Amelia Fay Ewing''' (née '''Catherine Amelia Fay'''; nickname, Aunt Katy; July 18, 1822 - April 4, 1897) was an American educator, missionary, philanthropist, activists, and social reformer from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Massachusetts]]. In 1857, she took in children from the [[Washington County, Ohio|Washington County]] Infirmary, thus organizing the first [[children's home]] in the state of [[Ohio]].{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} 

Ewing taught school in Ohio before becoming a missionary among the [[Choctaw]]. Ten years later, upon her return to Ohio, she founded a home for destitute children. Through her efforts, the [[Ohio Legislature]] passed a bill in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], which entitled every county to establish a children's home. Ewing also authored a comprehensive historical report on the origin and growth of the children's home movement in Washington County.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=280-81}}

==Early life and education==
Catherine A. Fay was born in [[Westboro, Massachusetts]], July 18, 1822. Her parents, William (a veteran of the [[War of 1812]]){{sfn|MacGrath|Reed|1892|p=369}} and Elizabeth (Lankton) Fay,&lt;ref name="marietta.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuscripts|url=http://library.marietta.edu/spc/collections/manuscripts.html|publisher=Marietta College|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; lived comfortably. She was the seventh of eleven children, of whom all grew up and nine reached an advanced age.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} On her father's side, Ewing was descended from [[Huguenot]] ancestry. Through the mother's influence, the 12 children became Christians in early life. Ewing's mother was of Scotch descent, and in the long line of Christian ancestors, there were many ministers and missionaries.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=280-81}}

In 1835, the family removed to Washington County, Ohio, and settled {{convert|1|mile}} east of [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]], near [[Marietta College]]. The father came here both to aid the struggling college and to give his sons the benefit of its advantages.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} Ewing attended the Marietta Female Seminary,&lt;ref name="marietta.eduDiary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catharine (Fay) Ewing Diary, Marietta College Library|url=http://library.marietta.edu/spc/FindingAids/Ewing%20-%20Catharine%20Fay%20Ewing%20Diary.pdf|publisher=Marietta College Library|accessdate=14 March 2017|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining in Marietta through her girlhood, even as her health began to decline.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}}

==Career==
===Educator and missionary===
Ewing offered herself to the American Board for Foreign Mission work among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who were at that time included in the field of the Board's activities. She was 18 when she left home and became a mission teacher among the [[Choctaw]], who had been removed in 1830 from their homes in the South to [[Indian Territory]]. Her salary as a teacher was US$100 a year plus her board. For 10 years, she labored among the Choctaw, much of the time the only non-Native American among them, living {{convert|40|miles}} beyond the nearest post office.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} 

In the fall of 1853, while working as a missionary among the Choctaw, a physician called upon Ewing and asked her to visit a poor family where the mother, a [[New England]] woman, had died leaving five small children. They had been committed to his care, and he was trying to find homes for them, their drunken father having deserted them. The physician wanted Ewing to adopt a little girl who as two years old. She took the youngest for a little while, and became deeply attached to the child,{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} but she felt the decision was impracticable as she was a poor teacher, hundreds of miles from home. The child was then taken by a married couple. Following a drunken fight, the child was thrown down the steps of the house and killed. This affected Ewing so deeply that she became determined to have a home of her own where she could care for orphan and homeless children. To achieve this objective, she began saving every dollar possible.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} Eventually, however, [[malaria]] and nervous exhaustion compelled her return to Marietta.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}}

===Philanthropist===
Her father, sympathizing with her purpose, assisted Ewing to some extent, so from these and other sources she gathered a modest amount from sympathetic friends, borrowed $150, till her resources amounted to $500. In 1857, she purchased {{convert|12|acres}} of land at [[Moss Run, Ohio|Moss Run]], about {{convert|15|miles}} east of Marietta, and set about building.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}}  Meanwhile, soon after her return from the missionary work, she had chanced to visit the county infirmary, and was drawn to the young children there, living in the same environment with adults. These children were often diseased and depraved, but she fell in love with them nonetheless, and determined to make for them a home. Many thought her crazy, others suspected a moneymaking scheme, some appreciated her motives and sacrifices and helped her.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} 

On 1 April, 1858, in a cottage of two rooms, she received from the County Poor House, nine children, all under 10 years of age. The county agreed to pay her $1.00 a week (''The Marietta Register'' said the sum was $0.75 cents a week) and half the expense of medical attendance and burial in case of death. Each child was to have a new suit of clothes when brought to her, but for all other needs she was herself to be responsible.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} 
 
The first few weeks were very hard ones, the trustees of the district school refusing to allow the children to attend school because they were paupers, and they were unwilling to have their own children associate with them. After a lawsuit, she obtained permission to send them to school, but the children were taunted as poorhouse children.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} A few months later, before the ensuing winter, she moved into the new home with 20 rooms, and the first children’s home was an accomplished fact.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} Its cost was $2000, and in five years, $4000 had been expended on the property.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} She also built her own school house and engaged a teacher.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} 

After the [[American Civil War]] broke out in 1861, many soldiers' children were added to her care. Her allowance for the increased cost of living was brought up to $1.25 a week and in response to her appeal for such children, the State opened at [[Xenia, Ohio]] a home for soldiers' orphans. For 10 years, she successfully managed the home and cared for 101 needy children of Washington County.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} She faced problems of feeding and clothing so many, especially in war times, when prices went up and the attention of those who had helped her before was drawn away. There was also the issue of sickness when [[diphtheria]] and [[scarlet fever]] invaded the home.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}}

===Activist===
But Ewing knew that the need of other counties was as great and some even greater. As early as 1862, she began an "agitation" for a State law in behalf of neglected children. She personally went to Columbus and pleaded with the Legislature.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} In 1864, she conferred with the commissioners about the process at the state legislature to bring about this change. The bill was presented that year, but failed. In 1865, it was again presented and rejected.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} Finally in 1866, a bill prepared by Hon. Samuel S. Knowles of Washington County was passed, authorizing the County Commissioners throughout the State to establish children's homes.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}} So the plan which she at first thought of only as a relief to her own Children's Home became in the course of time the means of creating homes in the different counties of the State.{{sfn|United States. Office of Education|1905|p=1309-10}} 

Washington County was one of the first to act under this law and a farm of {{convert|100|acres}} was purchased for this purpose. When all was ready for the children's arrival, she was asked to take the Superintendency of the home, in 1870. But she declined the offer as she had married by then.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}}

==Personal life==
In 1866, at the age of 44,&lt;ref name="marietta.eduDiary" /&gt; she married Archibald S. D. Ewing (1828-1900), who had been an adviser and assistant on her farm. After 1867, she lived quietly in Marietta, still active in good works. For many years, she taught the primary department of the Presbyterian Sunday School, and was “Aunt Katie” to a large part of the children and young people in the upper part of the city. She was interested in the temperance cause.{{sfn|Byers|1897|p=3-5}} 

Though the Ewings had no natural children, Mrs. Ewing had adopted five. She died April 4, 1897, leaving her property by will to the Missionary Society of the women of Marietta but this society had a temporary existence and had disbanded at the time of the death of her husband, so by direction of the Probate Court it was divided among her brothers and sisters and their heirs.{{sfn|Johnson|1913|p=69-73}}

'''Clan Mother''' is a traditional role of elder [[matriarch]] women within certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[clan]]s, who was typically in charge of appointing [[tribal chief]]s and [[Faithkeeper]]s.

== Hopi Clan Mothers ==
The [[Hopi people|Hopi]] (in what is now the [[Hopi Reservation]] in northeastern Arizona), according to Alice Schlegel, had as its "gender ideology&amp;nbsp;... one of female superiority, and it operated within a social actuality of sexual equality."&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', in ''Quarterly Journal of Ideology: "A Critique of the Conventional Wisdom"'', vol. VIII, no. 4, 1984, p. 44 and see pp. 44–52 (essay based partly on "seventeen years of fieldwork among the Hopi", per p. 44 n. 1) (author of Dep't of Anthropology, Univ. of Ariz., Tucson).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diana LeBow (based on Schlegel's work), in the Hopi, "gender roles&amp;nbsp;... are egalitarian&amp;nbsp;.... [and] [n]either sex is inferior."&lt;ref&gt;LeBow, Diana, ''Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi'', ''op. cit.'', p. [8].&lt;/ref&gt; LeBow concluded that Hopi women "participate fully in&amp;nbsp;... political decision-making."&lt;ref&gt;LeBow, Diana, ''Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi'', ''op. cit.'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schlegel, "the Hopi no longer live as they are described here"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p44n1"&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', ''op. cit.'', p. 44 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the attitude of female superiority is fading".&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p44n1" /&gt; Schlegel said the Hopi "were and still are matrilinial"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p45"&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', ''op. cit.'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Matrilineality]], a system in which descent is traced through maternal ancestors}} and "the household&amp;nbsp;... was matrilocal".&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p45" /&gt;{{Efn|[[Matrilocal residence]], a system in which a married couple live with or near the wife's parents}}

Schlegel explains why there was female superiority as that the Hopi believed in "life as the highest good&amp;nbsp;... [with] the female principle&amp;nbsp;... activated in women and in Mother Earth&amp;nbsp;... as its source"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p50" /&gt; and that the Hopi "were not in a state of continual war with equally matched neighbors"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p49"&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', ''op. cit.'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and "had no standing army"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p49" /&gt; so that "the Hopi lacked the spur to masculine superiority"&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p49" /&gt; and, within that, as that women were central to institutions of clan and household and predominated "within the economic and social systems (in contrast to male predominance within the political and ceremonial systems)",&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p49" /&gt; the Clan Mother, for example, being empowered to overturn land distribution by men if she felt it was unfair,&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p50"&gt;Schlegel, Alice, ''Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority'', ''op. cit.'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; since there was no "countervailing&amp;nbsp;... strongly centralized, male-centered political structure".&lt;ref name="Schlegel-HopiGenderIdeoFemaleSuper-p50" /&gt;

== Iroquois Clan Mothers ==
The [[Iroquois]] clan mother is responsible for the welfare of the clan. She names all the people of the clan and holds a position in nominating, installing and removing the male chief, the ''Hoyaneh'' ("Caretaker of the Peace"). They are considered the life givers. Each clan mother has a Faithkeeper who is responsible for ceremonial preparations, weddings, funerals, and other rituals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rain.org/campinternet/american-history/iroquois-role-of-clan-mother.html&lt;/ref&gt; The clan mother's position is hereditary; her title rests within the clan and is usually passed on to her female relatives, looking first at her eldest sisters, other sisters, then her eldest daughter and other daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Kemsley, [http://moondance.org/1997/winter97/nonfiction/shenando.html MATRIARCH: An Iroquois Celebration of Womanhood]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mohawk language|Kanien'kéha]] word for clan mother, ''Oiá:ner'', translates to English as "righteous" or "she is good". The Iroquois had 9 clans divided into three elements. The land element was represented by the wolf, deer and bear clans; the air element by the heron, snipe and hawk clans; and the water element by the beaver, eel and turtle clans.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Jennifer ''A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory'' Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic unit of the traditional Haudenosaunee society was the clan forming "firesides" of a husband, wife and their children; a typical clan in a village would number between 50-200 people.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=21}} Every clan was divided into two groups called ''moeities'' which carried out various rituals.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=21}} Every clan was headed by a clan mother.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=21}} Some of the most famous Haudenosaunee leaders have been clan mothers, most notably the half-French Madam Montour and her daughter French Margaret and her granddaughter Queen Esther.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=39-41}}

The Haudenosanuee League was founded according to their legends by a prophet known as the [[Great Peacemaker]] who brought the Five Nations together sometime in the 12th century, and since his first convert was a woman named [[Jigonhsasee]] and generally his first followers were women, the institution of the clan mothers was a tribute to this aspect of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Jennifer ''A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory'' Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 pages 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Haudenosaunee legend, before the Great Peacemaker, what became the Five Nations were dominated by a brutal struggle between an all-male, cannibal cult called the "Hunters" vs. the all-female society of farmers called the "Cultivators".{{sfn|Mann|1997|p=431}} In the story, not all the men joined the cannibal cult, and instead stand by their women, revering the "corn mothers" (another term for clan mother) who knew how to farm, and defeat the cannibal cult.{{sfn|Mann|1997|p=433}} In tribute to Jigonhasee's work and his other female followers, the Great Peacemaker had decreed that men and women were to be equal and the clan mothers were to choose the leaders of the League.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Jennifer ''A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory'' Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Haudenosaunnee, the universe was divided into two halves that needed each other to co-exist as for them, the concept of east was meaningless without the west and the concept of the west was meaningless without the east.{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=124}} In this way of understanding the universe, male and female were different aspects of the world that needed each other to co-exist in order for the world to continue, and as such, women were seen as the equals of men.{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=124}} The councils of the clan mothers, whose powers were equal to the councils of the chiefs, were a way of balancing out the male and female to achieve social harmony.{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=124}} One Iroquois told the American author Jeanette Rodriguez: "Within our society, we maintain a balance between the responsibilities of the women, the responsibilities of men, of the chiefs and of the faithkeepers. All of our men in between have to keep this balance so that at no time and no place does anyone have more power than the rest; for our leadership to function, all must have equal power. They must speak to one another".{{sfn|Rodrigeuz|2017|p=50}} In Haundenosaunee mythology, it was the Sky Woman who came from the Sky world inhabited by the supernatural beings who fell from the Sky world down to what became the earth, and who is the mother of all life in this world, thus making women more worthy of respect.{{sfn|Rodriquez|2017|p=24-29}} For the Haudenosaunee, it was the Sky woman who created all life on the earth, and women as the bearers of life, are seen as her heirs, being seen as spiritually part of the "mother earth" that nurtures all life.{{sfn|Rodriquez|2017|p=33 &amp; 55}} The Sky woman was considered to be the First Clan Mother, and her daughter, the Lynx Woman, the Second Clan Mother.{{sfn|Mann|1997|p=438}} Since Turtle Island (i.e. North America) was created for the Sky Woman when she fell to the earth, the Haudenosuanee traditionally gave ownership of the land to women.{{sfn|Mann|1997|p=438}}

Reflecting this identification of "mother earth" with the feminine, for the Haudenosaunee farming was strictly women's work, and the staple crops of corn, squash and beans were known as the "Three Sisters".{{sfn|Rodriquez|2017|p=33-34}} One of the laws credited to the Great Peacemaker declared that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The lineal descent of the People of the Five Nations shall run in the female line. Women shall be considered proprietors of the nation. They shall own the land and the soil. Men and women shall the status of the mother.{{sfn|Mann|1997|p=438}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the Haudenosaunee were by no means anti-male; in the Sky Woman story, the spirit of the North Wind seeks to seduce her teenage daughter, the Lynx Woman, by taking the forms of various animals until finally the North Spirit spirit takes a form she cannot resist, that of a handsome young man, and thereby fathers two twins.{{sfn|Mann|1997|p=431}} The 19th century American feminist [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] was greatly influenced by seeing the power of the clan mothers, which she deemed "mother rule" or a "matriarchate", and by their Haudenosaunee creation story, where it is a goddess who lives in harmony with nature rather than a patriarchal God who created all life in the world.{{sfn|Rodriquez|2017|p=8}}

Finally, the clan mothers conduct the cross-over ceremony which marks the end of childhood and the beginning of adolescence.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Jennifer page 50"&gt;Rodriguez, Jennifer ''A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory'' Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The cross-over ceremonies consists of much fasting, teaching, a period of seclusion and finally a ceremony involving singing and dancing that marks the symbolic beginning of adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Jennifer ''A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory'' Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The Haudenosaunee view life as consisting of several stages starting with conception itself with sex regarded as a sacred act that symbolically united the dual male and female aspects of the universe in order to create new life.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Jennifer ''A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory'' Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex is often described by the Haudenosaunnee as the sacred "Rite of Conception" that begins new life, and for the Haudenosaunee the Christian concept of Jesus's virgin birth is bizarre.{{sfn|Rodriquez|2017|p=52}} Birth is viewed as the second stage of life, with the clan mothers formally welcoming the newly born child into the world.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Jennifer page 53"&gt;Rodriguez, Jennifer ''A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory'' Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of "toothlessness" when toddlers grow their teeth is seen as the end of infancy and the beginning of childhood, which is the third stage of life.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Jennifer page 53"/&gt; The crossover ceremonies marking the end of childhood and the beginning of first adolescence and then the end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood are seen as the fourth and fifth states of life.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Jennifer page 50"/&gt; The cross-over ceremonies involved much fasting over a 20-day period, and clan mothers generally provide advice and encouragement to the young people undergoing the fast.{{sfn|Rodriquez|2017|p=50-52}} During the fasting phrase of the cross-over ceremonies, clan mothers often provide advice and encouragement to the fasting young people.{{sfn|Rodriquez|2017|p=50}}

Historically, the clan mothers selected the 50 sachems who ran the Haudenosaunee League that comprised the Five Nations of the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca, and who became the Six Nations when the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, James ''Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman'', Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The clan mothers would consult other senior women in her clan before naming a chief.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=1010}} The clans formed the local government in the League, and most importantly, the clans cut across the differences between the Five Nations as each of the Five Nations were divided into the 9 clans.{{sfn|Mann|1997|p=439}} The clan mothers also had the power to dismiss any chief or sachem who was felt to be falling in his duties, though the clan mother had to give three warnings first.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Jennifer ''A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory'' Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the clan mothers to name and dismiss chiefs ensured that a female perspective was always maintained on political decisions.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=1010-1011}} Anyone seeking to be adopted into an Haudenosaunee family had to approved by the clan mothers.{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=127}} When the Tuscarora joined the League, they had petition the clan mothers of the Five Mothers for permission to join, starting in 1711, and it was not until 11 years in 1722 that permission was finally granted.{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=127-128}} The Iroquois call themselves the Haudenosaunee ("the people of the longhouse") and reject the name Iroquois, which was the derogatory name given to them by the Algonquins meaning the "killer people". As the French were in contact with the Algonquins before they met the Haudenosaunee, the French adopted the Algonquin name for them, much to the chagrin of the Haudenosaunee, who consider the name Iroquois to be offensive.

The clan mothers were in charge of the various clans that made up the Iroquois League and as the Iroquois were a matrilateral society this meant that children were born into their mother's clan (i.e. if a woman belonged to the bear clan, then all her children belonged to the bear clan).&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, James ''Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman'', Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered to be incest by the Iroquois to marry within one's own matrilineal clan so traditionally marriages were between clans.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, Thomas "On Iroquois Incest" pages 29-43 from ''Anthropologica'', Volume 10, Issue 1, 1968 pages 30-34&lt;/ref&gt; Marrying someone from the same patrilineal clan was considered acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, Thomas "On Iroquois Incest" pages 29-43 from Anthropologica, Volume 10, Issue 1, 1968 pages 30-34&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the clan mothers was often missed by Europeans in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, who coming from patriarchal societies, tended to assume that the chiefs and sachems had the same powers as European kings, which was not the case.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Barbara Mann has charged that the impression that the councils of the clan mothers was "secondary" to the councils of the chiefs is a misunderstanding caused by Europeans who could not understand the gender equality in Iroquois society, and in fact the councils were equal.{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=123}} The councils of the clan mothers met the councils of the chiefs at least every month under a full moon, but meetings could be held more frequently if there was an emergency.{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=127}} The American scholar Elisabeth Tooker denied the popular claim that the Haudenosaunee League inspired the U.S. constitution of 1787, noting the U.S. constitution did not allow women to vote or hold office until 1920, and even today there is no guaranteed female representation in the executive, legislative or judicial arms of the U.S. government; in short, there is no counterpart to the clan mothers within the American system of governance.{{sfn|Tooker|1988|p=312}}

The clan mothers traditionally launched the "mourning wars" to take captives who would become Haudenosaunee by being adopted by a family to replace a family member who had died or alternatively be tortured to death, by announcing that a family was grieving because of a death of a family member and accused the young men in their villages of being cowards.&lt;ref name="Richter pages 528-559"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528-559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 532&lt;/ref&gt; At which point, the young men could either go on the war path by taking part in a "mourning war" or be branded cowards, which would make then unmarriageable.&lt;ref name="Richter pages 528-559"/&gt; Usually in order to prove their courage, the young men would take up the challenge issued by the clan mothers by going on a "mourning war".

A sign of the power of the clan mothers occurred in 1713 when a delegation representing the [[German Palatines|Palatines]] of 6 men had to ask a meeting of the council of clan mothers for permission to settle in Kanienkeh ("the land of the flint"-the Iroquois name for their homeland in what is now upstate New York), as only the clan mothers had that power.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, James Joseph Brant and his world, Toronto: James Lorimer &amp; Company, 2008 page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Palatine delegates and their interpreter had been expecting to meet the sachems, and were surprised to be meeting the clan mothers instead. The Canadian historian D. Peter MacLeod writing about the relationship between the Canadian  Iroquois and the French in the time of the Seven Years' War wrote: "Most critically, the importance of clan mothers, who possessed considerable economic and political power within Canadian Iroquois communities, was blithely overlooked by patriarchal European scribes. Those references that do exist, show clan mothers meeting in council with their male counterparts to take decisions regarding war and peace and joining in delegations to confront the ''Onontio'' [the Iroquois term for the French governor-general] and the French leadership in Montreal, but only hint at the real influence wielded by these women".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Significantly, the famous Mohawk chief [[Joseph Brant]] did not acquire political power despite his successes as a Loyalist commander in the American Revolutionary War until he married his third wife, Adonwentishon (also known as Catherine Croghan), who was a clan mother in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, James ''Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman'', Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 pages 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after Brant's marriage to the clan mother Adonwentishon that Brant become politically powerful within the Iroquois League, and his power rested on the fact that his wife was the clan mother of the turtle clan.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, James ''Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman'', Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Before then, the political power in the Brant family had been Joseph Brant's sister, [[Molly Brant]], who was a clan mother of the wolf clan.&lt;ref name="Paxton, James page 43"&gt;Paxton, James ''Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman'', Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Brant was the second common-in-law wife of Sir William Johnson, the superintendent of northern Indian affairs with the first being  a Palatine named Catherine Weisenberg. Brant had been in a relationship with Johnson from her teenage years on, and after Weisenberg died in 1759, promptly moved into Johnson's house to become the lady of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, James ''Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman'', Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Weisenberg, Brant featured prominently in Johnson's letters as his strong-willed and much younger wife, who managed both Johnson Hall and assisted his work.&lt;ref name="Paxton, James page 25"&gt;Paxton, James ''Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman'', Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In common with clan mothers, Brant was never deferential to her husband and insisted on attending political meetings with British leaders as befitting her status, where she was outspoken in defense of her people's best interests.&lt;ref name="Paxton, James page 25"/&gt; Molly Brant like her brother was a Loyalist, and was considered by the British to be one of their most powerful allies within the Iroquois League, able because of her position as a clan mother to rally the Iroquois warriors to fight for the Crown against the Americans despite the wishes of many Iroquois to be neutral in the war.&lt;ref name="Paxton, James page 43"/&gt; [[Daniel Claus]], an agent for the Indian Department wrote that "one word from her is more taken notice of by the Five Nations than a thousand from any white man without exception".&lt;ref name="Paxton, James page 43"/&gt;

Regarding the role of women in Iroquois society, [[Doug George-Kanentiio]] (2000) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function. ... We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong. ... The young women received formal instruction in traditional planting. ... Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people. ... In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used. ... In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review....Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women ''clan-mothers''. ... As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate. ... Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.''&lt;ref&gt;Doug George-Kanentiio, Iroquois Culture &amp; Commentary, New Mexico, Clear Light Publishers, 2000, pp. 53–55 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop''' (1847 – September 11, 1892) was an American social reformer and autobiographer.{{sfn|Davis|1989|p=151}} Her prominence came from her remarkable experience, being confined and unlawfully imprisoned in the [[Utica Lunatic Asylum]] for 26 months (October 1880 – December 1882),{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=75}} through a plot of a secret enemy to kill her. She eventually managed to communicate with [[James Bailey Silkman]], a lawyer who, like herself, was confined in the same asylum under similar circumstances. He succeeded in obtaining a [[writ]] of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and Judge [[George G. Barnard]] of the [[New York Supreme Court]] pronounced Lathrop sane and unlawfully incarcerated.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=598}}

After that time, she devoted her life to ameliorating the laws relating to lunacy.{{sfn|American Woman Suffrage Association|1892|p=170}} Lathrop felt she owed it to women to take her case before the [[New York State Legislature]], and demand reform in this direction, but she was unsuccessful in two efforts and found herself penniless and facing the need to support herself. After several efforts, she became a [[court stenographer]], and ten years after her release, wrote a book, the story of her own institutionalization, entitled ''[[A Secret Institution]].'' Published at her own expense,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; this book led to the formation of the Lunacy Law Reform League, in 1889, a national organization with headquarters in [[New York City]], of which Lathrop became the secretary and was the national organizer.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=598}}

==Early years and education==
Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop was born in [[Rochester, New York]]. She was a daughter of Gen. William E. Lathrop, a Brigadier General of the National Guard. Lathrop’s father had met and married Lathrop’s mother, Jemima, at the age of 42 – Jemima was only 19.  Lathrop had been one of five children, but had lost her eldest brother to disease in 1865 and her second eldest brother moved to the southern part of the country to look for work.  Lathrop’s father passed away in 1877 leaving his wife, and his three daughters to open their home to board strangers for income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She graduated from the Rochester Academy.

Lathrop also often traveled significant distances and visited friends around Rochester.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=Chapter II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Teacher===
Lathrop became a teacher, which, owing to her father's failure in business, became a means of support to her family as well as to herself. She continued to teach successfully until her unlawful imprisonment in the Utica State Hospital (formerly known as the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica).{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nysasylum.com/utica/ushhist.htm|title=Utica State Hospital|website=nysasylum.com|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utica Lunatic Asylum incarceration and release===
Lathrop feared that Miss Hamlo, a boarder in her mother's house, was poisoning her. Lathrop was obsessed with a Mr. Zell, a former lover who married another woman after Lathrop rejected him. After repenting her decision to reject Zell, Lathrop became convinced that Hamlo was in alliance with Zell's wife. After Lathrop began seeing Zell eveywhere, she believed he had divorced, and would now marry her if Lathrop survived Hamlo's poisonings.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=75}} When Lathrop's life was saved on two occasions by friends, she took some of the [[Aconitine|aconite]]-poisoned tea to a chemist for analysis, as she sought reliable proof before making open charges against any one. At the instigation of a doctor who was in sympathy with the plot to incarcerate Lathrop, she went to Utica to consult Dr. [[John P. Gray (psychiatrist)|John P. Gray]], Superintendent of the State Lunatic Asylum in [[Utica, New York]]. Instead of seeing Grey, upon her arrival, she was incarcerated with the insane, without the commitment papers required by law, and kept a prisoner at the asylum for 26 months.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}

She was sent to the asylum at the insistence of her mother and sisters, who lived in Rochester, and who asserted that Lathrop was suffering from the delusion that somebody was trying to poison her. Her answer was that it was not a delusion, that somebody was endeavoring to poison her. But she was willing to accept proof to the contrary, which was also evidence that there was no delusion. Nonetheless, her incarceration ensued.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;  By the time Lathrop was admitted to the asylum, she was 32 years old and unmarried despite engagements to two different men.  Her first engagement was broken off by her fiancé due to cold feet and her second betrothed died from consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hospital, according to Lathrop was “a living tomb.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few weeks of her arrival at Utica, Lathrop had written letters to two of her physician friends only to find out later that her letters had never been mailed.  The attending physician claimed they were not sent because the asylum was not obliged to send her letters “all over the country.”  Lathrop was “amazed and dumbfounded” at the idea that not only would her letters be read by the asylum doctors, but that they would never reach their intended destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lathrop had easily made a friend who had revealed to her how she would be able to communicate to the outside world without getting caught by the authorities. She obtained paper through another patient who had hidden the contraband in her room. The woman would not out rightly give the paper to Lathrop for fear of punishment for aiding and abetting, but hinted that there was nothing she could do if Lathrop took a page or two while she was elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lathrop also wrote on newspaper edges and scraps of wrapping paper which she also hid in her skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, she managed to communicate with Silkman, a New York lawyer, who had been forcibly carried off and imprisoned in the same insane asylum. He obtained a writ of ''habeas corpus'' at once on behalf of Lathrop, and in December, 1882, Judge Barnard of the New York Supreme Court pronounced Lathrop to be sane and unlawfully incarcerated.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}

===Social reformer and autobiographer===
Immediately upon her release, Lathrop went before the New York State Legislature. She described her experience and the necessity for reform. After making another fruitless effort the succeeding year, she found herself homeless and penniless, and dependent upon a cousin's generosity for shelter and support, forced to begin her new life under the most difficult circumstances.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}[[File:A Secret Institution (1890).png|thumb|''A Secret Institution'' (1890)]]
Lathrop collected money for a charitable society on a commission, spending her evenings studying stenography and typewriting. She soon started a business of her own and was successful as a [[court stenographer]]. Ten years after her release, she wrote her book, ''A Secret Institution'', which was a history of her own life, written in the style of a novel, and descriptive of what she experienced or witnessed while an inmate of the Utica asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA450#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Woman of the Century: Fourteen Hundred-seventy Biographical Sketches Accompanied by Portraits of Leading American Women in All Walks of Life|last=Willard|first=Frances Elizabeth|last2=Livermore|first2=Mary Ashton Rice|date=1893|publisher=Moulton|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping true to her vow “to devote the rest of [her] life to the cause of the insane,” Lathrop formed the Lunacy Law Reform and the Anti-Kidnapping Leagues.  The Leagues provided legal services to asylum patients who felt they were victims of a corrupt legal system. The goal of the leagues was to “protect sane people from false imprisonment.”  Both groups had helped several individuals who had been unjustly incarcerated secure their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary|last=|first=|date=September 13, 1892|work=The New York Times Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunacy Law Reform League in 1889, was a national organization having its headquarters in [[New York City]], of which she was secretary and national organizer.
{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=451}} Lathrop spoke out against asylum abuses, and became a spokesperson for others incarcerated as insane.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=67}} She lived with self-doubt, fear, and suspicion, while trying to understand how incarceration affected her. She struggled with society's perceptions of her mental stability.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=68}}

Lathrop died in [[Saratoga, New York]], on September 11, 1892,{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}} and is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester.

==Legal case==
Albert Bach, legal counsel to Lathrop, held that the interesting point in the case was the question of the deprivation of Lathrop's postal rights while in the asylum. She was not permitted to have writing materials, and even though she succeeded in obtaining them, the asylum authorities disposed of her letters as they pleased. The claim was asserted that asylum managers have no such control over inmates as have prison managers; that the former institutions have more of the character of hospitals. Bach found nothing in the by-laws of the Utica asylum giving the right to this close supervision. He said that there were many instances of wrongful incarceration, and that justice would seem to dictate that inmates of asylums should have access to the mails. Even though much of it would be trash, it would be well worth while to endure that if information could be obtained to the release of a person improperly detained.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Will sue the aslym; Miss Lathrop alleges that she was wrongfully incarcerated.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/12/20/103287284.pdf|accessdate=11 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1890|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports suggested that Lathrop would bring a suit of U$25,000 damages against the management of the Utica State Insane Asylum. The grounds alleged were the wrongful detention of herself, and the seizure of her letters written to friends asking them to help her to regain her liberty. Lathrop’s lawyer gave the following statement of the scope of the lawsuit: &lt;blockquote&gt;Of course the main point is in regard to the interception of letters that she wrote to friends asking for assistance. If the managers of the asylums have the right to intercept letters, they have the power to shut a person entirely from the world, whether the person be insane or not. This is a difference between a criminal and a lunatic. In the case of a criminal he is in his position through his own fault, but the insane person is a patient, and deserves all possible consideration. If they stop a person’s letters, they virtually remove from that person the possibility of obtaining release. The suit is brought not so much for the sake of damages, as to test the point whether or not the managers of asylums have a right to enforce such a rule. I have become interested in the matter, and intend to follow it up and test the question thoroughly. One of the things I will do will be to write to the Postmaster General, asking if it would not be advisable in case we can prove that the authorities are wrong in prohibiting the forwarding of letters, to place free delivery boxes in all asylums, that the patients may have a chance to correspond without difficulty with their friends. I believe such a system would do away with much of the abuse that without doubt exists in many asylums, and would greatly lessen the chance of sane persons being held in confinement.{{sfn|Jerdone|1891|p=59}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Military Police Corps (United States)|United States Army Military Police Corps]] defines criminal intelligence in more detail; '''criminal intelligence''' is information gathered or collated, analyzed, recorded/reported and disseminated by law enforcement agencies concerning types of [[crime]], identified criminals and known or suspected criminal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm;jsessionid=2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ!99557122|title=Field Manual (FM) 3-19.50 - Police Intelligence Operations (2006)|work=rdl.train.army.mil|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720002859/https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm%3Bjsessionid%3D2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ%2199557122|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly useful when dealing with [[organized crime]]. Criminal intelligence is developed by using [[surveillance]], [[informant]]s, [[interrogation]], and [[research]], or may be just picked up on the "street" by individual [[police]] officers.

Some larger law enforcement agencies have a department, division or section specifically designed to gather disparate pieces of information and develop criminal intelligence. One of the most effective ways of applying criminal intelligence is first to record it (store in a [[computer]] system) which can be "mined" (searched) for specific information.

==US Army usage==
Criminal intelligence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CRIMINT is the result of the collection, analysis, and interpretation of all available information concerning known and potential [[criminal]] threats and vulnerabilities of supported organizations. Army law enforcement agencies are the primary liaison representatives of the Army to federal, state, local, and host nation (HN) agencies for exchanging police intelligence. They collect criminal intelligence (''CRIMINT'') and human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) within the provisions of applicable statutes and regulations. Army law enforcement agencies have the capability to analyze and disseminate collected time-sensitive information concerning a criminal threat against Army interests. The value of such intelligence cannot be overemphasized; it not only serves the purpose of police investigations, it also contributes to the development of countermeasures to safeguard Army personnel, materials, information, and other resources.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"&gt;FM 3-19.13 LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==CRIMINT Process==
The CRIMINT process is effective intelligence results from a series of interrelated activities. The intelligence process is a continuous process of collecting and converting data into [[intelligence]] products to be integrated into operations. The process consists of several phases with continuous evaluation and feedback at each phase and at the end of the process. With the minor modification of adding “reporting” to the second phase, the following text outlines the intelligence process as discussed in Army Regulation (AR) 525-13.

* CRIMINT planning and directing.
* CRIMINT collection and reporting.
* CRIMINT processing.
* Analysis and production.
* Dissemination and integration.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"/&gt;

== Criminal intelligence analysis ==
''Criminal intelligence analysis'' has been recognized by law enforcement as a useful support tool for over twenty-five years and is successfully used within the international community. International organizations, such as the International Police ([[INTERPOL]]), European Police ([[EUROPOL]]) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), and while there are many definitions of Criminal Intelligence Analysis in use throughout the world, the one definition agreed in June 1992 by an international group of twelve European INTERPOL member countries and subsequently adopted by other countries is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The identification of and provision of insight into the relationship between crime data and other potentially relevant data with a view to police and judicial practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071005230215/http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-10-05|title=International Police (INTERPOL) (2010)|work=interpol.int|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, criminal intelligence is a more intense or specific application towards investigations than [[criminology]].

== Criminal investigation analysis software ==
There are several techniques intended for criminal investigation analysis. One of them is [[link analysis]] which is dedicated to evaluate relationships between nodes. In this specific category there are several applications such as IBM i2 that provides integrated tools to support crime investigators and next-generation, single platforms as DataWalk that imports, integrates and links structured and unstructured data at massive scale for further visual analysis, investigation and collaboration.

{{About|dating violence in general|teen-specific dating violence|Teen dating violence}}
'''Dating abuse''' or '''dating violence''' is defined as the perpetration or threat of an act of [[violence]] by at least one member of an unmarried couple on the other member within the context of [[dating]] or [[courtship]]. It is also when one partner tries to maintain [[Abusive power and control|power and control over the other through abuse/violence]].  This abuse/violence can take a number of forms: [[sexual assault]], [[sexual harassment]], threats, physical violence, [[verbal abuse|verbal]], mental, or [[emotional abuse]], social sabotage, and [[stalking]].  It can include [[psychological abuse]], [[emotional blackmail]], [[sexual abuse]], [[physical abuse]] and [[psychological manipulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcd.ecitizen.gov.sg/FamilyNCommunitySupport/StopFamilyViolence/DatingViolence/WarningSignsOfAbusiveRelationship/ Family and Community Development @eCitizen. Warning Signs of Abusive Relationship]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating violence crosses all racial, age, economic and social lines.  The Center for Relationship Abuse Awareness describes dating abuse as a "pattern of abusive and coercive behaviors used to maintain power and control over a former or current intimate partner."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoprelationshipabuse.org/signs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Family &amp; Community Development support group at eCitizen in [[Singapore]] has described what it calls tell-tale signs of an abusive relationship.

==Profiles of abuser and victim==
Individuals of all walks of life can find themselves in an abusive relationship.  Abuse can occur regardless of the couple's age, race, income, or other demographic traits.  There are, however, many traits that abusers and victims share in common.  

The Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence describes abusers as being obsessively [[jealous]] and possessive, overly confident, having mood swings or a history of violence or temper, seeking to isolate their partner from family, friends and colleagues, and having a tendency to blame external stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence http://www.pavecentre.org.sg/&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, victims of relationship abuse share many traits as well, including: physical signs of injury, missing time at work or school, slipping performance at work or school, changes in mood or personality, increased use of drugs or alcohol, and increasing isolation from friends and family.&lt;ref name="Dating Violence, ACADV"&gt;[http://www.acadv.org/dating.html#signs Dating Violence, (ACADV)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Victims may [[Blame#Self-blame|blame]] themselves for any abuse that occurs or may [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the severity of the crime.  This often leads to victims choosing to stay in abusive relationships.

Strauss (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Murray A. (2005) "[http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB33R%20Women%27s%20Violence%20Toward%20Men.pdf Women's Violence Towards Men Is A Serious Social Problem]." In D.R. Loeske, et al., eds. ''Current controversies in family violence.'' Newbery Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that while men inflict the greater share of injuries in domestic violence, researchers and society at large must not overlook the substantial minority of injuries inflicted by women. Additionally, Strauss notes that even relatively minor acts of physical aggression by women are a serious concern:

:'Minor' assaults perpetrated by women are also a major problem, even when they do not result in injury, because they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men. [...] It will be argued that in order to end 'wife beating,' it is essential for women also to end what many regard as a 'harmless' pattern of slapping, kicking, or throwing something at a male partner who persists in some outrageous behavior and 'won't listen to reason.'

Similarly, [[Deborah Capaldi]] &lt;ref&gt;"quoted in Sacks, Glenn. (2009) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-sacks/researcher-says-womens-in_b_222746.html Researcher Says Women's Initiation of Domestic Violence Predicts Risk to Women]." on HuffingtonPost.com, 6 July 2009. URL retrieved 9 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that a 13-year longitudinal study found that a woman's aggression towards a man was equally important as the man's tendency towards violence in predicting the likelihood of overall violence: "Since much IPV [Intimate Partner Violence] is mutual and women as well as men initiate IPV, prevention and treatment approaches should attempt to reduce women's violence as well as men's violence. Such an approach has a much higher chance of increasing women's safety."  However, Capaldi's research only focused on at-risk youth, not women in general, and, therefore, may not apply to the entire population.

'''Deception''' is an act or statement which misleads, hides the truth, or promotes a belief, concept, or idea that is not true. It is often done for [[personal gain]] or advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/deception |title=Definition of 'deception' - English Dictionary |work=[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|Cambridge Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |accessdate=November 11, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/deceive |title=Definition of 'deceive' |work=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |accessdate=November 11, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deception can involve dissimulation, [[propaganda]], and [[sleight of hand]], as well as distraction, camouflage, or concealment. There is also [[self-deception]], as in [[bad faith]]. It can also be called, with varying subjective implications, beguilement, deceit, bluff, mystification, ruse, or subterfuge.

Deception is a major [[relational transgressions|relational transgression]] that often leads to feelings of [[betrayal]] and distrust between relational partners. Deception violates relational [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] and is considered to be a negative [[wikt:violation|violation]] of expectations. Most people expect friends, relational partners, and even strangers to be truthful most of the time. If people expected most conversations to be untruthful, talking and communicating with others would require distraction and misdirection to acquire reliable information. A significant amount of deception occurs between some [[Romance (love)|romantic]] and relational partners.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"&gt;Guerrero, L., Anderson, P., Afifi, W. (2007). Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships (2nd ed.). Los Angeles: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tort of deceit|Deceit and dishonesty]] can also form grounds for civil litigation in [[tort]], or [[contract law]] (where it is known as [[misrepresentation]] or [[fraudulent misrepresentation]] if deliberate), or give rise to criminal prosecution for [[fraud]]. It also forms a vital part of [[psychological warfare]] in [[denial and deception]].

==Types of deception==
[[File:Witkiewicz Deception of woman.jpg|thumb|''Deception of woman, with self-portrait'' by [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]], 1927 ([[National Museum, Warsaw]].]]

Deception includes several types of communications or omissions that serve to distort or omit the complete truth. Examples of deception range from false statements to misleading claims in which relevant information is omitted, leading the receiver to infer false conclusions.  For example, a claim that 'sunflower oil is beneficial to brain health due to the presence of omega-3 fatty acids' may be misleading, as it leads the receiver to believe sunflower oil will benefit brain health more so than other foods.  In fact, sunflower oil is relatively low in omega-3 fatty acids and is not particularly good for brain health, so while this claim is technically true, it leads the receiver to infer false information.  Deception itself is intentionally managing verbal or nonverbal messages so that the message receiver will believe in a way that the message sender knows is false. [[Intention|Intent]] is critical with regard to deception. Intent differentiates between deception and an honest mistake. The [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] explores the interrelation between communicative context and sender and receiver cognitions and behaviors in deceptive exchanges.

Some forms of deception include:
# '''[[Lie]]s''': making up information or giving information that is the opposite or very different from the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffith |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Griffith |year=2011 |title=The Book of Real Answers to Everything! - Why do people lie? |isbn=978-1-74129-007-3 |url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/why-do-people-lie/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Equivocation]]s''': making an indirect, ambiguous, or contradictory statement.
# '''[[Lying by omission|Concealments]]''': omitting information that is important or relevant to the given context, or engaging in behavior that helps hide relevant information.
# '''[[Exaggerations]]''': overstatement or stretching the truth to a degree.
# '''[[Minimisation (psychology)|Understatements]]''': minimization or downplaying aspects of the truth.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

Many people believe that they are good at deception, though this confidence is often misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Motives==
Buller and Burgoon (1996) have proposed three taxonomies to distinguish motivations for deception based on their Interpersonal Deception Theory:
* Instrumental: to avoid punishment or to protect resources 
* Relational: to maintain relationships or bonds
* Identity: to preserve “face” or the self-image &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buller |first=D. B. |last2=Burgoon |first2=J. K. |title=Interpersonal Deception Theory |journal=Communication Theory |volume=6 |issue=3 |year=1996 |pages=203–242 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.1996.tb00127.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - The Beguiling of Merlin.jpg|thumb|''[[The Beguiling of Merlin]]'', by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1874]]
Deception detection between relational partners is extremely difficult, unless a partner tells a blatant or obvious lie or contradicts something the other partner knows to be true. While it is difficult to deceive a partner over a long period of time, deception often occurs in day-to-day conversations between relational partners.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt; Detecting deception is difficult because there are no known completely reliable indicators of deception. Deception, however, places a significant cognitive load on the deceiver. He or she must recall previous statements so that his or her story remains consistent and believable. As a result, deceivers often leak important information both verbally and [[non verbal communication|nonverbally]].

Deception and its detection is a complex, fluid, and cognitive process that is based on the context of the message exchange. The [[interpersonal deception theory]] posits that interpersonal deception is a dynamic, iterative process of mutual influence between a sender, who manipulates information to depart from the truth, and a receiver, who attempts to establish the validity of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Buller &amp; Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; A deceiver's actions are interrelated to the message receiver's actions. It is during this exchange that the deceiver will reveal verbal and nonverbal information about deceit.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon &amp; Qin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has found that there are some cues that may be correlated with deceptive communication, but scholars frequently disagree about the effectiveness of many of these cues to serve as reliable indicators. Noted deception scholar Aldert Vrij even states that there is no nonverbal behavior that is uniquely associated with deception.&lt;ref name="Vrij, 2008"&gt;Vrij, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As previously stated, a specific behavioral indicator of deception does not exist. There are, however, some nonverbal behaviors that have been found to be correlated with deception. Vrij found that examining a "cluster" of these cues was a significantly more reliable indicator of deception than examining a single cue.&lt;ref name="Vrij, 2008"/&gt;

[[Mark G. Frank|Mark Frank]] proposes that deception is detected at the cognitive level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frank |first=M. G. |last2=O’Sullivan |first2=M. |last3=Menasco |first3=M. A. |year=2009 |chapter=Human Behavior and Deception Detection |editor-first=J. G. |editor-last=Voeller |title=Handbook of Science and Technology for Homeland Security |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |doi=10.1002/9780470087923.hhs299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lying requires deliberate conscious behavior, so listening to speech and watching body language are important factors in detecting lies.  If a response to a question has a lot disturbances, less talking time, repeated words, and poor logical structure, then the person may be lying. Vocal cues such as frequency height and variation may also provide meaningful clues to deceit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rockwell |first=P. A. |last2=Buller |first2=D. B. |last3=Burgoon |first3=J. K. |title=Measurement of deceptive voices: Comparing acoustic and perceptual data |journal=Applied Psycholinguistics |volume=18 |year=1997 |issue=4 |pages=471–484 |doi=10.1017/S0142716400010948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fear specifically causes heightened arousal in liars, which manifests in more frequent blinking, pupil dilation, speech disturbances, and a higher pitched voice. The liars that experience guilt have been shown to make attempts at putting distance between themselves and the deceptive communication, producing “nonimmediacy cues” These can be verbal or physical, including speaking in more indirect ways and showing an inability to maintain eye contact with their conversation partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zuckerman |first=M. |last2=DePaulo |first2=B. M. |last3=Rosenthal |first3=R. |title=Verbal and Nonverbal Communication of Deception |journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |volume=14 |year=1981 |issue= |pages=1–59 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60369-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cue for detecting deceptive speech is the tone of the speech itself. Streeter, Krauss, Geller, Olson, and Apple (1977) have assessed that fear and anger, two emotions widely associated with deception, cause greater arousal than grief or indifference, and note that the amount of stress one feels is directly related to the frequency of the voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Streeter |first=L. A. |last2=Krauss |first2=R. M. |last3=Geller |first3=V. |last4=Olson |first4=C. |last5=Apple |first5=W. |title=Pitch changes during attempted deception |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=35 |issue=5 |year=1977 |pages=345–350 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.5.345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camouflage==
{{Main|Camouflage}}
[[Image:Young red necked wallaby.jpg|thumb|upright|This [[wallaby]] has adaptive colouration which allows it to blend with its environment.]]
[[File:122-я танковая бригада.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Concealed force: members of 122nd Tank Brigade [[camouflage]] their [[T-34|T-34 tank]] with natural materials as they prepare for the [[Siege of Leningrad]], 1941]]
The [[camouflage]] of a physical object often works by breaking up the visual boundary of that object. This usually involves colouring the camouflaged object with the same colours as the background against which the object will be hidden. In the realm of deceptive [[half-truths]], camouflage is realized by 'hiding' some of the truths.

[[Military camouflage]] as a form of visual deception is a part of [[military deception]].

==Disguise==
{{Main|Disguise}}
A disguise is an appearance to create the impression of being somebody or something else; for a well-known person this is also called incognito. [[Passing (sociology)|Passing]] involves more than mere dress and can include hiding one's real manner of speech.

'''Example''':
* The fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] often disguised himself as somebody else to avoid being recognized.

In a more abstract sense, 'disguise' may refer to the act of disguising the nature of a particular proposal in order to hide an unpopular motivation or effect associated with that proposal. This is a form of political [[Spin (public relations)|spin]] or [[propaganda]]. ''See also'': '''rationalisation''' and '''transfer''' within the [[Propaganda#Techniques of propaganda generation|techniques of propaganda generation.]]

'''Example''':
* Depicting an act of war (an attack) as a "peace" mission or [[spin (public relations)|"spinning"]] a [[kidnapping]] as a [[protective custody]].

===Dazzle===
'''Example''':
* The defensive mechanisms of most [[octopuses]] to eject black [[ink]] in a large cloud to aid in escape from predators.
* The use by some Allied navies during [[World War II]] of [[Dazzle camouflage]] painting schemes to confuse observers regarding a naval vessel's speed and heading.

== Deception used by governments ==
The term "deception" as used by a government is typically frowned upon unless it’s in reference to military operations. The terms for the means by which governments employ deception are:

* [[wikt:subterfuge|Subterfuge]] - in the case of disguise and disguised movement
* [[Secrecy]] - in the fortification of communications and in the fortified concealing of documents. 
* [[Propaganda]] - somewhat controversial label for what governments produce in the way of controlled information and message in media documents and communications.
* [[Fake news]] - in criminal investigations, the delivery of information to the public, the deliberate transformation of certain key details.
* [[Misinformation]] - similar to the above, but unconfined to criminal investigations.
* [[Military secret]] - secrecy for military operations
** [[False flag]] - military operations that deal with deception as their main component.

==Simulation==
Simulation consists of exhibiting false information. There are three simulation techniques: [[mimicry]] (copying another model or example, such as non-poisonous snakes which have the colours and markings of poisonous snakes), fabrication (making up a new model), and distraction (offering an alternative model)

===Mimicry===
In the biological world, mimicry involves ''unconscious'' deception by similarity to another organism, or to a natural object. Animals for example may deceive predators or prey by [[visual]], [[Sound|auditory]] or other means.

===Fabrication===
To make something that appears to be something that it is not, usually for the purpose of encouraging an adversary to reveal, endanger, or divert that adversary's own resources (''i.e.'', as a [[decoy]]). For example, in [[World War II]], it was common for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to use hollow tanks made out of wood to fool German [[reconnaissance]] planes into thinking a large armor unit was on the move in one area while the real tanks were well hidden and on the move in a location far from the fabricated "dummy" tanks. Mock airplanes and fake airfields have also been created.

===Distraction===
To get someone's attention from the truth by offering [[bait (luring substance)|bait]] or something else more tempting to divert attention away from the object being concealed. For example, a security company publicly announces that it will ship a large gold shipment down one route, while in reality take a different route. A military unit trying to maneuver out of a dangerous position may make a [[feint attack]] or fake retreat, to make the enemy think they are doing one thing, while in fact they have another goal.

A seventeenth-century story collection, Zhang Yingyu's ''[[The Book of Swindles]]'' (ca. 1617), offers multiple examples of the bait-and-switch and fraud techniques involving the stimulation of greed in Ming-dynasty China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/search-results?keyword=book+of+swindles|title=Search Results - book of swindles - Columbia University Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In romantic relationships ==
Deception is particularly common within romantic relationships, with more than 90% of individuals admitting to lying or not being completely honest with their partner at one time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=T. |year=2001 |title=Lying to the one you love: The use of deceptions in romantic relationships |journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=107–129 |doi=10.1177/0265407501181005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three primary motivations for deception in relationships.
* Partner-focused motives: Using deception to avoid hurting the partner, to help the partner to enhance or maintain their [[self-esteem]], to avoid worrying the partner, and to protect the partner's relationship with a third party.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guthrie |first=J. |last2=Kunkel |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=Tell me sweet (and not-so-sweet) little lies: Deception in romantic relationships |journal=Communication Studies |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=141–157 |doi=10.1080/10510974.2012.755637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boon |first=S.

Although other, less common, partner-focused motives such as using to deception to evoke jealous reactions from their partner may have damaging effects on a relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sheets |first=V. L. |last2=Fredendall |first2=L. L. |last3=Claypool |first3=H. M. |year=1997 |title=Jealousy evocation, partner reassurance, and relationship stability: An exploration of the potential benefits of jealousy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=387–402 |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(97)00088-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Self-focused motives: Using deception to enhance or protect one’s own [[self-image]], maintain or establish their autonomy, avoid constrictions, unwanted activities, or impositions, shield themselves from [[anger]], [[embarrassment]], or [[criticism]], or resolve an argument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another common self-focused motive for deception, is a continuation of deception in order to avoid being caught in a previous deception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Self-focused deception is generally perceived as a more serious transgression than partner-focused deception, because the deceiver is acting for selfish reasons rather than for the good of the partner or relationship.
* Relationship-focused motives: Using deception to limit relationship harm by avoiding conflict or relational trauma.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Relationally motivated deception can be beneficial to a relationship, and other times it can be harmful by further complicating matters. Deception may also be used to facilitate the dissolution of an unwanted relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deception impacts the perception of a relationship in a variety of ways, for both the deceiver and the deceived. The deceiver typically perceives less understanding and intimacy from the relationship, in that they see their partner as  less empathetic and more distant.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DePaulo |first=B. M. |last2=Kashy |first2=D. A. |year=1998 |title=Everyday lies in close and casual relationships |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=63–79 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of deception can also result in feelings of distress for the deceiver, which become worse the longer the deceiver has known the deceived, as well as in longer-term relationships. Once discovered, deception creates feelings of detachment and uneasiness surrounding the relationship for both partners; this can eventually lead to both partners becoming more removed from the relationship or deterioration of the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In general, discovery of deception can result in a decrease in relationship satisfaction and commitment level, however, in instances where a person is successfully deceived, relationship satisfaction can actually be positively impacted for the person deceived, since lies are typically used to make the other partner feel more positive about the relationship.

In general, deception tends to occur less often in relationships with higher satisfaction and commitment levels and in relationships where partners have known each other longer, such as long-term relationships and marriage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In comparison, deception is more likely to occur in casual relationships and in dating where commitment level and length of acquaintanceship is often much lower.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rowatt |first=W. C. |last2=Cunninghan |first2=M. R. |last3=Druen |first3=P.

=== Infidelity ===
{{Main|Infidelity}}
Unique to exclusive romantic relationships is the use of deception in the form of infidelity. When it comes to the occurrence of infidelity, there are many individual difference factors that can impact this behavior. Infidelity is impacted by [[Attachment theory|attachment style]], relationship satisfaction, [[Executive functions|executive function]], [[sociosexual orientation]], personality traits, and [[Infidelity#Gender differences|gender]]. Attachment style impacts the probability of infidelity and research indicates that people with an insecure [[Attachment theory|attachment style]] (anxious or avoidant) are more likely to cheat compared to individuals with a secure attachment style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWall |first=C. N. |last2=Lambert |first2=N. M. |last3=Slotter |first3=E. B. |last4=Pond |first4=R. S. Jr. |last5=Deckman |first5=T. |last6=Finkel |first6=E. J. |last7=Luchies |first7=L. B. |last8=Fincham |first8=F.

Those with an insecure attachment style are characterized by not believing that their romantic partner can/will support and comfort them in an effective way, either stemming from a negative belief regarding themselves (anxious attachment style) or a negative belief regarding romantic others (avoidant attachment style). Women are more likely to commit infidelity when they are emotionally unsatisfied with their relationship whereas men are more likely to commit infidelity if they are sexually unsatisfied with their current relationship.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barta |first=W.

Executive control is a part of [[executive functions]] that allows for individuals to monitor and control their behavior through thinking about and managing their actions. The level of executive control that an individual possesses is impacted by development and experience and can be improved through training and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diamond |first=A. |last2=Lee |first2=K. |year=2011 |title=Interventions shown to aid executive function development in children 4 to 12 years old |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=333 |issue=6045 |pages=959–964 |doi=10.1126/science.1204529 |pmc=3159917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klingberg |first=T. |year=2010 |title=Training and plasticity of working memory |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=317–324 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those individuals that show a higher level of executive control can more easily influence/control their thoughts and behaviors in relation to potential threats to an ongoing relationship which can result in paying less attention to threats to the current relationship (other potential romantic mates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pronk |first=T.

In their study, men and women were equally likely to accept a sexual proposal from an individual who was speculated to have a high level of sexual prowess. Additionally, women were just as likely as men to accept a casual sexual proposal when they did not anticipate being subjected to the negative stigma of sexually permissible women as slutty.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Research on the use of deception in online dating has shown that people are generally truthful about themselves with the exception of physical attributes to appear more attractive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/close-encounters/201407/can-you-really-trust-the-people-you-meet-online|title=Can you really trust the people you meet online?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scienceofrelationships.com/home/2015/5/14/mythbusting-online-dating.html|title=Myth-busting online dating|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/let-their-words-do-the-talking/201111/detecting-deception-in-online-profiles|title=Detecting deception in online profiles|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Scientific American, “nine out of ten online daters will fib about their height, weight, or age” such that men were more likely to lie about height while women were more likely to lie about weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/catfishing-the-truth-about-deception-online/|title=Catfishing: The truth about deception online|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Toma and Hancock, “less attractive people were found to be more likely to have chosen a profile picture in which they were significantly more attractive than they were in everyday life”.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/dollars-and-sex/big-fat-liars-less-attractive-people-have-more-deceptive-online-dating-profiles|title=Big fat liars: Less attractive people have more deceptive online dating profiles|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both genders used this strategy in online dating profiles, but women more so than men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, less attractive people were more likely to have “lied about objective measures of physical attractiveness such as height and weight”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In general, men are more likely to lie on dating profiles the one exception being that women are more likely to lie about weight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==In social research==
Some methodologies in social research, especially in [[psychology]], involve deception. The researchers purposely mislead or misinform the participants about the true nature of the experiment. In an experiment conducted by [[Stanley Milgram]] in 1963 the researchers told participants that they would be participating in a scientific study of memory and learning. In reality the study looked at the participants' willingness to obey commands, even when that involved inflicting pain upon another person. After the study, the subjects were informed of the true nature of the study, and steps were taken in order to ensure that the subjects left in a state of well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgram|first=Stanley|title=Behavioral Study of Obedience|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1963|volume=67|issue=4|pages=371–378|doi=10.1037/h0040525|pmid=14049516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of deception raises many problems of [[research ethics]] and it is strictly regulated by professional bodies such as the [[American Psychological Association]].

==In psychological research==
Psychological research often needs to deceive the subjects as to its actual purpose. The rationale for such deception is that humans are sensitive to how they appear to others (and to themselves) and this self-consciousness might interfere with or distort from how they actually behave outside of a research context (where they would not feel they were being scrutinized). For example, if a psychologist is interested in learning the conditions under which students cheat on tests, directly asking them, "how often do you cheat?," might result in a high percent of "socially desirable" answers and the researcher would in any case be unable to verify the accuracy of these responses. In general, then, when it is unfeasible or naive to simply ask people directly why or how often they do what they do, researchers turn to the use of deception to distract their participants from the true behavior of interest. So, for example, in a study of cheating, the participants may be told that the study has to do with how intuitive they are. During the process they might be given the opportunity to look at (secretly, they think) another participant's [presumably highly intuitively correct] answers before handing in their own. At the conclusion of this or any research involving deception, all participants must be told of the true nature of the study and why deception was necessary (this is called debriefing). Moreover, it is customary to offer to provide a summary of the results to all participants at the conclusion of the research.

Though commonly used and allowed by the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association, there has been debate about whether or not the use of deception should be permitted in psychological research [[experiment]]s. Those against deception object to the ethical and methodological issues involved in its use. Dresser (1981) notes that, ethically, researchers are only to use subjects in an experiment after the subject has given informed consent. However, because of its very nature, a researcher conducting a deception experiment cannot reveal its true purpose to the subject, thereby making any consent given by a subject misinformed (p.&amp;nbsp;3). [[Diana Baumrind|Baumrind]] (1964), criticizing the use of deception in the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram (1963) obedience experiment]], argues that deception experiments inappropriately take advantage of the implicit trust and obedience given by the subject when the subject volunteers to participate (p.&amp;nbsp;421).

From a practical perspective, there are also methodological objections to deception. Ortmann and Hertwig (1998) note that "deception can strongly affect the reputation of individual labs and the profession, thus contaminating the participant pool" (p.&amp;nbsp;806). If the subjects in the experiment are suspicious of the researcher, they are unlikely to behave as they normally would, and the researcher's control of the experiment is then compromised (p.&amp;nbsp;807). Those who do not object to the use of deception note that there is always a constant struggle in balancing "the need for conducting research that may solve social problems and the necessity for preserving the dignity and rights of the research participant" (Christensen, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;670). They also note that, in some cases, using deception is the only way to obtain certain kinds of information, and that prohibiting all deception in research would "have the egregious consequence of preventing researchers from carrying out a wide range of important studies" (Kimmel, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;805).

Additionally, findings suggest that deception is not harmful to subjects. Christensen's (1988) review of the literature found "that research participants do not perceive that they are harmed and do not seem to mind being misled" (p.&amp;nbsp;668). Furthermore, those participating in experiments involving deception "reported having enjoyed the experience more and perceived more educational benefit" than those who participated in non-deceptive experiments (p.&amp;nbsp;668). Lastly, it has also been suggested that an unpleasant treatment used in a deception study or the unpleasant implications of the outcome of a deception study may be the underlying reason that a study using deception is perceived as unethical in nature, rather than the actual deception itself (Broder, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;806; Christensen, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;671).

==In philosophy==
Deception is a recurring theme in modern philosophy. In 1641 Descartes published his [[Descarte's meditations|meditations]], in which he introduced the notion of the [[Deus deceptor]], a posited being capable of deceiving the thinking [[wikt:ego|ego]] about [[reality]]. The notion was used as part of his [[hyperbolic doubt]], wherein one decides to doubt everything there is to doubt. The Deus deceptor is a mainstay of so-called [[skeptical]] arguments, which purport to put into question our knowledge of reality. The punch of the argument is that all we know might be wrong, since we might be deceived. [[Stanley Cavell]] has argued that all skepticism has its root in this fear of deception.

==In religion==
Deception is a common topic in religious discussions.  Some sources focus on how religious texts deal with deception.  But, other sources focus on the deceptions created by the religions themselves.  For example, Ryan McKnight is the founder of an organization called FaithLeaks.  He stated that the organizations "goal is to reduce the amount of deception and untruths and unethical behaviors that exist in some facets of religion".&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Graham, [https://slate.com/technology/2018/01/a-new-wikileaks-for-religion-publishes-its-first-trove-of-documents.html "A New “Wikileaks for Religion” Publishes Its First Trove of Documents"], ''Slate'', January 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In its purest form, [[Christianity]] encourages the pursuit of truth.  But, in practice, many Christians are criticized as being deceptive and otherwise problematic.  The prominent political speech writer [[Michael Gerson]] said that evangelicals were "associating evangelicalism with bigotry, selfishness and deception."  His comments were directed specifically towards those evangelicals who support Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Goldberg, [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/opinion/trump-christian-right-values.html "Of Course the Christian Right Supports Trump"], ''The New York Times'', January 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] the concept of Taqiyya is often interpreted as legitimized deception.  But, many Muslims view Taqiyya as a necessary means of alleviating religious persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Shakira Hussein, [http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/05/28/4244447.htm "The Myth of the Lying Muslim: 'Taqiyya' and the Racialization of Muslim Identity"], ''ABC'', May 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  In the city of [[Basking Ridge, New Jersey]] the town's residents used the concept of Taqivya to block a mosque from being built.  The dispute went on for years.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rice, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/08/how-to-stop-a-mosque-the-new-playbook-of-the-right "The fight for the right to be a Muslim in America"], ''The Guardian'', February 8, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  In a related story, journalist Ian Wilkie of [[Newsweek]] asserted that Taquivya provides evidence that Assad has used chemical weapons on the Syrian people.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wilkie, [http://www.newsweek.com/wheres-evidence-assad-used-sarin-gas-his-people-810123 "WHERE’S THE EVIDENCE ASSAD USED SARIN GAS ON HIS PEOPLE?"], ''Newsweek'', February 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law==
{{main|Tort of deceit}}
For legal purposes, [[tort of deceit|deceit]] is a [[tort]] that occurs when a person makes a factual misrepresentation, knowing that it is false (or having no belief in its truth and being reckless as to whether it is true) and intending it to be relied on by the recipient, and the recipient acts to his or her detriment in reliance on it.  Deceit may also be grounds for legal action in [[contract law]] (known as [[misrepresentation]], or if deliberate, [[fraudulent misrepresentation]]), or a criminal prosecution, on the basis of [[fraud]].

Roles that have been identified as requiring emotional labor include but are not limited to Mother/Wife, those involved in [[public administration]] (especially the palace intrigues of a ruling body, these being an eternal literary theme), guarded professions of secrecy (such as espionage, national security, military intelligence, psychiatry, clerisy, and law), [[flight attendant]], [[Day care|daycare worker]], [[Nursing home care|nursing home worker]], [[Nursing|nurse]], [[Physician|doctor]], [[Cashier|store clerk]], [[Call centre|call center worker]], [[teacher]], [[librarian]], [[social worker]]; most roles in a [[hotel]], [[motel]], [[tavern]], [[bar]], [[pub]], and [[restaurant]]; and jobs in the media, such as television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |contribution=Preface to the 2012 edition |editor-last=Russell Hochschild |editor-first=Arlie |editor-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title-link=The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling |title=The managed heart: commercialization of human feeling |page=x |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-520-27294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As particular economies move from a [[manufacturing]]- to a [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service-based economy]], more workers in a variety of occupational fields are expected to manage their emotions according to employer demands when compared to sixty years ago.

==Definition: emotional labor versus emotion work==
[[File:Waitress2k7.jpg|thumb|A [[waitress]] at a restaurant is expected to do emotional labor, such as smiling and expressing positive emotion towards customers]]

The [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]] provides the first definition of emotional labor, which is a form of emotion regulation that creates a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; The related term [[emotion work]] (also called "emotion management") refers to "these same acts done in a private context", such as within the private sphere of one's home or interactions with [[family]] and [[friendship|friends]]. Hochschild identified three emotion regulation strategies: [[cognitive]], bodily, and expressive.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title=Emotion work, feeling rules, and social structure |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=551–575 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |jstor=2778583 |date=November 1979 |ref=harv |doi=10.1086/227049}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within cognitive emotion work, one attempts to change images, ideas, or thoughts in hopes of changing the feelings associated with them.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may associate a family picture with feeling happy and think about said picture whenever attempting to feel happy. Within bodily emotion work, one attempts to change physical symptoms in order to create a desired [[emotion]].&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt deep breathing in order to reduce anger. Within expressive emotion work, one attempts to change expressive gestures to change inner feelings.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt to smile when trying to feel happy. One becomes aware of emotion work most often when one's feelings do not fit the situation. For instance, when one does not feel sad at a funeral, one becomes acutely aware of the feelings appropriate for that situation.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt;

While emotion work happens within the private sphere, emotional labor is emotion management within the workplace according to employer expectations. According to Hochschild (1983), the emotion management by employers creates a situation in which this emotion management can be exchanged in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; According to Hochschild (1983), [[Job (role)|jobs]] involving emotional labor are defined as those that:

# require face-to-face or voice-to-voice contact with the public.
# require the worker to produce an emotional state in another person.
# allow the employer, through training and supervision, to exercise a degree of control over the emotional activities of employees.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

Hochschild (1983) argues that within this [[commodification]] process, service workers are estranged from their own feelings in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

==Determinants==
# Societal, occupational, and organizational [[Norm (sociology)|norms]].

# Supervisory regulation of display rules; That is, supervisors are likely to be important definers of display rules at the job level, given their direct influence on worker's beliefs about high-performance expectations. Moreover, supervisors' impressions of the need to suppress negative emotions on the job influence the employees' impressions of that display rule.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"/&gt;

== Surface and deep acting ==
Original description of this emotion management process, researchers have focused on surface acting and deep acting as the primary strategies that employees use to regulate their emotions. Surface acting involves a "faking" process through which outward expressions are altered, yet internal feelings are left intact (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=The managed heart: The commercialization of feeling |last=Hochschild |first=A.R. |date=1983 |journal=University of California Press |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, deep acting is an effortful process through which employees change their internal feelings to align with organizational expectations, producing more natural and genuine emotional displays (Grandey et al., 2013)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse Perspectives on Emotion Regulation at Work |last=Grandy |first=A. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn= |location= |pages=3–17 |last2=Diefendorff |first2=J.M. |last3=Rupp |first3=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3). Although the underlying regulatory processes involved in each approach differ, the objective of both, is typically to show positive emotions, which are presumed to impact the feelings of customers and bottom-line outcomes (e.g., sales, positive recommendations, and repeat business; Pugh, 2001; Tsai, 2001).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, S.

==Careers==
[[File:Altenpflegerin D1824.jpg|thumb|A [[nurse]] working in a hospital, is expected to express positive emotions towards patients, such as warmth and compassion.]]

In the past, emotional labor demands and display rules were viewed as a characteristic of particular [[wikt:occupation|occupations]], such as [[waiting staff|restaurant workers]], [[cashier]]s, [[hospital]] workers, bill collectors, [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselors]], [[secretary|secretaries]], and nurses. However, display rules have been conceptualized not only as [[role]] requirements of particular occupational groups, but also as [[interpersonal]] job demands, which are shared by many kinds of occupations.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diefendorff |first1=J. M. |last2=Richard |first2=E. M. |year=2003 |title=Antecedents and consequences of emotional display rule perceptions |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.284 |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=284–294 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.284 |pmid=12731712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bill collectors ===
In 1991, Sutton did an in-depth [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] study into bill collectors at a [[collection agency]].&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert I. |last=Sutton |year=1991 |title=Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors |journal=[[Administrative Science Quarterly]] |issue=2 |volume=36 |pages=245–268 |jstor=2393355 |doi=10.2307/2393355 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2393355}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that unlike the other jobs described here where employees need to act cheerful and concerned, bill collectors are selected and [[socialized]] to show irritation to most [[debtor]]s.  Specifically, the collection agency hired agents who seemed to be easily aroused. The newly hired agents were then trained on when and how to show varying emotions to different types of debtors.  As they worked at the collection agency, they were closely monitored by their supervisors to make sure that they frequently conveyed urgency to debtors.

Bill collectors' emotional labor consists of not letting angry and hostile debtors make them angry and to not feel guilty about pressuring friendly debtors for money.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They coped with angry debtors by publicly showing their anger or making jokes when they got off the phone.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They minimized the guilt they felt by staying emotionally detached from the debtors.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt;

=== Food-industry workers ===

====Wait staff====
[[File:Waitress taking an order.jpg|thumb|A waitress taking an order in an American restaurant]]

In her 1991 study of [[waitresses]] in [[Philadelphia]], Paules examines how these workers assert control and protect their [[self identity]] during interactions with [[customers]]. In [[restaurant]] work, Paules argues, workers' subordination to customers is reinforced through "[[cultural]] symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about [[service sector|service work]]." Because the waitresses were not strictly regulated by their [[employers]], waitresses' interactions with customers were controlled by the waitresses themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the [[stereotypes]] and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, the waitresses studied were not negatively affected by their interactions with customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill that could be used to gain control over customers. Thus, the Philadelphia waitresses took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paules|first=G.F.|title=Dishing it out: power and resistance among waitresses in a New Jersey restaurant|year=1991|publisher=Temple University|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780877228875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Paules highlights the positive consequences of emotional labor for a specific population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of [[participant observation]] research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that [[casino]] waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bayard De Volo |first=L |title=Service and surveillance: infrapolitics at work among casino cocktail waitresses |journal=[[Social Politics|Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State &amp; Society]] |year=2003 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=346–376 |doi=10.1093/sp/jxg019 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sp/jxg019 }} [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/social_politics/v010/10.3de_volo.html Article at Project MUSE.]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping system]], both casino owners and customers control waitresses' [[behavior]] and [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management makes it difficult to change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress" /&gt;

====Fast-food employees====
By using participant observation and [[interview]]s, Leidner (1993) examines how employers in fast food restaurants regulate workers' interactions with customers.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leidner|first=Robin|title=Fast food, fast talk: service work and the routinization of everyday life|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520085008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leidner (1993), employers attempt to regulate workers' interactions with customers only under certain conditions. Specifically, when employers attempt to regulate worker-customer interactions, employers believe that "the quality of the interaction is important to the success of the enterprise", that workers are "unable or unwilling to conduct the interactions appropriately on their own", and that the "tasks themselves are not too complex or context-dependent."&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), regulating employee interactions with customers involves standardizing workers' personal interactions with customers. At the [[McDonald's]] fast food restaurants in Leidner's (1993) study, these interactions are strictly scripted, and workers' compliance with the scripts and regulations are closely monitored.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

Along with examining employers' attempts to regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' respond to these regulations.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage in some form of emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a [[smile]] and friendly attitude independent of their own [[mood (psychology)|mood]] or [[temperament]] at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used [[humor]] or [[exaggeration]] to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

===Physicians===
According to Larson and Yao (2005), [[empathy]] should characterize physicians' interactions with their patients because, despite advancement in medical [[technology]], the interpersonal relationship between [[physicians]] and [[patients]] remains essential to quality [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name=Physicians&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larson |first1=E.B. |last2=Yao |first2=X. |title=Clinical empathy as emotional labor in the patient-physician relationship |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|The Journal of the American Medical Association]] |year=2005 |volume=293 |issue=9 |pages=1100–1106 |pmid=15741532 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.9.1100 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.293.9.1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians consider empathy a form of emotional labor. Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in emotional labor through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional [[contentment|satisfaction]] when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.&lt;ref name=Physicians /&gt;

===Police work===
According to Martin (1999), [[police]] work involves substantial amounts of emotional labor by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion in the presence of other [[officers]] and [[citizens]].&lt;ref name="Police Officers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=S.E. |title=Police force or police service? Gender and emotional labor |journal=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science#The Annals|The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |year=1999 |volume=561 |issue=1 |jstor=1049285 |doi=10.1177/000271629956100108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically [[masculine]] work that focuses on fighting [[crime]], policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much [[anger]], [[sympathy]], or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work, due to the [[sexist]] views of many police officers.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt; While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt;

===Public administration ===
Many scholars argue that the amount of emotional work required between all levels of government is greatest on the local level. It is at the level of cities and counties that the responsibility lies for day to day emergency preparedness, firefighters, law enforcement, public education, public health, and family and children's services. Citizens in a community expect the same level of satisfaction from their government, as they receive in a [[customer service]]-oriented job. This takes a considerate amount of work for both employees and employers in the field of public administration. There are two comparisons that represent emotional labor within public administration, "Rational Work versus Emotion Work", and "Emotional Labor versus Emotional Intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=6–7 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance====

When public administrators perform emotional labor, many scholars argue administrators are dealing with significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The reason for this is because they are on the front lines of the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emotional Labor and Crisis Response, Working on a Razor's Edge|last=Mastracci|first=Sharron H.|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2012|isbn=|location=Armonk, New York|pages=20–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: rational work vs. emotion work ====
According to Mary Guy, Public administration does not only focus on the business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=63 |last2=Newman |last3=Mastracci |first2=Meredith |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: vs. emotional intelligence ====
Knowing how to suppress and manage one's own feelings is known as [[emotional intelligence]], the ability to control one's emotions and to be able to do this at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=64–65 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) use the term "emotional proletariat" to describe [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service jobs]] in which "workers exercise emotional labor wherein they are required to display friendliness and [[deference]] to customers."&lt;ref name="Gender Book"&gt;{{citation |last1=Macdonald |first1=Cameron L. |last2=Sirianni |first2=Carmen |contribution=The service society and the changing experience of work |editor1-last=Macdonald |editor1-first=Cameron L. |editor2-last=Sirianni |editor2-first=Carmen |title=In working in the service society |year=1996 |pages=1–28 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-480-2 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of deference, these occupations tend to be stereotyped as female jobs, independent of the actual number of women working the job. According to Macdonald and Sirianni (1996), because deference is a characteristic demanded of all those in [[disadvantaged]] structural positions, especially women, when deference is made a job requirement, women are likely to be overrepresented in these jobs. Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) claim that "[i]n no other area of wage labor are the personal characteristics of the workers so strongly associated with the nature of the work."&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt; Thus, according to Macdonald and Sirianna (1996), although all workers employed within the service economy may have a difficult time maintaining their [[dignity]] and self-identity due to the demands of emotional labor, such an issue may be especially problematic for women workers.&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt;

Emotional labor also affects women by perpetuating [[occupational segregation]] and the [[gender wage gap]].&lt;ref name="Gender Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guy|first1=Mary Ellen|last2=Newman|first2=Meredith A.|date=|year=2004|title=Women's jobs, men's jobs: sex segregation and emotional labor|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|journal=[[Public Administration Review]]|volume=64|issue=3|pages=289–298|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job segregation, which is the systematic tendency for men and women to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap can at least be partially attributed to emotional labor. Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and [[empathy|empathizing]] are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations: "Excluded from job descriptions and performance evaluations, the work is invisible and uncompensated. Public service relies heavily on such skills, yet civil service systems, which are designed on the assumptions of a bygone era, fail to acknowledge and compensate emotional labor." According to Guy and Newman (2004), women working in positions that require emotion labour in addition to regular work are not compensated for this additional labour because of the sexist notion that the additional labour is to be expected of them by the fact of being a woman. This suggests that Guy and Newman believe a man conducting emotional labour would be compensated more than a woman would, however, if women are inproportionately hired for positions requiring emotional work, that does not immediately explain a wage gap comparable to men.

==Implications==

Positive affective display in service interactions, such as [[smiling]] and conveying friendliness, are positively associated with customer positive feelings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pugh |first1=S.D. |year=2001 |title=Service with a smile: emotional contagion in the service encounter |jstor=3069445 |journal=[[Academy of Management Journal]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1018–1027 |doi=10.2307/3069445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and important outcomes, such as intention to return, intention to recommend a store to others, and perception of overall service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parasuraman |first1=A. |last2=Zeithaml |first2=V.A. |last3=Berry |first3=L.L. |date=Spring 1988 |title=SERVQUAL: a multiple-item scale for measuring customer perceptions of service quality |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00224359/70 |journal=Journal of Retailing |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=12–40 }} [http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063550/http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that emotional labor may lead to employees' [[emotional exhaustion]] and [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]] over time, and may also reduce employees' [[job satisfaction]]. That is, higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related to higher levels of employees' emotional exhaustion,&lt;ref name="grandey_2005"/&gt; and lower levels of employees' job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brotheridge |first1=C. M. |last2=Grandey |first2=A. A. |year=2002 |title=Emotional labor and burnout: Comparing two perspectives of people work |work=Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume=60|publisher=Aop.psy.unibe.ch |url=http://www.aop.psy.unibe.ch/lehre/proseminar_burnout/9_23.05.07%20Brotheridge%20Grandey%202002.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1006/jvbe.2001.1815 |pages=17–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is empirical evidence that higher levels of emotional labor demands are not uniformly rewarded with higher wages. Rather, the reward is dependent on the level of general cognitive demands required by the job. That is, occupations with high cognitive demands evidence wage returns with increasing emotional labor demands; whereas occupations low in cognitive demands evidence a wage "penalty" with increasing emotional labor demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glomb |first1=T.M. |last2=Kammeyer-Mueller |first2=J. |last3=Rotundo |first3=M. |year=2004 |title=Emotional labor demands and compensating wage differentials |work=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=89 |pages=700–714 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |pmid=15327355 }} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220022147/http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping skills===
[[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] occurs in response to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use to adjust to the changes that occur in your life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/dual-diagnosis-program/News_and_Resources/How_Do_You_Cope |title=How Do You Cope |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2015 |website=ucla.edu |publisher=UCLA |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform to the best of their ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diefendorff|first=J|last2=Gosserand|first2=R|date=2003|title=Understanding the emotional labor process: A control theory perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=24|pages=945–959|doi=10.1002/job.230|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=November 20, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental inequality in the United Kingdom''' is the way in which the quality of the environment differs between different communities in the UK.&lt;ref name="defra1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/reports/cat09/0701110944_AQinequalitiesFNL_AEAT_0506.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415121248/http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/reports/cat09/0701110944_AQinequalitiesFNL_AEAT_0506.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences are felt across a number of aspects of the environment, including air pollution, access to green space and exposure to flood risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsx.org.uk/resources/EJIDefinition_page3198.aspx |title=London Sustainability Exchange |publisher=LSX |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425162529/http://www.lsx.org.uk/resources/EJIDefinition_page3198.aspx# |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept of 'environmental inequality'==
===Definitions===
[[The Environment Agency]], a British non-departmental public body of the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA), defines 'environmental inequality' as follows: 'To observe or claim an environmental inequality is to point out that an aspect of the environment is distributed unevenly amongst different social groups (differentiated by social class, ethnicity, gender, age, location, etc.)'.&lt;ref name="staffs1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/geography/links/IESR/downloads/SC020061_SR1%20report%20-%20inequalities%20%20flood%20risk.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - PUBLISHED FLOOD.doc |website=Staffs.ac.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sustainable Development Research Network (SDRN) define environmental inequality as follows: 'Environmental inequality refers to the unequal distribution of environmental risks and hazards and access to environmental goods and services.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-research.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sdrnbriefingtwo_final_000.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425162529/http://www.sd-research.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sdrnbriefingtwo_final_000.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Walker (professor)|Gordon Walker]] (Department of Geography, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University and Malcolm Eames (University of Cardiff) define 'environmental inequality' as 'covering a wide range of questions of difference or unevenness, including:

*Who has good quality and safe environment to live in, who experiences pollution, hazards and risks and who is distanced or protected from such impacts?
*Who accesses and consumes environmental resources and who is unable to do so, or limited in their degree of access and consumption?
*Who is able to shape environmental decision-making and who is not? Who is included who is excluded?'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/downloads/ei_discussion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313100328/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/downloads/ei_discussion.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Liam Downey (2005) has distinguished five different ways of defining environmental inequality:

i) Intentional racism definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise when environmental hazards are intentionally placed in minority neighbourhoods by private companies.

ii) Disparate exposure definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when members of a specific social group are more highly exposed to some set of environmental pollutants than we would expect if group members were randomly distributed across residential space'.

iii) Disparate health impact definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when the negative health effects of residential proximity or exposure to environmental hazards are distributed unequally across social groups.'

iv) Disparate social impacts definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when members of a specific social group are more likely to live in environmentally hazardous neighborhoods than we would expect if group members were randomly distributed across residential space.'

v) Relative distribution of burdens versus benefits definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise when groups that receive greater benefits from capitalist social relations (according to proponents of this definition, this means whites and the middle and upper classes) are less burdened by industrial pollution than groups that receive fewer benefits from capitalist social relations (according to proponents of this definition, this means people of colour, the poor and the working classes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3162366 | pmid=21874079 | doi=10.1080/027321790518870 | volume=25 | title=Assessing Environmental Inequality: How the conclusions we draw vary according to the definitions we employ | year=2005 | journal=Sociol Spectr | pages=349–369 | last1 = Downey | first1 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History ===
The concept of environmental inequality emerged in the context of the movement for [[Environmental Justice]]. The Environmental Justice movement originated in the US in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/ejinthe21century.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125172813/http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/ejinthe21century.htm |archivedate=2011-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to concerns about communities from poor, black and minority ethnic environments being disproportionately affected by environmental issues and excluded from environmental decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;See Schlosberg, David. (2007) Defining Environmental Justice: Theories, Movements, and Nature. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Much initial progress on promoting an Environmental Justice agenda in the UK was made in Scotland, beginning with a speech made by [[Jack McConnell]], First Minister of the [[Scottish Executive]] in 2002. McConnell said: '... the reality is that the people who have the most urgent environmental concerns in Scotland are those who daily cope with the consequences of a poor quality of life, and live in a rotten environment – close to industrial pollution, plagued by vehicle emissions, streets filled by litter and walls covered in graffiti. This is true for Scotland and also true elsewhere in the world. These are circumstances which would not be acceptable to better off communities in our society, and those who have to endure such environments in which to bring up a family, or grow old themselves are being denied environmental justice.'&lt;ref name="scotland2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/05/23091323/12 |title=Sustainable Development: A Review of International Literature |website=Scotland.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this speech, and in light of Environmental Justice campaigning by [[Friends of the Earth]] Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe-scotland.org.uk/access-to-justice |title=Access to Environmental Justice &amp;#124; Friends of the Earth Scotland |website=Foe-scotland.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  references to Environmental Justice have been made in several Scottish policy documents ( e.g. Scottish Executive 2002c, 2003, 2003a (the Partnership Agreement); Scottish Executive Development Department, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005). The Scottish Executive, in 2005, commissioned research into ways of making environmental information more accessible to the public, and has also recently commissioned a study that investigates the social impacts of flooding.&lt;ref name="scotland2006"/&gt;

An Environmental Justice agenda has also been emerging in England since the late 1990s. In 1999, Environment Minister [[Michael Meacher]] wrote, in a foreword to 'Equality and the Environment' by Brenda Boardman: 'environmental problems are serious and impact most heavily on the most vulnerable members of society: the old, the very young and the poor.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/environmental_justice.pdf |format=PDF |title=Environmental justice : Rights and means to a healthy environment for all |website=Foe.co.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 speech, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] spoke about the need to address environmental issues such as access to green space and air quality in deprived urban areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://number10.gov.uk/page158 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20061004085342/number10.gov.uk/page158 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-04 |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives |website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a speech given to the UN in New York, 2007, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said that 'the consequences of climate change will be disproportionately felt by the poorest who are least responsible for it – making the issue of climate change one of justice as much as economic development...economic progress social justice and environmental care now go together.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6924570.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; In full: Brown's speech at UN |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of this agenda became clear at a policy level in England, in [[DEFRA]]'s 1999 Sustainable Development Strategy 'A Better Life', in which there was a focus on access to environmental information, decision making and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/uk-strategy99/index.htm |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives |website=Collections.europarchive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080530153425/http:/www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/uk-strategy99/index.htm |archivedate=2008-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Justice theme was evident again in the 2004 Sustainable Development Strategy, which commissioned a public consultation on issues around environmental justice and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/pdf/finalsummary.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Draft final.doc |website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080530153425/http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/pdf/finalsummary.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in 2003, the government's Social Exclusion Unit published a report that examined issues around inequalities in transport and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100907154242/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-09-07 |format=PDF |title=Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion |website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One governmental actor involved in pushing forward the Environmental Justice agenda was The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. In 2004, it included environmental factors in its indices of deprivation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/131209.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081211181656/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/131209.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2005, it commissioned research into the links between social and economic conditions and environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;'Improving the prospects of people living in areas of multiple deprivation in England' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Environmental Justice agenda was also taken on by the government's [[Sustainable Development Commission]] (SDC). In their November 2001 review of the UK's Sustainable Development Strategy, SDC approached issues of regeneration, poverty and the environment with an environmental justice perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/data/files/publications/011101%20Review%202001%20-%20headlining%20sustainable%20development.pdf |format=PDF |title=Review 2001: headlining sustainable development |website=Sd-commission.org.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in their 2002 report 'Vision for Sustainable Regeneration, Environment and Poverty', SDC stressed the need for a new approach to sustainable regeneration that acknowledges the importance of environmental inequalities and the links between poverty and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/data/files/publications/021001%20Vision%20for%20sustainable%20regeneration,%20environment.pdf |format=PDF |title=Vision for sustainable regeneration, environment &amp; poverty – the missing link |website=Sd-commission.org.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discourse around environmental justice in the UK is often framed in terms of 'environmental equality', following DEFRA's decision to use environmental equality as one of its sustainable development indicators.&lt;ref name="defra2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sd.defra.gov.uk/2011/09/defra-invites-feedback-on-proposals-for-new-indicators/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111108152326/http://sd.defra.gov.uk/2011/09/defra-invites-feedback-on-proposals-for-new-indicators/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sd.defra.gov.uk/progress/national/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111108125944/http://sd.defra.gov.uk/progress/national/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People affected==
The Environment Agency states that 'People who are socially and economically disadvantaged often live in the worst environments. For example, those living in the most deprived parts of England experience the worst air quality and have less access to green space and adequate housing. These problems can affect people's health and well being and can add to the burden of social and economic deprivation. They can also limit the opportunities available for people to improve their lives and undermine attempts to renew local neighbourhoods. Those affected tend to be the most vulnerable and excluded in society.'&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/position/41189.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529041353/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/position/41189.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that people from [[Black and ethnic minority|BME]] (black and minority ethnic) backgrounds suffer the worst environmental conditions, and are excluded from environmental decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Agyeman, J., 'Ethnic minorities in Britain: short change, systematic indifference and sustainable development', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; UK NGO and think-tank Capacity Global, in 'BMEs – Tackling Social and Environmental Justice', argue that several barriers exist, which hinder BAME communities' action on tackling environmental problems.&lt;ref name="capacity1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/BAMEs_tackling_social_environmental_justice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402025518/http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/BAMEs_tackling_social_environmental_justice.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Access to parks, green spaces and the natural environment===
The most affluent 20 per cent of council wards have five times the amount of parks or general green space (excluding gardens) per person than the most deprived 10 per cent of wards.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabe.org.uk/files/urban-green-nation.pdf |title=Online Casino - Play Blackjack, Roulette, Slots &amp; More &amp;#124; Casino Oasis |website=Cabe.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wards with a population with fewer than 2% black and minority ethnic residents have six times as many parks and eleven times more public green space as wards where more than 40 per cent of the population are people from black and minority ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

According to a 2011 DEFRA White Paper on the Natural Environment, people in deprived areas are nearly six times less likely than those in affluent ones to describe their area as 'green', and 'those living in deprived areas, minority ethnic communities, elderly people and those with disabilities have less access to green spaces or tend to use them less.' This paper also noted that the frequency of exposure to the natural environment (incorporating a broad array of living things including wildlife, forests, rivers, streams, lakes, seas, countryside, farmed land and urban green space) is 'significantly lower' amongst those aged above 65, BME populations and those on low incomes (members of DE socioeconomic groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8082/8082.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050649/http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8082/8082.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the government's [[Forestry Commission]], several factors interact to prevent black and minority ethnic groups from having the same access to woodland as other groups. These are: economic factors; lack of awareness, familiarity, knowledge, confidence or interest; cultural attitudes and preferences; feeling unwelcome and out of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/FR290807_RESFinalReport.pdf/$FILE/FR290807_RESFinalReport.pdf |title=Race Equality and the Forestry Commission - Final Report |website=Forestry.gov.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure to flood risk===
Deprived communities are more exposed to flood risk, with eight times more people in the most deprived 10% of the population living in tidal floodplains than the least deprived 10%. People in deciles 1 and 2 (decile 1 being the most deprived 10% of the population and decile 2 the second most deprived 10%) are 47 per cent more likely to be living at risk of flooding than the rest of the population for zone 2 floodrisk areas, and 62% more likely for zone 3.&lt;ref name="staffs1"/&gt;

===Air pollution===
The worst levels of [[air pollution]] are experienced by people in the most deprived 10% areas in England. These people are also subject to 41% higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide from transport and industry than the average.&lt;ref name="defra1"/&gt; The average black or black-British African in the UK person is exposed to 27.25 micrograms per cubic metre of harmful pollutant PM10. This is over 28% higher than the average urban white person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710192634/http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure to harmful chemicals===
A 1999 Friends of the Earth report found that 82% of all carcinogenic chemical emissions were released by factories in the most deprived 20% wards. Further, the report suggested that because 70% of all people from ethnic minorities in the UK live in the 88 most deprived wards, this exposure to harmful chemicals disproportionately affects these people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Transport-related problems===
Over a quarter  of child pedestrian casualties happen in the most deprived 10% of wards. In Wales, children and people aged over 65 are twice as likely to be injured by motor vehicles in deprived areas than in more advantaged areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files/AT/Publications/health_inequality_FINAL.pdf) ]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximity to waste and landfill sites===
An investigation by the Environment Agency into Environmental Justice in South Yorkshire revealed that in South Yorkshire, people in decile 1 are twice as likely to be living next to a recycling site, a waste transfer site or a landfill site as the rest of the population and three times more likely to be living near to an amenity site.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Justice in South Yorkshire: Locating Social Deprivation and Poor Environments using Multiple Indicators Fairburn J, Butler B and Smith G, Local Environment Vol. 14 (2) 2009 pp 139 – 154 Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK as a whole, deprived communities are more likely to live near waste sites except landfill sites, where it is the least deprived populations that are located nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/EnvJustice/downloads/SR3%20Waste.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512064536/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/EnvJustice/downloads/SR3%20Waste.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Export of products banned for sale in the UK===
[[Innospec]], a company based in [[Ellesmere Port]], is the last remaining manufacturer of [[tetraethyl lead]] in the world. The product is banned for general sale in the UK, but has been exported to countries such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Burma]], [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Monbiot |first1=George |title=Yes, lead poisoning could really be a cause of violent crime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/07/violent-crime-lead-poisoning-british-export |accessdate=10 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm has admitted paying bribes to foreign officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Evans |first1=Rob |title=Chemical firm Innospec admits bribing foreign officials |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/18/firm-bribes-banned-chemical-tetraethyl |accessdate=10 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[George Monbiot]] has argued that Innospec was let off lightly for the bribery and has termed the continued permissiveness in allowing Innospec to export its product as 'environmental racism'.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

==Causes==
As for the causes of environmental inequalities in the UK, the Environment Agency writes: 'The causes of these inequalities are often complex and long-standing. Some problems are due to the historical location of industry and communities; others are the result of the impacts of new developments such as traffic. Often these environmental problems are caused by the actions of others who do not live in the affected community. Often those most affected have not been involved in the decisions that affect the quality of their environment.'&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; Environmental equity advocates often argue that environmental inequalities are entrenched due to the fact that the vulnerable communities exposed to environmental burdens lack the means necessary to change their situation due to factors such as limited economic means, exclusion from decision-making processes and [[institutionalised racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbecal.org/pdf/healthy-communities.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040211/http://www.cbecal.org/pdf/healthy-communities.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work being done==
The UK government has included environmental equality as one of its [[sustainable development]] indicators since the establishment of these indicators in 1992.&lt;ref name="defra2"/&gt;  Further, [[DEFRA]] have incorporated an environmental inequalities analysis into its work,&lt;ref name="defra1"/&gt; and the Environment Agency have published several reports on environmental inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRW-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0905BJOK-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRU-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRV-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wales, action around environmental inequalities has primarily been coordinated through the [[Welsh Assembly]]'s Community First initiative, which has attempted to enable deprived communities to take action themselves on sustainable development issues, with a particular focus on health inequalities and the health benefits of access to environmental goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcva.org.uk/all/dsp_text.cfm?0%3D0%26display_sitetextid%3D1504 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208213351/http://www.wcva.org.uk/all/dsp_text.cfm?0=0&amp;display_sitetextid=1504 |archivedate=2011-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh Assembly have recognised the environmental aspects of deprivation, incorporating this into its 2008 index of multiple deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2010/100712wimd08summaryen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.proni.gov.uk/20110830024651/http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2010/100712wimd08summaryen.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several UK academics have published widely around environmental inequalities. Academics working on environmental inequalities include Gordon Walker of Lancaster University and Professor Malcolm Eames of Cardiff University.&lt;ref&gt;See a paper co-written by Walker and Eames called 'Environmental inequalities : reflections on a transdisciplinary seminar series.' Local Environment, 13 (8). pp. 663-667&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Brunel University and Lancaster University organised a series of seminars on environmental inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002232803/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/ |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by the Economic &amp; Social Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Sustainable Development Research Council, the Environment Agency and DEFRA.

The following UK NGOs work on issues around environmental inequalities:
* [[Friends of the Earth]] do some work on issues around environmental justice and inequalities. In 2001, they published a briefing on Environmental Justice with the [[ESRC]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and they have also published a report on social exclusion and transport in Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/env_justice_bradford.pdf |format=PDF |title=Environmental Justice : Mapping transport and social exclusion in Bradford |website=Foe.co.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32038">'''Escalation of commitment''' is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some [[Decision-making|decision]], action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=C7KbGmTg3qUC|page=191}} |chapter=The escalation of commitment: An update and appraisal|editor1-last=Shapira|editor1-first=Zur|title=Organizational Decision Making|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=191–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists and [[behavioral scientists]] use a related term, ''sunk-cost fallacy'', to describe the justification of increased [[investment]] of money, time, lives, etc. in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment ("[[sunk cost]]") despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, beginning immediately, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

In [[sociology]], ''irrational escalation of commitment'' or ''commitment bias'' describe similar behaviours. The phenomenon and the sentiment underlying it are reflected in such proverbial images as "throwing good money after bad", "in for a penny, in for a pound", and "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again".

== Early use ==
Escalation of commitment was first described by Barry M. Staw in his 1976 paper, "Knee deep in the big muddy: A study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action".&lt;ref name=Staw1976&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|title=Knee-deep in the big muddy: a study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1976|volume=16|issue=1|pages=27–44|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(76)90005-2|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.3668&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers, inspired by the work of Staw, conducted studies that tested factors, situations and causes of escalation of commitment. The research introduced other analyses of situations and how people approach problems and make decisions. Some of the earliest work stemmed from events in which this phenomenon had an effect and help explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Researchers define escalation of commitment ===

Over the past few decades, researchers have followed and analyzed many examples of the escalation of commitment to a situation. The heightened situations are explained in three elements. Firstly, a situation has a costly amount of resources such as time, money and people invested in the project. Next, past behavior leads up to an apex in time where the project has not met expectations or could be in a cautious state of decline. Lastly, these problems all force a decision-maker to make choices that include the options of continuing to pursue a project until completion by adding additional costs, or canceling the project altogether.&lt;ref name="Moon2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Henry|title=The two faces of conscientiousness: Duty and achievement striving in escalation of commitment dilemmas|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=86|issue=3|pages=533–540|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also developed an argument regarding how  escalation of commitment is observed in two different categories.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brockner|first1=Joel|title=The escalation of commitment to a failing course of action: toward theoretical progress|journal=Academy of Management Review|date=1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.5465/AMR.1992.4279568|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311233821/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers believe that the need to escalate resources is linked to [[expectancy theory]]. "According to such a viewpoint, decision makers assess the probability that additional resource allocations will lead to goal attainment, as well as the value of goal attainment (i.e., rewards minus costs), and thereby generate a subjective expected utility associated with the decision to allocate additional resources."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The next phase of the escalation process is self-justification and rationalizing if the decision the leader made used resources well, if the resources being used were used to make positive change, and assuring themselves that the decision they chose was right. Leaders must balance costs and benefits of any problem to produce a final decision. What matters most often in assuring the leader that they made the right choice regardless of the final outcome is if their decision is what others believed in.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Research conducted on the topic has been taken from many other forms and theories of psychology. Many believe that what researchers have done thus far to explain this behavior is best analyzed  and tested through situational development and resource allocation.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Other research has identified circumstances that lead to the opposite of escalation of commitment, namely deescalation of commitment. This research explains the factors that influence whether escalation or deescalation of commitment is more likely to occur through the role of budgeting and mental accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Chip. "Escalation and de-escalation of commitment in response to sunk costs: The role of budgeting in mental accounting." ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'' 62 (1995): 38-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam War ===

Escalation of commitment can many times cause behavior change by means of locking into resources. One of the first examples of escalation of commitment was described by [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]], who wrote to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to explain to him the predictions of the war outcome:&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

{{quote|The decision you face now is crucial. Once large numbers of U.S. troops are committed to direct combat, they will begin to take heavy casualties in a war they are ill equipped to fight in a noncooperative if not downright hostile countryside. Once we suffer large casualties, we will have started a well-nigh irreversible process. Our involvement will be so great that we cannot—without national humiliation—stop short of achieving our complete objectives. Of the two possibilities, I think humiliation would be more likely than the achievement of our objectives—even after we have paid terrible costs.&lt;ref name="Gettleman1995"&gt;Ball, George (July 1, 1965). "Memo from George Ball to President Johnson. A Compromise Solution in South Vietnam". In {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVtNalqmYgAC&amp;pg=PA283|last=Gettleman|first=Marvin E.|title=Vietnam and America: A Documented History|year=1995|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0-8021-3362-5|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Theories ==
=== Self-justification theory ===

[[Self-justification theory|Self-justification]] thought process is a part of commitment decisions of leaders and managers of a group and can therefore cause a rise in commitment levels.&lt;ref name="Huning2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of Performance Attributions on Escalation of Commitment|last = Huning|first = Tobias M|date = 2014|volume = 18|issue = 1|journal = Journal of Organizational Culture, Communications and Conflict|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Thomson|first2 = Neal F|url = http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623232138/http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf#page=157|archivedate = 2016-06-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude provides "one explanation for why people escalate commitment to their past investments."&lt;ref name="Kelly2013"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Escalation of Commitment|last = Kelly|first = Theresa F|publisher = Sage Publications, Inc|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, CA|pages =256–259 |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Management Theory|last2 = Milkman|first2 = Katherine L|editor1-last=Kessler|editor1-first= Eric H|doi=10.4135/9781452276090.n78|ISBN= 9781412997829|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4wtzAwAAQBAJ|page=256}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers make decisions that reflect previous behavior. Managers tend to recall and follow information that is aligned to their behavior to create consistency for their current and future decisions. If a group member or outside party recognizes inconsistent decision making, this can alter the leadership role of the manager. Managers have external influence from society, peers, and authority, which can significantly alter a manager's perception on what factors realistically matter when making decisions.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Prospect theory ===

[[Prospect theory]] helps to describe the natural reactions and processes involved in making a decision in a risk-taking situation. Prospect theory makes the argument for how levels of wealth, whether that is people, money, or time, affect how a decision is made. Researchers were particularly interested in how one perceives a situation based on costs and benefits.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The framing to how the problem is introduced is crucial for understanding and thinking of the probability that the situation will either work in favor or against you and how to prepare for those changes. "Whyte (1986) argued that prospect theory provides the psychological mechanism by which to explain escalating commitment to a failing course of action without the need to invoke self-justification processes. (Fiegenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1988: 99)"&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Prospect theorists believe that one's use of this process is when there is a negative downfall in the stakes that will affect the outcome of the project. To ensure they will not fail, the individual may add more resources to assure them that they will succeed. Although this theory seems realistic, researchers "Davis and Bobko (1986) found no effect of personal responsibility on continued commitment to the previous course of action in the positive frame condition."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Which means that escalation of commitment will be lower in the higher responsibility situation.

=== Attribution theory ===

The [[attribution theory]], originating from [[Fritz Heider]], "attempts to find causal explanations for events and human behaviors." This theory approaches two methods of inquiry including locus of causality and stability.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Locus of causality reflects on internal characteristics of an individual, such as intelligence levels and attention seeking, with the relationship of the external space such as weather forecasts and task difficulty.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Aspects of control become a significant factor in how a manager justifies a decision made. Managers will use the relationship between internal and external factors to describe why they made a decision to a single point of view. Managers may justify their actions by explaining that this was out of their personal control of the event, or they could believe that the decision could not be controlled by anyone else. Research suggests that "the type of attribution made by an employee across these dimensions is likely to impact an employee's tendency to engage in the negative emotional activity referred to as escalation of commitment."&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Social identity theory ===

Identity is a large part of how we move through the world. Private thoughts and opinions as well as the effect of others create the [[social identity theory]]. People make connections between their use of groups and their own view of themselves, which researchers have discovered motivates people to keep their social status and to defend it whenever it is endangered.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The escalation of commitment in political decision-making groups: a social identity approach|last = Dietz-Uhler|first = Beth|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1996|volume=26|issue=4|pages=611–629|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199607)26:4&lt;611::AID-EJSP781&gt;3.0.CO;2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical models ===

==== Temporal model of escalation ====
Groups engage in temporal comparisons, which means that you compare actions and behaviors at "different points in time."&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt; This is a form of social identity scenario. This type of comparison can be made when a decision seems unproductive and forces team members to consider any threat to the group.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt;

==== Aggregate model ====
"The aggregate model's emphasis is upon the accumulation and balance of forces rather than the ordering of effects over time."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; The model is general and can provide an ideal view as to how. The effects whether positive or negative are defined by micro and macro forces. This model goes by situation rather than what researchers have defined as the norm. There is no process to follow, which makes it very useful for researchers because they can understand a situation more clearly as well as see the bigger picture of the situation.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Determinants ==
The main drivers of the tendency to continue investing in losing propositions are project, psychological, social, and structural.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleesman|first1=Dustin J.|last2=Conlon|first2=Donald E.|last3=McNamara|first3=Gerry|last4=Miles|first4=Jonathan E.|title=Cleaning Up the Big Muddy: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Determinants of Escalation of Commitment|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=2012|volume=55|issue=3|pages=541–562|doi=10.5465/amj.2010.0696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project ===

Project determinants are those that refer to the original commitments and decisions made at a project's beginning. This includes general project characteristics and initial financial costs.&lt;ref name="Liang2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=Beichen|last2=Kale|first2=Sudhir H.|last3=Cherian|first3=Joseph|title=Is the future static or dynamic? The role of culture on escalation of commitment in new product development|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=155–163|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, decision risk, opportunity cost information, and information acquisition have been found to have negative relationships with escalation of commitment. Decision uncertainty, positive performance trend information, and expressed preference for initial decision have been found to have positive relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

High costs of ending a project or changing its course, potential financial gain upon completion, and extensive structure can factor in to escalation of commitment, making it difficult to walk away from the project. Preventing future monetary loss, potential savings, and having clearly available alternatives can allow for avoidance of the behavior. In studies by Teger and later Ross and Staw, situations where ending an action costs more than completing it resulted in decision makers being trapped in their current, costly behaviors.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt;

=== Psychological ===

Psychological determinants are those that refer to internal views on the actions and information involved in a project. This can include cognitive factors, personality, and emotions as they relate to project elements.&lt;ref name="Liang2014" /&gt; Of these, sunk costs, time investment, decision maker experience and expertise, self-efficacy and confidence, personal responsibility for the initial decision, ego threat, and proximity to project completion have been found to have positive relationships with escalation of commitment, while anticipated regret and positive information framing have been found to have negative relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

Optimism and belief that one has control over what will still be positive outcomes lead to continued self-justification of commitment to actions. People add to their initial personal investments in the hope they will overcome currently negative results. This was illustrated in a case study by Staw, where providing business students with manipulated responsibilities for initial decisions and their outcomes resulted in the greatest commitment to increased actions and resources when the initial decision assigned was made directly by the student with poor outcomes.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt; In these instances, people take further risk in an attempt to avoid further problems. This is even more likely when subjects view current issues as having unstable reasoning rather than stable reasoning, or when the individual is unwilling to admit mistakes.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; They then believe the situation will stabilize or turn around. [[Confirmation bias]] can also lead to escalation of commitment as individuals are then less likely to recognize the negative results of their decisions.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; On the other hand, if the results are recognized, they can be blamed on unforeseeable events occurring during the course of the project.

The effect of sunk costs is often seen escalating commitment. When the amount of investment is greater and can not be recovered, the desire to avoid complete loss of those resources and keeping with impression management prompts continued investment over pulling out.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; Relatedly, as invested resources can include time, closeness to completion of a project yields similar results. More value is placed on project when they are early or late in their process due to the clarity of completion goals at those points.&lt;ref name=Horn2012&gt;{{cite thesis|first1=Marianna|last1=Horn|title=The downside of persistence: The effects of mood on an escalation of commitment paradigm|date=2012|url=https://etd.auburn.edu/handle/10415/3290?show=full|HDL=10415/3290}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's more likely that risks will be taken at these points than in a project closer to a visible midpoint.

=== Social ===

Social determinants are those that refer to the expectations and influence of other individuals or groups on project actions. Included in these, group identity or cohesive strength has been found to have the most influence on escalation of commitment while public evaluation of decision and resistance to decision from others has little significance in relation.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

==== External justification and binding ====
Individuals present themselves cautiously to others in the environment. They don't concentrate on themselves and what they believe is accurate and competent—they are only interested in their organization appearing competent. Escalation of commitment is about decision making that usually comes in a form of a group or individual deciding a course of action. Managers have a responsibility to choose the fate of what a group of people have been working on. A manager who decides to back a team out of a project isn't concerned that the project failed, they are concerned that team members may think the manager is incompetent. Studies that tested this phenomenon included factors such as policy resistance, job insecurity (Fox &amp; Staw 1979), and audience size (Rubin &amp; Lang 1981). All showed a spike in commitment when these realistic factors are present. This mental and emotional response is referred to as the face-saving effect. Individuals who are responsible for others are constantly checking themselves to assure that their actions and beliefs are parallel to the expectations for their viewers. One's social identity to the public can decide your fate. For example, a team can identify a level of commitment and personal connection to an idea or project. Team members consistently use statements like "that project is Bob's baby," or "oh, we had the same idea." Both ends of the spectrum are crucial to how others view and analyze a situation, especially something that failed.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

==== Leadership norms ====
Leaders are responsible for guiding a team through the difficult problems into a solution. Although many times, the negative aspects of commitments can discussed in more detail and importance, there are many social rewards that are positive. One example of this phenomenon is persistence. A project on the verge of failure is a manager's responsibility to revive, but with persistence, a manager can get rewarded to turning a bad project into something great. Rewards are earned for turning around a team to produce something successful. When managers stick to their goals, and get their team to produce responsibly.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Structural ===

Structural determinants are those that refer to the cultural and environmental features and resources of the project's overall organization. The minimal research available on them indicates that agency problems most influence escalation of commitment.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

There are macro-level variables that affect the organizational structure of a team and how the make decisions. Decisions are made based on individuals in a group setting with specific roles and responsibilities and effect decisions that are a product of interaction in the team. The determinant that affects escalation of commitment is institutional inertia. This phenomenon is used to describe how individual attitudes and behavior changes frequently, so therefore, a group's stature is also unpredictable and controllable. "Organizations have very imperfect sensory systems, making them relatively impervious to changes in their environments."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This is one factor that plays a role in how issues are addressed. When there are a group of individuals involved in communication, decisions, and change, with the lack of consistency in the group, most of the tasks fail to complete. This phenomenon occurs in situations such as policy change, rulings and procedures.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This issue can also cause havoc for an organization when they are too attached to a policy, thought process or identity because they are not free to change. "On occasion, a project, product, or policy can become so closely tied to the values and purposes of the organization that it becomes almost unthinkable to consider withdrawal."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; One primary example of this phenomenon is the downfall of the [[Pan American World Airways]] company, commonly known as Pan Am. Pan Am was a well known airlines and hotel with hundreds of employees. With the turn of industry, airline policies were deregulated and caused financial downfall for Pan Am. The company over time made cuts to their company to stay afloat. The company believed that their image of being an airline was more important than being a successful company that they removed all of the assets that were in fact making them the largest amount of revenue only to save the image they thought they needed to remain to be Pan Am.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Groups vs individuals ==
In groups, it can be more difficult to attribute issues to a single, simpler determinant. While determinants are still applicable, oftentimes there are more complex factors when organizational goals and actions misalign. Groups, especially as they grow larger, can be resistant to changing course.

Even if the need to change course or cease action is recognized, communication speed, policies, and business politics can be hindrances.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; A larger organization, especially one with a spread of subgroups, has to communicate the argument and decision to go against previous actions across the appropriate levels. If this communication does not occur in a timely manner or is blocked, the final decision may not be made and acted upon. A decision that goes against existing rules and processes may also reach resistance even with support from those within the organization. Individuals and groups that are directly employed due to a project, have financial stake in it may provide enough opposition to prevent changes from being made as well. They feel personally responsible for the parts they've worked on and can also feel that they too are being replaced or terminated.&lt;ref name="Stray2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stray|first1=Viktoria Gulliksen|last2=Moe|first2=Nils Brede|last3=Dybå|first3=Tore|chapter=Escalation of Commitment: A Longitudinal Case Study of Daily Meetings|date=2012|volume=111|pages=153–167|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-30350-0_11|title=Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming|ISBN=978-3-642-30349-4|series= Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escalation of commitment can then occur in any of these situations. External groups can play an even larger part in escalating commitment if their power is greater than that of the group taking action and they use that power to directly lead and influence.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

With a larger number of decision makers included, groups have the opportunity for greater productivity than single individuals, but they also have the opportunity for greater losses and escalation.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=Max H.|last2=Giuliano|first2=Toni|last3=Appelman|first3=Alan|title=Escalation of commitment in individual and group decision making|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1984|volume=33|issue=2|pages=141–152|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(84)90017-5|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318080454/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members can eliminate some of the escalation potential if they come to a better decision earlier on in the process and avoid the need to change course dramatically. Yet they can also hold onto a larger base of support for their initial actions to the point where escalation potential is increased. In this case, [[groupthink]] assists in keeping with the original decision and pressures towards conformity rather than dividing the group with other options. Also, a group whose members are not cohesive can have decreased escalation potential due to conflicts and varying levels of inclusion in the process.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984" /&gt;

Organizations that are family businesses are especially prone to escalation of commitment due to the added level of going through the family structure in addition to the business structure, allowing for further conflicts between the two.&lt;ref name="Woods2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=Jeremy A.|last2=Dalziel|first2=Thomas|last3=Barton|first3=Sidney L.|title=Escalation of commitment in private family businesses: The influence of outside board members|journal=Journal of Family Business Strategy|date=2012|volume=3|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1016/j.jfbs.2012.01.002|url=http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504212721/http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business reputation, customer and share loss, and financial loss become risks.

The '''Esperanto movement''', less commonly referred to as '''Esperantism''' ({{lang-eo|Esperantismo}}), is a [[Social movement|movement]] to disseminate the use of the [[Constructed language|planned]] [[International auxiliary language|international language]] [[Esperanto]].&lt;ref&gt;See the definition in the "[https://eo.wikisource.org/wiki/Bulonja_deklaracio Deklaracio pri la Esenco de la Esperantismo]" ("Bulonja Deklaracio", 1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The movement does not aim to supplant national languages but merely to supplement them.&lt;ref name="Janton1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Janton|title=Esperanto: Language, Literature, and Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTZhbJq8pJ0C&amp;pg=PA33|year=1993|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1253-4|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is sometimes used even for all people speaking Esperanto including their [[Esperanto culture|culture]], which is not a correct use of the sociological term ''movement''.

== Politics ==
Esperanto has been placed in a few proposed political situations. The most popular of these is the former minor party  ''Europe—Democracy—Esperanto'', which aims to establish Esperanto as the [[official language]] of the [[European Union]]. Grin's Report, published in 2005 by [[François Grin]] found that the use of [[English language]] as the lingua franca within the European Union costs billions annually and significantly benefits [[English-speaking countries]] financially. The report considered a scenario where Esperanto would be the lingua franca and found that it would have many advantages, particularly economically speaking, as well as [[ideologically]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3060">'''Francis John McConnell''' (August 18, 1871 &amp;ndash; August 18, 1953) was an [[United States|American]] social reformer and a [[bishop]] in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], elected in 1912.

Born on August 18, 1871, in [[Trinway, Ohio]], he died on August 18, 1953, in [[Lucasville, Ohio]].

McConnell was a graduate of the [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] and the [[Boston University School of Theology]].  He was an ordained minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church for many years, serving among other places a large church in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

Before election to the [[episcopacy]], McConnell served as the president of [[DePauw University]], [[Greencastle, Indiana]], 1909-1912.  During his presidency he led the university's first major fund drive, the Campaign for the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Fund, which produced a total subscription of $550,546.

Francis John McConnell was a major second-generation advocate of [[Boston personalism]] who sought to apply the philosophy to social problems of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burrow Jr. |first=Rufus  |title=Francis John McConnell and personalistic social ethics |work=Methodist History |volume=31 |number=2 |year=1993 |hdl=10516/5872 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10516/5872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McConnell is best known for his quote "We need a type of patriotism that recognizes the virtues of those who are opposed to us".

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The '''grotesque body''' is a concept, or [[literary trope]], put forward by Russian [[literary critic]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his study of [[François Rabelais]]' work. The essential principle of grotesque realism is degradation, the lowering of all that is abstract, spiritual, noble, and ideal to the material level. Through the use of the grotesque body in his novels, Rabelais related political conflicts to human [[anatomy]]. In this way, Rabelais used the concept as "a figure of unruly biological and social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perforations: Grotesque Corpus |url=http://www.pd.org/topos/perforations/perf3/grotesque_corpus.html |accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by means of this information that Bakhtin pinpoints two important [[subtext]]s: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]), and the second is ''grotesque realism'' (grotesque body). Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Katerina and Michael Holquist 297-299, ''Mikhail Bakhtin''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carnival ==
[[File:GreatSouthCarnivalMaskers.jpg|thumb|321x321px|Grotesque masks are shown here, worn by many at a carnival.]]
The [[Carnival]] is known as the feast of fools. In today's world, this is better known as [[Mardi Gras]]. Mardi Gras is a religious celebration where people consume copious amounts of food and wine and have a large party to celebrate. The grotesqueness in the carnival is seen as the abundance and large amount of food consumed by the body. There is much emphasis put on the mouth  (where the body can be entered). Eating, drinking, burping from excess, etc. is all done through the mouth. Rabelais uses the Carnival to refer to politics and critique the world based on human anatomy.

In the Italian celebration of Carnival, masks play a major role as many people wear them during the celebration. Many of these masks can be seen as an exaggeration of the grotesque as they feature enlarged facial elements such as an enlarged nose (which is a part of the grotesque body). The Italian celebration of carnival is similar to that of Mardi Gras where food and alcohol are consumed in excess.

Both renditions of Carnival are celebrated immediately before the Christian season of [[Lent]] which is about a 40-day season for people of Christian (primarily Catholic) faith to cleanse themselves and become pure before [[Easter]] Sunday.

== Grotesque realism ==

Exaggeration, hyperbole, and expressiveness are all key elements of the grotesque style. Certain aspects of the body are referenced when talking about the grotesque. These things include elements of the body that either protrude from the body or a part of the body that can be entered. This is because the body in many cases is seen as pure where as the outside world is not. Therefore, parts of the body that allow the outside world in or allow elements inside the body out, are seen and used as an exaggeration of the grotesque. In the article, "Absurdity and Hidden Truth: Cunning Intelligence and Grotesque Body Images as Manifestations of the Trickster", Koepping refers back to Bakhtin's statement, "The themes of cursing and of laughter are almost exclusively a subject of the grotesqueness of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor = 1062254|title = History of Religions, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Feb., 1985), pp. 191-214|date = Feb 1985|publisher = University of Chicago Press|last = Koepping|first = Klaus-Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Small grotesque scoffing.JPG|thumb|255x255px|The grotesque is used here through the use of the mouth in the architecture of a building.]]
Italian satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] explained: "[[satire]] exhibits the grotesque body, which is dominated by the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|primary needs]] (eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, sex) to celebrate the victory of life: the social and the [[Corporeality|corporeal]] are joyfully joint in something indivisible, universal and beneficial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Se Dio avesse voluto che credessimo in lui, sarebbe esistito (in Italian) |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/276|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin explained how the grotesque body is a celebration of the cycle of life: the grotesque body is a comic figure of profound ambivalence: its positive meaning is linked to birth and renewal and its negative meaning is linked to death and decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazen Brides Grotesque Daughters Treacherous Mothers by Felicity Collins (Bakhtin, 308-317) |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/women_funny_oz/ |accessdate=2008-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042917/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/23/women_funny_oz.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rabelais' epoch (1500–1800) "it was appropriate to ridicule the [[king]] and [[clergy]], to use dung and [[urine]] to [[wikt:degradation|degrade]]; this was not to just [[Insult|mock]], it was to unleash what Bakhtin saw as the people’s power, to renew and regenerate the entire [[social system]]. It was the power of the people’s festive-carnival, a way to turn the official spectacle inside-out and upside down, just for a while; long enough to make an impression on the participating official stratum. With the advent of modernity (science, technology, [[industrial revolution]]), the mechanistic overtook the organic, and the officialdom no longer came to join in festive-carnival. The bodily lower stratum of humor dualized from the upper stratum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boje | first = David M. |date=March 2004 | title = Grotesque Method | journal = Proceedings of First International Co-sponsored Conference, Research methods Division, Academy of Management: Crossing Frontiers in Quantitative and Qualitative Research methods. | volume = 2 | pages = 1085–1114 | url = http://peaceaware.com/McD/papers/Lyon%20proceedings%20Boje%202994%20Grotesque%20Method%20.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early uses of grotesque ==
Before people began to develop literature or art, leaders would sit in their halls surrounded by their warriors amusing themselves by mocking their opponents and enemies. The warriors would laugh at any weakness or defect, either physical or mental, giving nicknames which exaggerated these traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art|last = Wright|first = Thomas|publisher = Virtue Brothers &amp; CO.|year = 1865|isbn = |location = London|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon warriors sought to give a more permanent form to their ridicule, which led to rude depictions on bare rocks, or any other surface that was convenient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Medieval Grotesque Carnival, emphasis is put on the nether regions of the body as the center and creation of meaning. The spirit rather than coming from above comes from the belly, buttocks, and genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Lübker, Henrik. "The Method of In-between in the Grotesque and the Works of Leif Lage." Continent.

'''Henry Richard Fox Bourne''' (24 December 1837 – 2 February 1909) was a British [[social reformer]] and writer.

==Early life==
Henry Fox Bourne was born at Grecian Regale, [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]], [[Jamaica]], on 24 December 1837, one of eight children of Stephen Bourne, magistrate and advocate of the abolition of slavery, and of Elizabeth Quirk. His father had founded in December 1826 the ''World,'' the first nonconformist and exclusively religious journal in England. His parents left Jamaica in 1841 for [[British Guiana]], and moved to London in 1848. There, after attending a private school, Fox Bourne entered [[University College London|London University]] in 1856, and joined classes at King's College and the City of London College. He also attended, at University College, lectures on English literature and history by [[Henry Morley]], whose intimate friend and assistant he afterwards became. In 1855 he entered the war office as a clerk, devoting his leisure to literary and journalistic work. He regularly contributed to ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'' an organ of advanced radical thought, of which Henry Morley was editor, and wrote for [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Household Words]]''.

==Writer==
In 1862 Fox Bourne made some reputation by his first independently published work, ''A Memoir of Sir Philip Sidney'', which showed painstaking research and critical insight, and remains a standard biography. There followed ''English Merchants'' (1866); ''Famous London Merchants'' (1869), written for younger readers; ''The Romance of Trade'' (1871); ''English Seamen under the Tudors'' (1868), and ''The Story of Our Colonies'' (1869). In these books Fox Bourne traced in a popular style the rise of England's commerce and colonial expansion. In 1870 Fox Bourne retired from the war office, and with the money granted him in lieu of a pension purchased the copyright and control of ''The Examiner''. Although [[John Stuart Mill]], Herbert Spencer, and Frederic Harrison were still among the contributors, the paper proved in Bourne's hands a financial failure, and he disposed of it in 1873 (see F. Harrison's Reminiscences, 1911).

The next two years he mainly spent on a ''Life of John Locke,'' which he published in 1876. From 1876 to 1887 he was editor of the ''[[Sunday Dispatch|Weekly Dispatch]]'' which under his auspices well maintained its radical independence. Fox Bourne freely criticised the [[Second Gladstone ministry|Gladstonian administration of 1880-5]], and his hostility to Gladstone's [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|home rule bill of 1886]] led to his retirement from the editorship.

==Aborigines Protection Society==
Fox Bourne became secretary of the [[Aborigines Protection Society]] (APS) on 4 January 1889. He edited its journal, the ''Aborigines' Friend,'' and pressed on public attention the need of protecting native races, especially in Africa. One of the first to denounce publicly the cruel treatment of natives in the [[Congo Free State]] in 1890, he used all efforts to secure the enforcement of the provisions of the [[Brussels Convention of 1890]] for the protection of the natives in Central Africa. He forcibly stated his views in ''The Other Side of the Emin Pasha Expedition'' (1891) and in ''Civilisation in Congo Land'' (1903). To his advocacy was largely due the ultimate improvement in native conditions in the [[Belgian Congo]].

At first, the APS, like the Anti-Slavery Society with which it merged in 1909, supported the work of British chartered companies, and believed that nurturing legitimate and more profitable trade would eliminate slave trafficking.{{sfn|Coombes|1997|pp=32–33}} By 1894, the APS retracted its support, protesting against the violence in [[Mashonaland]] in 1893 that resulted from the war which the [[British South Africa Company]] had entered into with the [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] under [[Lobengula]].{{sfn|Bressey|2013|p=153}} The APS, in contrast with the Anti-Slavery Society, disapproved of the policy of allowing chartered companies to govern colonies, sensing a conflict of interest between maintaining justice and extracting maximum profit.{{sfn|Coombes|1997|p=33}} In 1900, Fox Bourne expressed in a policy statement entitled ''The Claims of Uncivilised Races'' that the native had three fundamental rights: to his land, to his rites and institutions, and to an equal share of profits arising from colonisation. These rights should not be taken without his understanding and approval. Colonisation should be for the 'moral advantage' of the colonised more than for the 'material advantage' of the colonising power.{{sfn|Porter|2007|pp=51–52}}{{sfn|Coombes|1997|p=33}} 

Although he failed in his attempts to secure the franchise for natives in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and [[Orange River Colony|Orange River]] colonies in 1906, his strong protests against the slave traffic in [[Angola]] and the cocoa-growing islands of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] compelled the Portuguese government to admit the necessity of reform. In a series of six pamphlets (1906–8) on Egyptian affairs he denounced alleged abuses of the English military occupation, and advocated Egyptian self-government. Fox Bourne's pertinacious patience in investigation and his clearness of exposition gave his views on native questions wide influence.

==Death==
Fox Bourne died suddenly at [[Torquay]], from [[bronchitis]] contracted on his holiday, on 2 February 1909, and was cremated at Woking. A memorial service was held at Araromi chapel, Lagos. He married on 1 May 1862 Emma Deane, daughter of Henry Bleckly, a Warrington ironmaster. His widow, with two sons and a daughter, survived him.

Besides the works mentioned, Fox Bourne published: 1. (with the [[Thomas Cochrane, 11th Earl of Dundonald|Earl of Dundonald]]) ''Life of Thomas, Lord Cochrane,'' 1869. 2. ''Foreign Rivalries in Industrial Products,'' 1877. 3. ''English Newspapers,'' 2 vols. 1887, a serviceable chronicle of journalistic history. 4. ''The Aborigines Protection Society; Chapters in its History,'' 1899.

'''High Energy Biscuits''' (HEB) are [[wheat]] [[biscuit]]s containing high-[[protein]] [[cereal]]s and [[vegetable fat]]. Because of their high energy-to-weight ratio they are procured by the [[World Food Programme]], the [[food aid]] branch of the [[United Nations]], for feeding disaster victims worldwide.&lt;ref name="Em5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.em5aid.com/heb.php |title=Em5 Aid-High Energy Biscuits |publisher=Em5aid.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215065840/http://em5aid.com/heb.php |archive-date=2015-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HEBs have been provided to a variety of geographical locations. For example, HEBs were delivered to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] after the [[2008 South Ossetia war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2907 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823203656/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2907 |archivedate=2008-08-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; HEBs were also airlifted to [[Kenya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2294 |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813184431/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2294 |archivedate=August 13, 2008|title=High energy biscuits airlifted to Kenya to feed 200,000 flood victims }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently distributed in aid in the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-telegram.com/190/story/1894280.html] {{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 80 tonnes of high energy biscuits were delivered to the Tunisian border in response to the Libyan crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=567469]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301103759/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=567469 |date=March 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HEBs are usually packaged in cardboard boxes weighing 10&amp;nbsp;kg each.&lt;ref name="comp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wfpen.ernsystems.com/publicfiles/HighEnergyBiscuits.pdf |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327005543/https://wfpen.ernsystems.com/publicfiles/HighEnergyBiscuits.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |title=High Energy Biscuits }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Per 100&amp;nbsp;g, HEBs have a minimum of 450&amp;nbsp;kcal of energy, 4.5% maximum moisture, a minimum of 10-15&amp;nbsp;g of protein, a minimum of 15&amp;nbsp;g fat, and 10-15&amp;nbsp;g sugar at a maximum.&lt;ref name="comp"/&gt;

{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
'''Hootenanny''' is an [[Appalachia]]n colloquialism that was used in early twentieth century [[United States|America]] as a [[placeholder name]] to refer to things whose names were forgotten or unknown. In this usage it was synonymous with ''[[thingamajig]]'' or ''[[Placeholder name|whatchamacallit]]'', as in: "Hand me that hootenanny." ''Hootenanny'' was also an old country word for "party". Nowadays the word most commonly refers to a [[folk music]] party with an [[open mic]], at which different performers are welcome to get up and play in front of an audience.

''Hootenanny'' was also used by the leadership of early firefighting battalions to describe a "meeting of the minds" of higher ups or various department heads. The term has trickled down to working companies and is now used, with some frequency, at working incidents and other circumstances that require a focused discussion between key individuals. Most recently it was adopted for use during the annual Fire Department Instructors Conference.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Logistics professionals for the conference employ the word to call together the required personnel needed to accomplish the prodigious assignments placed on them.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Origin of modern folk music usage==
{{See also|Almanac Singers}}
According to [[Pete Seeger]], in various interviews, he first heard the word ''hootenanny'' in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] in the late 1930s. It was used by [[Hugh DeLacy|Hugh DeLacy’s]] [[New Deal]] political club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.lib.washington.edu/specialcoll/findaids/docs/papersrecords/DeLacyHugh3915.xml |title= Hugh DeLacy papers| publisher= Special Collections, Libraries of University of Washington| website= Washington.edu| access-date= January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe their monthly music fund raisers.&lt;ref name="pnwfolklore1"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://pnwfolklore.org/Hootenannies.html |title= Hootenannies in Seattle| first= Stewart |last= Hendrickson| website= PNWFolklore.org| access-date= December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some debate the club voted in ''hootenanny'', which narrowly beat out ''wingding''. Seeger, [[Woody Guthrie]] and other members of the [[Almanac Singers]] later used the word in New York City to describe their weekly [[rent party|rent parties]], which featured many notable folksingers of the time.&lt;ref name="pnwfolklore1"/&gt; In a 1962 interview in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[Joan Baez]] made the analogy that a hootenanny is to folk singing what a [[jam session]] is to jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001926/bio | title= Joan Baez: Biography | website= IMDB.com| publisher= Internet Movie Database| access-date= December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
During the early 1960s at the height of the [[American folk music revival]], the club [[Gerdes Folk City]] at 11 West 4th Street in [[Greenwich Village]] started the folk music hootenanny tradition every Monday night, that featured an open mic and welcomed performers known and unknown, young and old.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title= Bringing It All Back Home| first= Robbie |last= Woliver| publisher= Pantheon/Random House| isbn= 9780394740683| year= 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hootenanny is an annual one-day [[rockabilly]] music festival held at the Oak Canyon Ranch in Irvine, California, which also incorporates a vintage car show.

For years there have been online hootenannys. The most long-standing example is [[Small Talk At The Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= http://www.mtp.hum.ku.dk/details.asp?ELN=500106|title=Petersen, Nils Holger, Music Practices around Bob Dylan, Medieval Rituals, and Modernity| isbn= 978-87-635-0423-2| publisher= Københavns| year= 2005| accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which originated in 1999.

'''The International Science Festival in Gothenburg''' (Swedish: '''Vetenskapsfestivalen''') is an annual [[festival]] in [[Gothenburg]] with science activities.

== About the festival ==
The International Science Festival in Gothenburg took place for the first time in April 1997 and is since then an annual recurrent event.
The purpose is to communicate science to the public and schools in an easy accessible and in a thought provoking manner&lt;!--check translation--&gt;. Another objective is to create a positive attitude to [[research]] and [[science]] which is intended to encourage [[Education in Sweden#Higher education|higher education]].

About {{nowrap|100 000 visitors}} come each year.&lt;ref name=vgforsok&gt;[http://www.vartgoteborg.se/prod/sk/vargotnu.nsf/1/utbildning,varldsrekordforsok_inleder_goteborgs_tolfte_vetenskapsfestival vartgoteborg.se - Världsrekordförsök inleder Göteborgs tolfte vetenskapsfestival], Vårt Göteborg, 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the largest popular science event in [[Sweden]]&lt;ref name=festhome&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061101015134/http://www.goteborg.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=1601 goteborg.com - Festivalens hemsida] (archivelink 2006-11-01)&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest popular science events in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=fof08&gt;[http://www.fof.se/index.lasso?id=08364c Forskning och framsteg, 3/08 sid 64] (dead link 2012-04-24)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Edward Oglethorpe''' (22 December 1696&lt;ref&gt;Dates follow the Julian calendar up to 2 September 1752 and the Gregorian calendar thereafter.   Britain and her American colonies changed on that date and the following day was 14 September.   The intervening eleven days were omitted.&lt;/ref&gt; – 30 June 1785) was a British soldier, Member of Parliament, and philanthropist, as well as the founder of the [[colony of Georgia]]. As a social reformer, he hoped to resettle Britain's worthy poor in the New World, initially focusing on those in [[debtors' prison]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"James Edward Oglethorpe," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', accessed 13 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
James Oglethorpe was born in Surrey, the son of Sir [[Theophilus Oglethorpe]] (1650–1702) of Westbrook Place, [[Godalming]], and his wife [[Eleanor Oglethorpe|Eleanor Lady Oglethorpe]] (1662–1732). He entered [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]] in 1714, but in the same year left to join the army of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]. Through the recommendation of [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]] he became aide-de-camp to the prince, and during the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18]] he served with distinction in the campaign against the Turks.

After his return to England, he was elected Member of Parliament for [[Haslemere]] in 1722. He became a leading humanitarian, and in 1728 he advocated reform of the terrible conditions experienced by sailors in the British Royal Navy by publishing an anonymous pamphlet, 'The Sailors Advocate.'&lt;ref&gt;Julie Anne Sweet, "The British Sailors' Advocate: James Oglethorpe's First Philanthropic Venture," ''Georgia Historical Quarterly,'' Spring 2007, Vol. 91 Issue 1, ppd
 1–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pageant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Thomas|title=The American Pageant: A History ofRepublic|publisher=D.C. Heath and Company|location=Canada|year=1971|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding of Georgia===
In 1728, three years before conceiving the Georgia colony, Oglethorpe chaired a Parliamentary committee on prison reform.  The committee documented horrendous abuses in three debtors' prisons. As a result of the committee's actions, many debtors were released from prison with no means of support. Oglethorpe viewed this as part of the larger problem of urbanisation, which was depleting the countryside of productive  people and depositing them in cities, particularly London, where they often became impoverished or resorted to criminal activity. To address this problem, Oglethorpe and a group of associates, many of whom served on the prison committee, petitioned in 1730 to form the [[Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America]]. The petition was finally approved in 1732, and the first ship, led by Oglethorpe, departed for the New World in November.&lt;ref&gt;Diary of the Viscount Percival, I: 90 (1 April 1730); Saye, Albert, "Genesis of Georgia," Georgia Historical Quarterly, XXIV: (3): 191–201; Saye, Albert, "Was Georgia a Debtor Colony?", Georgia Historical Quarterly, XXIV (5): 323–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oglethorpe and the Trustees formulated a contractual, multi-tiered plan for the settlement of Georgia (see the [[The Oglethorpe Plan|Oglethorpe Plan]]). The plan envisioned a system of "agrarian equality", designed to support and perpetuate an economy based on family farming, and prevent social disintegration associated with unregulated urbanisation. Land ownership was limited to fifty acres, a grant that included a town lot, a garden plot near town, and a forty-five-acre farm. Self-supporting colonists were able to obtain larger grants, but such grants were structured in fifty-acre increments tied to the number of indentured servants supported by the grantee. Servants would receive a land grant of their own upon completing their term of service. No one was permitted to acquire additional land through purchase or inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Mills, ed., General Oglethorpe's Georgia, Colonial Letters, 1733–1743, Savannah: Beehive Press, 1990, 4 July 1739; Moore, A Voyage to Georgia, Fort Frederica Association, 2002, originally published by author in London, 1744, see page 22; Oglethorpe, James Edward, Some Account of the Design of the Trustees for establishing colonies in America, Rodney M. Baine and Phinizy Spalding, eds., Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1990; Diary of the Viscount Percival, 1: 303; 1: 370 (1 Dec 1732, 30 April 1733).&lt;/ref&gt;

With Oglethorpe on that ship were cotton seeds provided by the Chelsea Medicinal Garden in London.  Originally established by the Apothecaries' Company in 1673 for the cultivation and study of medicinal plants (many hospitals are nearby, including the Royal Hospital), the Garden's mission soon expanded to collect and study plants, shrubs, and trees from all over the world.  The cotton seeds given to Oglethorpe (and his colony's success in growing cotton) were instrumental in establishing the cotton industry in the U.S. South.&lt;ref&gt;''Frommers Walking Tours of London'', Second Edition, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed below, the plan for the colony was originally anti-slavery, emphasizing small family-owned farms.  But economic pressures eventually led to the lifting of the ban on slavery, as described below—and slavery was indispensable to the rise of large cotton-growing plantations throughout the Deep South.

Oglethorpe and the first colonists arrived at South Carolina on the ship ''Anne'' in late 1732, and settled near the present site of [[Savannah, Georgia]] on 1 February 1733. He negotiated with the [[Yamacraw]] tribe for land (Oglethorpe became great friends with Chief [[Tomochichi]], who was the chief of the Creek Indian village of Yamacraw), and built a series of defensive forts, most notably [[Fort Frederica]], of which substantial remains can still be visited. He then returned to England and arranged to have slavery banned in Georgia after being emotionally moved by an intercepted letter from [[Ayuba Suleiman Diallo]], a slave in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, J.(2011). The Red Atlantic: Transoceanic Cultural Exchanges. ''The American Indian Quarterly''35(3), 418-463. University of Nebraska Press. Retrieved April 8, 2015, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt; (For more on the story of Oglethorpe's involvement, see [[Ayuba Suleiman Diallo]]'s Wikipedia page.)  Oglethorpe and his fellow trustees were granted a [[royal charter]] for the Province of Georgia between the [[Savannah River|Savannah]] and [[Altamaha River|Altamaha]] rivers on 9 June 1732.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ga01.htm|title=The Avalon Project : Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy|work=yale.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040607095737/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ga01.htm|archivedate=7 June 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia was a key contested area, lying in between the English Carolinas and Spanish Florida. It was Oglethorpe's idea that British debtors should be released from prison and sent to Georgia. Although it is often repeated that this would theoretically rid Britain of its so-called undesirable elements, in fact it was Britain's "worthy poor" whom Oglethorpe wanted in Georgia. Ultimately, few debtors ended up in Georgia.  The colonists included many Scots whose pioneering skills greatly assisted the colony, and many of Georgia's new settlers consisted of poor English tradesmen and artisans and religious refugees from [[Switzerland]], France and Germany, as well as a number of Jewish refugees. There were also 150 Salzburger Protestants who had been expelled by edict from the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]] in present-day Austria (see [[Salzburg#Religious conflict|Religious conflict in Salzburg]]), and established the settlement of [[Ebenezer, Georgia|Ebenezer]] near Savannah. The colony's charter provided for acceptance of all religions except [[Roman Catholicism]]. The ban on Roman Catholic settlers was based on the colony's proximity to the hostile settlements in [[Spanish Florida]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

On 21 February 1734, Oglethorpe established the first [[Masonic Lodge]] within the British Colony of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solomonslodge.com/whoweare/lodgehistory.html |title=SOLOMON'S LODGE NO. 1, F. &amp; A. M |publisher=Solomonslodge.com |date=21 February 1934 |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314190419/http://www.solomonslodge.com/whoweare/lodgehistory.html |archivedate=14 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now known as [[Solomon's Lodge, Savannah|Solomon's Lodge]] No. 1, F. &amp; A. M. it is the "Oldest Continuously Operating English Constituted Lodge of Freemasons in the Western Hemisphere". For a period in 1736, Oglethorpe's secretary was [[Charles Wesley]], later well known as a hymnwriter of [[Methodism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/131christians/poets/charleswesley.html |title=Charles Wesley &amp;#124; Christian History |publisher=Christianitytoday.com |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He built a home outside the walls of Fort Fredrica (GPS Lat: 31.12.59.779 Long: 81.22.41.7600) that is marked by a small historical marker.

Owing to the colony's primary role as a military buffer between English and Spanish-held territories, the original model for the colonisation of Georgia excluded the use of slave labour, fearing that runaway slaves could internally weaken the colony and assist the enemy at [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. But, instead of slaves defecting southwards to the Spanish, runaways from the Carolinas found refuge in Georgia, thus irritating its northern neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spalding|first1=Phinizy|last2=Jackson|first2=Harvey H.|title=Oglethorpe in perspective : Georgia's founder after two hundred years|date=1989|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=0585118981|page=77|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=20252&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;ebv=EB&amp;ppid=pp_77|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banning of slavery also reduced the work force, and this was felt to be a constraint on Georgia's early economic growth. Many settlers thus began to oppose Oglethorpe, regarding him as a misguided and "perpetual dictator". Many new settlers soon set their eyes on [[South Carolina]] as a less restrictive and, they hoped, a more profitable place to settle. In 1743, after Oglethorpe had left the colony, the ban on slavery was lifted. Various forces united including the English who always urged it and as a result large numbers of slaves were soon imported.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Cornelia Cooper, ''James Oglethorpe: The Founder of Georgia'', p. 186,195&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734 Oglethorpe visited Britain aboard {{HMS|Aldborough|1727|6}}, taking with him a delegation of [[Creek Indians]],&lt;ref name="Power2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan C. Power|title=Art of the Cherokee: Prehistory to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPVEos7PKIgC&amp;pg=PA71|date=1 January 2007|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2766-2|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; who met [[King George II of Britain|George II]] and his family at [[Kensington Palace]]. Oglethorpe was widely acclaimed in London, although his expansionism was not welcomed in all quarters. The [[Duke of Newcastle]], who directed British foreign policy, had tried to restrain James Oglethorpe's efforts in the colony for fear of offending the Spanish, whom Newcastle wished unsuccessfully to court as an ally. Newcastle eventually relented, and became a supporter of the colony admitting "it will now be pretty difficult to give up Georgia".&lt;ref&gt;Browning p.88&lt;/ref&gt; The colony's existence was one of several disputes which worsened Anglo-Spanish relations in the late 1730s.&lt;ref name="Cate"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Cate | first =Margaret Davis | title =Fort Frederica and the Battle of Bloody Marsh | journal =The Georgia Historical Quarterly | volume =27 | issue =2 | page =112 | publisher =Georgia Historical Society | location =Georgia, USA | date =June 1943 | jstor =40576871 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1740, during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]], fought between British Georgia and Spanish Florida as part of a larger conflict, the [[War of Austrian Succession]], Oglethorpe was responsible for a number of successful raids on Spanish forts,&lt;ref name="Marley2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Marley|title=Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkgGVTOr2EsC&amp;pg=PA385|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-100-8|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the unsuccessful [[Siege of St. Augustine (1740)|Siege of St. Augustine]] in 1740. Oglethorpe showed poor military leadership but he received little help from South Carolina or from his Indian allies, from the Ordnance Board, or from the Royal Navy, despite his best efforts to gain their support.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney E. Baine, "General James Oglethorpe and the Expedition against St. Augustine," ''Georgia Historical Quarterly,'' June 2000, Vol. 84 Issue 2, pp 197–229&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Oglethorpe's most valuable Indian allies in this siege were the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creeks]], influenced by [[Mary Musgrove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proceedings of the President and Assistants Assembled for the Colony of Georgia|url=http://cdm.georgiaarchives.org:2011/cdm/ref/collection/adhoc/id/2671|website=General Trustee Records, Colony of Georgia, RG 049-02-019|publisher=Georgia Archives|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Indian name was Coosaponakeesa (lovely fawn), and she was married to John Musgrove, a trader. Following the failed attempt to strike against Florida, Oglethorpe commanded British forces during the [[Spanish invasion of Georgia]], defeating them at the [[Battle of Bloody Marsh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sutherland|first1=Patrick|title=Account of the Battle of Bloody Marsh|url=http://cdm.georgiaarchives.org:2011/cdm/ref/collection/adhoc/id/1000|website=Georgia Records from Duke University, 1988-0015m|publisher=Georgia Archives|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forcing them to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Frank, ''Creeks and Southerners: biculturalism on the early American frontier'' (2005) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Britain===
After his exploits in Georgia, Oglethorpe returned to London in 1743 and rose steadily through the ranks of the British Army. He would never return to Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweet|first1=Julie Anne|title='These Difficulties ... rather animate than daunt me': James Oglethorpe as a Leader|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2015|volume=99|issue=3|page=131|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=111013093&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that he returned to Europe under a pseudonym, with the assistance of [[James Francis Edward Keith|Field Marshal Keith]].

==Jacobite peerage==
On the death of his brother [[Theophilus Oglethorpe, Jr.]] in about 1737, he inherited the title of Baron Oglethorpe of Oglethorpe in the [[Jacobite peerage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/jacobitepeerage00unkngoog#page/n160/mode/2up Ruvigny's The Jacobite peerage, baronetage, knightage and grants of honour, PP 136-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacobite Rebellion===
{{Main|Jacobite rising of 1745}}
These were the days of the [[Charles Edward Stuart|"Young Pretender"]] and incursions by the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] troops from Scotland into the [[North of England]]. Oglethorpe had been busy forming a unit of Rangers which were to be shipped out to defend Georgia from future Spanish attacks. He immediately put his troops at the disposal of the government forces, under the command of the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], who were attempting to suppress the rebellion. Oglethorpe and his troops joined with Cumberland at [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and attempted to harry the retreating Jacobite army as they tried to escape back to Scotland. He fought a skirmish at [[Shap Fell]] in [[Westmorland]], but he was forced to break off the engagement by the intense weather and take shelter for the night. Overnight the Jacobites managed to withdraw and escape over the fell. Because of this Oglethorpe was court-martialled on the accusation of not pursuing the invaders more aggressively. He was acquitted, attained the rank of General, but never again given a command.&lt;ref&gt;Amos Aschbach Ettinger, ''James Edward Oglethorpe, imperial idealist'' (1968) p 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a strong supporter of the [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|British war effort in the Seven Years War]], Oglethorpe took no active role in the conflict.

===Retirement===
In 1785, Oglethorpe visited [[John Adams]] (the first US minister plenipotentiary to the [[Court of St. James's]], i.e., the first [[US ambassador to Britain]]) shortly after the latter arrived in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodgers|first1=Thomas G.|title=Colonials collide at Bloody Marsh|journal=Military History|date=1996|volume=13|issue=4|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting included an expression by Oglethorpe of his sadness at the ill-will that had existed between the countries.

Oglethorpe died at [[Cranham]] in 1785, and was buried at the centre of All Saints' parish church which immediately adjoins [[Cranham Hall]] (rebuilt c. 1790, but sketched prior by [[John Pridden]] in 1789). Elizabeth survived him a few years and was subsequently buried at his side. The site was lost until re-discovered by [[Thornwell Jacobs]] in 1922.

[[Oglethorpe County, Georgia|Oglethorpe County]] and [[Oglethorpe University]] in Atlanta, as well as the town of [[Oglethorpe, Georgia]] are all named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/in_depth.asp |title=Oglethorpe University : In Depth |publisher=Oglethorpe.edu |date= |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510132401/http://oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/in_depth.asp |archivedate=10 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, The James Oglethorpe Primary School in Cranham is named after him.

In 1986 the Corps of Cadets at the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega, Georgia officially adopted the name of the unit as the "Boar's Head Brigade". The name came from the Boar's Head on the Department Crest approved by the U.S. Army Adjutant General on August 11, 1937.  The Boar's Head was a part of the family crest of James Oglethorpe, and is a symbol of fighting spirit and hospitality so deeply a part of Georgia's heritage and the spirit of the Corps of Cadets at the University of North Georgia.

All Saints' was rebuilt c.1871. However, the new church stands on the same foundations as the old one, and Oglethorpe's poetic marble memorial is on the south wall of the chancel, as before. In the 1930s, the president of Oglethorpe University [[Thornwell Jacobs]] excavated the Oglethorpe family vault in the centre of the chancel at All Saints', although permission to translate the General's relics to a purpose-built shrine at Oglethorpe University (Atlanta) had been refused by the Archdeacon.

There is a [[bronze]] [[statue]] in [[Squares of Savannah, Georgia#Chippewa Square|Chippewa Square]], [[Savannah, Georgia]], created by sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]] and unveiled in 1910.  Oglethorpe faces south, toward Georgia's one-time enemy in [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] Florida, and his sword is drawn.

Oglethorpian anniversaries have since led to the donation of the altar rail at All Saints' by a ladies charity in Georgia. In 1996, then Georgia [[governor of Georgia|Governor]] [[Zell Miller]] attended Oglethorpe tercentenary festivities in [[Godalming]] and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford.&lt;ref name="ginfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/jeo300/trip.htm |title=Photo Review: Oglethorpe Tercentenary Delegation to England |publisher=GeorgiaInfo, [[University of Georgia]] |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009035809/http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/jeo300/trip.htm |archivedate= 9 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] holds two portraits of Oglethorpe, a drawing of the general as an old man, which hangs in the Senior Common Room, and a portrait in oils, which hangs in the Breakfast Room.

'''Lester Lawrence Lessig III''' (born June 3, 1961) is an American academic, attorney, and [[political activist]]. He is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at [[Harvard Law School]] and the former director of the [[Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10519/Lessig/|title=Harvard Law School Faculty Lawrence Lessig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig was a [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|candidate]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s nomination for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], but withdrew before the primaries.

Lessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on [[copyright]], [[trademark]], and [[radio frequency]] spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded [[Creative Commons]], a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at [[Stanford Law School]], where he founded the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]], and at the [[University of Chicago]]. He is a former board member of the [[Free Software Foundation]] and [[Software Freedom Law Center]]; the Washington, D.C. lobbying groups [[Public Knowledge]] and [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]]; and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Lawrence.

As a political activist, Lessig has called for state-based activism to promote substantive reform of government with a [[Second Constitutional Convention of the United States|Second Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref name=twsNovQ11&gt;{{cite news |author=Alesh Houdek |title=Has a Harvard Professor Mapped Out the Next Step for Occupy Wall Street? |work=The Atlantic |quote=Lawrence Lessig's call for state-based activism on behalf of a Constitutional Convention could provide the uprooted movement with a political project for winter |date=November 16, 2011 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/has-a-harvard-professor-mapped-out-the-next-step-for-occupy-wall-street/247561/ |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, he launched a crowd-funded [[political action committee]] which he termed [[Mayday PAC]] with the purpose of electing candidates to [[United States Congress|Congress]] who would pass [[campaign finance reform]].&lt;ref&gt;Naureen Khan, May 2, 2014, Al Jazeera, [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/2/a-super-pac-to-endallsuperpacs.html May Day PAC wants to end all Super PACs], Accessed May 7, 2014, "kick-start May Day PAC, which, if successful, will help elect enough like-minded lawmakers to Congress in 2014 and 2016 to pass campaign finance reform&amp;nbsp;...

[http://maplight.org/board "Board Members"] at MapLight.org&lt;/ref&gt; He serves on the advisory boards of the ''Democracy Café''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/penn-alum-lawrence-lessig-speak-national-constitution-center-democracy-caf/ Penn Alum Lawrence Lessig to Speak at National Constitution Center for Democracy Café] Penn News, March 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sunlight Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunlightfoundation.com/board_of_directors/ Board and Advisory Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016012604/http://sunlightfoundation.com/board_of_directors/ |date=October 16, 2010 }} Sunlight Foundation, February 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Lessig announced that he was exploring a possible candidacy for President of the United States, promising to run if his exploratory committee raised $1 million by [[Labor Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/harvard-professor-hits-dollar1m-benchmark-for-white-house-bid/ar-AAe0WvJ?ocid=ansmsnnews11|title=Harvard professor hits $1M benchmark for White House bid|work=msn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="why"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/lawrence-lessig-running-for-president-20150811 | title=Why Exactly Is Lawrence Lessig Considering Running for President? | work=[[National Journal]] | date=August 11, 2015 | accessdate=August 11, 2015 | author=Foran, Clare}}&lt;/ref&gt; After accomplishing this, on September 6, 2015, Lessig announced that he was entering the race [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|to become a candidate]] for the 2016 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016|presidential nomination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Hayley|title=Harvard Professor Larry Lessig Says He's Running for President|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harvard-professor-larry-lessig-running-president/story?id=33568066|accessdate=September 6, 2015|publisher=ABC News|date=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig has described his candidacy as a referendum on [[campaign finance reform]] and [[electoral reform]] legislation. He stated that, if elected, he would serve a full term as president with his proposed reforms as his legislative priorities.&lt;ref name="Marans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawrence-lessig-totally-stupid-resign-presidency_5622acdde4b02f6a900c9bad|title=Lawrence Lessig Withdraws 'Totally Stupid' Plan To Resign Presidency|last=Marans|first=Daniel|date=October 17, 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his campaign in November 2015, citing rule changes from the Democratic Party that precluded him from appearing in the televised debates.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4IsqmMqCEo |title=The Democrats have changed the rules |date=2015-11-02 |last=Lessig2016.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Lessig earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in economics and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in management ([[Wharton School]]) from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] degree in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]) in England, and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1989. After graduating from law school, he [[Law clerk|clerked]] for a year for Judge [[Richard Posner]], at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and another year for Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] at the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence |first=Lessig |title=Curriculum Vitae |url=http://www.lessig.org/info/resume/ |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707013742/http://www.lessig.org/info/resume/ |archivedate=July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig started his academic career at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he was professor from 1991 to 1997. As co-director of the Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe there, he helped the newly-independent [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] draft a constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/951207/georgia.shtml|title=Center helps Eastern European countries shape constitutions|publisher=|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2000, he was at [[Harvard Law School]], holding for a year the chair of Berkman Professor of Law, affiliated with the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]].&lt;ref name="resume" /&gt; He subsequently joined [[Stanford Law School]], where he established the school's [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]].&lt;ref name="short-bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence |first=Lessig |title=Short Biography |url=http://www.lessig.org/info/bio// |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722035945/http://www.lessig.org/info/bio/ |archivedate=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig returned to Harvard in July 2009 as professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics.&lt;ref name="hl-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence Lessig named professor of law at HLS, director of Harvard's Edmond J.

Furman Professor of Law and Leadership; his chair lecture was titled "Aaron's Laws: Law and Justice in a Digital Age."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HAw1i4gOU4 Lessig on "Aaron's Laws – Law and Justice in a Digital Age"].

===In popular culture===
Lessig was portrayed by [[Christopher Lloyd]] in "[[The Wake Up Call]]", during season 6 of ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2005/02/09/lessig-portrayed-on.html|title=Lessig portrayed on tonight's West Wing|work=Boing Boing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background==
[[File:Jonathan Zittrain and Lawrence Lessig (Google DC, March 20 2008).jpg|thumbnail|Lessig speaking with Harvard internet law professor [[Jonathan Zittrain]]]]
Lessig has been politically [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] since studying philosophy at Cambridge in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, two influential [[Conservatism|conservative]] judges, Judge [[Richard Posner]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], selected him to serve as a law clerk, choosing him for his supposed "brilliance" rather than for his ideology and effectively making him the "token liberal" on their staffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2010/09/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-how-political-is-it/|title=Supreme Court Clerk Hiring: Is It Becoming More Political?|work=Above the Law|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posner would later call him "the most distinguished law professor of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/lessig_pr.html|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|author=Steven Levy|date=October 1, 2002|work=WIRED|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of [[Teenage Republicans]], served as the Youth Governor for Pennsylvania through the [[YMCA Youth and Government]] program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymcapa.org/ |title=YMCA Youth and Government Pennsylvania (PA State YMCA) |publisher=Ymcapa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1978, and almost pursued a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political career.

What was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy and develop his changed political values. During this time, he also traveled in the [[Eastern Bloc]], where he acquired a lifelong interest in [[Eastern Europe]]an law and politics.

Lessig remains skeptical of government intervention but favors some regulation, calling himself "a constitutionalist." On one occasion, Lessig also commended the [[John McCain]] campaign for discussing [[fair use]] rights in a letter to [[YouTube]] where it took issue with YouTube for indulging overreaching copyright claims leading to the removal of various campaign videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/mccainpalin_to_youtube_get_rea.html |title=McCain/Palin to YouTube: Get real (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521070933/http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/mccainpalin_to_youtube_get_rea.html |archivedate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and computer activism==
[[File:Lawrence lessig, joi ito.jpg|thumbnail|Lessig with fellow Creative Commons board member [[Joi Ito]]]]

==="Code is law"===
In computer science, "code" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the [[source code]]). In law, "code" can refer to the texts that constitute [[statutory law]]. In his 1999 book ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]]'', Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for [[social control]], leading to his dictum that "Code is law." Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as ''[[Code: Version 2.0]]'' in December 2006.

Lessig has been a proponent of the [[remix culture]] since the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2004_fall/lessig.htm |date=2004-11-18 |accessdate=2016-02-27 |title=Remix Is a Cultural Right, Lessig Says |publisher=law.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2008 book [[Remix (book)|''Remix'']]&lt;ref&gt;[http://remix.lessig.org/remix.php Remix] on lessig.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix Remix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402060619/https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix |date=April 2, 2016 }} on [[scribd.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; he presents this as a desirable cultural practice distinct from piracy. Lessig further articulates remix Culture as intrinsic to technology and the Internet. Remix culture is therefore an amalgam of practice, creativity, "read/write" culture and the hybrid economy.

According to Lessig, the problem with the remix comes when it is at odds with stringent US copyright law. He has compared this to the failure of [[Prohibition]], both in its ineffectiveness and in its tendency to normalize criminal behavior. Instead he proposes more lenient licensing, namely [[Creative Commons license]]s, as a remedy to maintain "rule of law" while combating plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/778455386|title=The social media reader|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|publisher=New York University Press|others=Mandiberg, Michael,|year=2012|isbn=9780814764077|location=New York|pages=155–169|chapter=REMIX: How Creativity is Being Strangled by the Law|oclc=778455386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free culture===
[[File:Aaron Swartz and Lawrence Lessig.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lessig and [[Aaron Swartz]] in 2002 at the launch party for [[Creative Commons]]]]
On March 28, 2004 he was elected to the FSF's board of directors.&lt;ref name="Fsf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/about/leadership.html |title=Leadership – Free Software Foundation |publisher=Fsf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of "[[Free-culture movement|free culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/ |title=free_culture |publisher=Randomfoo.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supports [[free and open-source software]] and [[open spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/spectrum/ |title=Spectrum Policy: Property or Commons? |publisher=Cyberlaw.stanford.edu |date=2003-03-02 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his free culture keynote at the [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention]] 2002, a few minutes of his speech was about [[software patent]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/|title=free_culture|work=randomfoo.net}} Lessig discusses software patents from time 17:38 to 20:38 of the audio recording&lt;/ref&gt; which he views as a rising threat to [[free software]], [[open source software]] and innovation.

In March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the [[Digital Universe]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-14-2006/0004319554&amp;EDATE= |title=Digital Universe Adds Leading Internet Expert Lawrence Lessig to Board of Advisors |location=California |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 [[Wikimania]] conference. In December 2006, his lecture '' On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code'' was one of the highlights at [[Chaos Communication Congress|23C3 ''Who can you trust?'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/hmdmhdfmhdjmzdtjmzdtzktdkztdjz/commons |title=commons |year=2011 |id=google video docid=7661663613180520595 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig claimed in 2009 that, because 70% of young people obtain digital information from illegal sources, the law should be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Lawrence Lessig |title=Colbert Nation |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215454/january-08-2009/lawrence-lessig |publisher=Comedy Central |date=January 8, 2009 |time=2:16 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a foreword to the [[Freesouls]] book project, Lessig makes an argument in favor of amateur artists in the world of digital technologies: "there is a different class of amateur creators that digital technologies have&amp;nbsp;... enabled, and a different kind of creativity has emerged as a consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freesouls.cc/essays/00-foreword-lawrence-lessig.html|title=Freesouls - Foreword by Lawrence Lessig|work=freesouls.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig is also a well-known critic of [[copyright term]] extensions.

===Net neutrality===
[[File:Lessig-Wales-20070615.jpg|thumb|Lessig and [[Jimmy Wales]] at the iCommons iSummit07 in [[Dubrovnik]]]]
Lessig has long been known to be a supporter of [[net neutrality]]. In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify [[Michael Powell (attorney)|Michael Powell]]'s four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, "Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong."&lt;ref&gt;CBC NEWS. Google accused of turning its back on net neutrality. December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative reform===
Despite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that creative professionals' work, many of them independent, would become more easily and quickly available if bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Clark. Software Freedom Fighters. ''The National Journal'' 33(30), July 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lessig has repeatedly taken a stance that privatization through legislation like that seen in the 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications is not the best way to help the Internet grow. He said, "When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place," "My claim is that we should focus on the values of liberty. If there is not government to insist on those values, then who?" "The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Mills. Domain games: Internet leaves the U.S. nest. ''InfoWorld Daily News''. October 13, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}{{See also|Eldred v. Ashcroft}}
From 1999 to 2002, Lessig represented a high-profile challenge the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]]. Working with the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]], Lessig led the team representing the plaintiff in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/10/lessig-3/|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff in the case was joined by a group of publishers who frequently published work in the [[Public domain in the United States|public domain]] and a large number of ''[[Amicus curiae|amici]]'' including the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[American Association of Law Libraries]], the [[Bureau of National Affairs]], and the [[College Art Association]].

In March 2003, Lessig acknowledged severe disappointment with his Supreme Court defeat in the Eldred copyright-extension case, where he unsuccessfully tried to convince Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had sympathies for de-regulation, to back his "market-based" approach to intellectual property regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig Backs Away From Copy Fights In Courts, Congress. Washington Internet Daily 4 (42). March 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Lawrence Lessig brought suit against Liberation Music PTY Ltd., after Liberation issued a takedown notice of one of Lessig's lectures on YouTube which had used the song "[[Lisztomania (song)|Lisztomania]]" by the band [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]], whom Liberation Music represents.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/document/lessig-v-liberation-music-complaint |title=Lessig v.

===''Killswitch''===
{{Main|Killswitch (film)}}
In October 2014, ''Killswitch'', a film featuring Lawrence Lessig, as well as [[Aaron Swartz]], [[Tim Wu]], and [[Edward Snowden]] received its World Premiere at the [[Woodstock Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best Editing. In the film, Lessig frames the story of two young hacktivists, Swartz and Snowden, who symbolize the disruptive and dynamic nature of the Internet. The film reveals the emotional bond between Lessig and Swartz, and how it was Swartz (the mentee) that challenged Lessig (the mentor) to engage in the political activism that has led to Lessig's crusade for [[campaign finance reform]].&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite news |last1=von Busack |first1=Richard |title=Breaking the Internet: Killswitch Screens at Cinequest |url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/cinequest-2015/Killswitch-Edward-Snowden.html |date=February 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |publisher=Metro Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocreg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Swegles |first1=Fred |title=Battle for Internet Control Fuels O.C. -produced Movie |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/film-657978-internet-big.html/ |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 16, 2015 |publisher=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, ''Killswitch'' was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington DC by Congressman [[Alan Grayson]]. The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on [[Net Neutrality]]. Lessig, Congressman Grayson, and [[Free Press (organization)]] CEO Craig Aaron spoke about the importance of protecting net neutrality and the free and open Internet.&lt;ref name="house1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grayson |first1=Alan |title=Grayson Screen Award Winning "Killswitch" Documentary |url=http://grayson.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/330-grayson-screens-award-winning-killswitch-documentary |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |publisher=Congressman Grayson's House of Rep Official Web Page |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227162553/http://grayson.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/330-grayson-screens-award-winning-killswitch-documentary |archivedate=February 27, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Price That You Pay for Rocking The Boat |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-alan-grayson/aaron-swartz-killswitch_b_6957576.html |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Grayson states that Killswitch is "One of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet -- and access to information itself.".&lt;ref name="house1"/&gt; [[Richard von Busack]] of the [[Metro Silicon Valley]], writes of ''Killswitch'', "Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Café".&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; Fred Swegles of the [[Orange County Register]], remarks, "Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by ''Killswitch'', a gripping and fast-paced documentary."&lt;ref name="ocreg"/&gt; Kathy Gill of [[GeekWire]] asserts that "''Killswitch'' is much more than a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human centered story. A large part of that connection comes from Lessig and his relationship with Swartz."&lt;ref name="geekwire.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gill|first1=Kathy|title=Lawrence Lessig at 'Killswitch' Seattle Premiere: Money, Politics, and the Battle for the Internet|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/lawrence-lessig-seattle-money-politics-battle-internet/|accessdate=June 5, 2015|agency=GeekWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Electors Trust===

[[File:Jack Abramoff and Lawrence Lessig at "In the Dock" 2011 (2).jpg|thumbnail|right|Lessig having a discussion with former lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]]]]
At the iCommons iSummit 07, Lessig announced that he would stop focusing his attention on copyright and related matters and work on [[political corruption]] instead, as the result of a transformative conversation with [[Aaron Swartz]], a young internet prodigy whom Lessig met through his work with [[Creative Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/required_reading_the_next_10_y_1.html |title=Required Reading: the next 10 years (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116071137/http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/required_reading_the_next_10_y_1.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new work was partially facilitated through his [[wiki]], Lessig Wiki, which he has encouraged the public to use to document cases of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/just_because_im_not_working_do.html |title=Lessig's blog July 29, 2007 11:55pm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015180516/http://lessig.org/blog/2007/06/just_because_im_not_working_do.html |archivedate=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig criticized the [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] phenomenon in which legislators and staffers leave office to become [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbyists]] and have become beholden to special interests.&lt;ref name=twsDecM9009&gt;{{cite news |author=Lawrence Lessig |title=How to Get Our Democracy Back

In February 2008, a [[Facebook]] group formed by law professor [[John Palfrey]] encouraged him to run for Congress from [[California's 12th congressional district]], the seat vacated by the death of U.S. Representative [[Tom Lantos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://draftlessig.org/ |title=Draft Lessig – Change Congress |publisher=Draftlessig.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, after forming an "exploratory project", he decided not to run for the vacant seat.&lt;ref name="blog-notrunning"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://www.lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html |title=On why I am not running (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116042748/http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rootstrikers===
{{Main|Rootstrikers}}
Despite having decided to forgo running for Congress himself, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption.&lt;ref name="blog-notrunning" /&gt; To this end, he worked with political consultant [[Joe Trippi]] to launch a web based project called "[[Change Congress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/stanford-law-pr.html |title=Stanford Law Professor Larry Lessig Bets 'Wikipedia' Approach Will Transform Congress &amp;#124; Threat Level from Wired.com |publisher=Blog.wired.com |date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference on March 20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress website would help provide technological tools voters could use to hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of money on politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visualwebcaster.com/event.asp?id=46510 |title=Sunlight Foundation Webcast |publisher=Visualwebcaster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a board member of [[MAPLight.org]], a nonprofit research group illuminating the connection between money and politics.

[[Change Congress]] later became ''Fix Congress First'', and was finally named [[Rootstrikers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootstrikers.org/whoweare.php Who We Are] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223040848/https://www.rootstrikers.org/whoweare.php |date=December 23, 2011 }}, Rootstrikers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootstrikers.org/about.php About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111155608/https://www.rootstrikers.org/about.php |date=January 11, 2012 }}, Rootstrikers&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Lessig announced that Rootstrikers would join forces with [[Dylan Ratigan]]'s ''Get Money Out'' campaign, under the umbrella of the United Republic organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitedrepublic.org/2011/rootstrikers-and-united-republic/ Rootstrikers and United Republic], Lawrence Lessig, United Republic, November 16, 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230017/http://unitedrepublic.org/2011/rootstrikers-and-united-republic/ |date=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitedrepublic.org/about-us About Us], United Republic {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207223737/http://unitedrepublic.org/about-us |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rootstrikers subsequently came under the aegis of [[Demand Progress]], an organization co-founded by Aaron Swartz.

===Article V convention===

===New Hampshire Rebellion===
The [[Coalition for Open Democracy|New Hampshire Rebellion]] is a walk to raise awareness about corruption in politics.&lt;ref name="atlantic-2014"&gt;Lawrence Lessig, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-were-marching-across-new-hampshire-to-honor-aaron-swartz/282962/ "Why We're Marching Across New Hampshire to Honor Aaron Swartz"], ''The Atlantic'', January 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Harper, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/inside-the-beltway-self-awareness-and-the-science-/?page=all "Restless grassroots: New Hampshire 'Rebellion' declares their state is not for sale"] (Inside the Beltway column), ''Washington Times'', December 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;John Koziol, [http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150118/NEWS06/150119165 "NH Rebellion Marching Its Way to Concord for Reform"], ''New Hampshire Union Leader'', January 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 11 to 24, 2014, Lessig and many others, like New York activist [[Jeff Kurzon]], marched from [[Dixville Notch, New Hampshire]] to Nashua (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling "the systemic corruption in Washington".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Lessig chose this language over the related term "campaign finance reform," commenting that "Saying we need campaign finance reform is like referring to an alcoholic as someone who has a liquid intake problem."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The walk was to continue the work of NH Native [[Doris Haddock|Doris "Granny D" Haddock]], and in honor of deceased activist [[Aaron Swartz]].&lt;ref name="atlantic-2014" /&gt; The New Hampshire Rebellion marched 16 miles from Hampton to New Castle on the New Hampshire Seacoast.&lt;ref name="vasseur"&gt;Flore Vasseur, [https://medium.com/backchannel/larry-lessigs-long-walk-b96d80d34972 "The New Hampshire Rebellion: Larry Lessig's Long Walk"], ''The Medium'', December 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial location was also chosen because of its important and visible role in the quadrennial "New Hampshire primaries", the traditional first primary of the presidential election.&lt;ref name="vasseur" /&gt;

==2016 presidential candidacy==
{{main|Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016}}
Lessig announced the launch of his presidential campaign on September 6, 2015.
On August 11, 2015, Lessig announced that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|nomination]] for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref name="why"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exploring"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/11/politics/larry-lessig-presidential-campaign-exploration/index.html | title=Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig is exploring a long shot presidential bid | publisher=CNN.com | date=August 11, 2015 | accessdate=August 11, 2015 | author=Merica, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by [[Labor Day]] 2015.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt; The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Kristin (August 11, 2015) [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/2015/08/11/harvard-law-professor-exploring-presidential-run/lNQdSFZzDpMzCh0Uinz2aO/story.html "Harvard law professor wants to be president—for one day"], [[Boston.com]]. Retrieved August 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign was focused on a single issue: [[The Citizen Equality Act]], a proposal that couples [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] with other laws aimed at curbing [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering]] and ensuring [[Voter suppression in the United States|voting access]].&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt; As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt;

He announced the end of his campaign on November 2, 2015.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/2016-election/384828/|title=The 2016 U.S. Presidential Race: A Cheat Sheet|last=Graham|first=David|date=2 November 2015|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral College Reform==
In 2017, Lessig announced a movement to challenge the [[Plurality voting system|winner-take-all]] [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote allocation in the various states, called ''Equal Votes''.&lt;ref name="to171005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Douglas|title=Electoral-college reform would have defeated Donald Trump; now some Republicans back effort, seek action before 2020|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2017/10/electoral-college_reform_would.html|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=The Oregonian|date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig is counsel for plaintiffs in ''[[Nemanich v. Williams]]'', an electoral law case in Colorado.

==Awards and honors==
In 2002, Lessig received the [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]] from the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF).&lt;ref name="Fsf.org"/&gt; He also received the [[Scientific American|Scientific American 50 Award]] for having "argued against interpretations of copyright that could stifle innovation and discourse online."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-scientific-american-5-2002-11-11/|title=The Scientific American 50 Award|work=Scientific American|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2006, Lessig was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/april26/aaas-042606.html |title=Eight scholars elected to academy of arts and sciences |publisher=News-service.stanford.edu |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lessig was born in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], the son of Patricia, who sold real estate, and Lester L. "Jack" Lessig, an engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/lessig_pr.html|title=Wired 10.10: Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|work=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/newmedia/n146.xml|title=Lessig, Lawrence|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]].

In May 2005, it was revealed that Lessig had experienced [[sexual abuse]] by the director at the [[American Boychoir School]], which he had attended as an adolescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heilemann |first=John |url=http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index.html |title=Lawrence Lessig and John Hardwicke Fight Sexual Abuse and the American Boychoir School |publisher=Newyorkmetro.com |date=2005-05-21 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109184450/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index.html |archivedate=January 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig reached a settlement with the school in the past, under confidential terms. He revealed his experiences in the course of representing another student victim, John Hardwicke, in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://www.lessig.org/blog/2005/05/living_with_ghosts.html |title=living with ghosts (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116200950/http://lessig.org/blog/2005/05/living_with_ghosts.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, he succeeded in persuading the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] to restrict the scope of immunity radically, which had protected nonprofits that failed to prevent sexual abuse from legal liability.&lt;ref name="Hardwicke v. American Boychoir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/decisions/supreme/a-17-04.doc.html |title=Hardwicke v. American Boychoir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig is married to Bettina Neuefeind, a German-born Harvard University colleague. The two married in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2000-03-05/the-paul-revere-of-the-web&lt;/ref&gt; He and Neuefeind have three children: Willem, Teo, and Tess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hyperink.com/Personal-Life-b1404a12|title=Personal Life - Lawrence Lessig: A Biography|publisher=Hyperink.com|date=|accessdate=2015-08-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032036/http://www.hyperink.com/Personal-Life-b1404a12|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Lessig was appointed [[special master]] by Judge [[Thomas Penfield Jackson]] in 1997; the appointment was vacated by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/199806/97-5343a.txt |title=USCA-DC Opinions – Released On 1/21/2011 |publisher=Pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the appellate court ruled that the powers granted to Lessig exceeded the scope of the Federal statute providing for special masters; Judge Jackson then solicited Lessig's [[amicus brief]]
** Lessig said about this appointment: "Did Justice Jackson pick me to be his special master because he had determined I was the perfect mix of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Holmes]], and [[Ed Felten]]? No, I was picked because I was a Harvard Law Professor teaching the law of cyberspace.

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

A '''mommy track''' is a path in a woman's life that puts priority to being a [[mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mommy+track|title=Mommy track|accessdate=2015-09-05|publisher=Farlex dictionary}}&lt;br&gt;In turn citing: Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged, HarperCollins Publishers 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It can also specifically refer to work arrangements for [[women in the workforce]] that facilitate motherhood, such as flexible hours, but at the same time usually provides fewer opportunities for career advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mommy+track|title=Mommy track|accessdate=2015-09-05|publisher=Farlex dictionary}}&lt;br&gt;In turn citing: American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition. 2011 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/us/mommy-career-track-sets-off-a-furor.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Mommy Career Track Sets Off a Furor |author=Tamar Lewin |date=8 Mar 1989 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to the mommy track often go along with being a [[housewife]], "opting out" of the workforce, temporarily or even permanently. Women following the mommy track may be contrasted to [[career women]] who prioritize their careers more than having children.

Kingson]] introduced the term "mommy track" in an August 8, 1988, article in [[The New York Times]], in which she described the career hurdles faced by law firm associates who sacrificed advancement potential once they had children.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/us/women-in-the-law-say-path-is-limited-by-mommy-track.html?pagewanted=&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felice Schwartz]]’s 1989 article in the ''Harvard Business Journal'' is sometimes called the first discussion of the mommy track phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/03/the_mommy_track_turns_21.html |title=The 'Mommy Track' turns 21 |author=Angie Kim |date=31 March 2010 |work=[[Slate Magazine]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz claims in the article that while “the cost of employing women in management is greater than the cost of employing men,”&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; this greater cost is due primarily to gendered expectations of the workplace and women’s duties in raising children.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Schwartz wrote:
{{quote|The misleading metaphor of the [[glass ceiling]] suggests an invisible barrier constructed by corporate leaders to impede the upward mobility of women beyond the middle levels. A more appropriate metaphor, I believe, is the kind of cross-sectional diagram used in geology. The barriers to women’s leadership occur when potentially counterproductive layers of influence on women—maternity, tradition, socialization—meet management strata pervaded by the largely unconscious preconceptions, [[stereotypes]], and expectations of men. Such interfaces do not exist for men and tend to be impermeable for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schwartz's assertions generated widespread publicity and a new conversation about women in the workplace. ''[[The New York Times]],'' having coined the term in 1988, described ''mommy track'' in greater detail in a March 8, 1989 article, "Mommy Career Track Sets Off Furor" which discussed Schwartz's article and the response to it in the public sphere. The article described the mommy track as a phenomenon "in which women with family responsibilities are shunted into dead-end, lower-paying jobs."&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

==Wage gap for mothers==
{{Main|Motherhood penalty}}
Across different pay levels and [[socioeconomic]] groups, women’s earnings tend to plateau after giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Even when controlling for variables, on average mothers in all groups earn lower wages than non-mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this general drop in earnings, though, there are significant differences in mothers’ [[Gender pay gap|wage gaps]] between high-earning women and low-earning women.

===High-earning women===
High-earning women appear to bear much higher costs of [[childbirth]] than low-earning women. In the US, choosing to have children will force a woman to give up 21 to 33 percent of her lifetime earnings, a loss that could cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years after having children, a highly skilled woman with children remains at a pay level 24% lower than non-mothers even when time out of the workforce is taken into account.&lt;ref name="Wilde et al, p. 18"&gt;Wilde et al, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; This group of women also seems to face greater discrimination within the workplace; only 16% of all law firm partners are women, a discrepancy absent from lower-skilled professions.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-skilled women tend to have flatter wage-earning trajectories than their low-skilled counterparts after giving birth, primarily seen in a lack of wage growth.&lt;ref name="Kornberg, p. 200"&gt;Kornberg, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-earning women===
Low-earning women who have children are sacrificing about 10 to 14 percent of their total lifetime earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Even ten years after having children, a mother in the US in this income bracket earns wages that are about 12% lower than non-mother, low-skilled women.&lt;ref name="Wilde et al, p. 18"/&gt; This group of mothers tends to experience a one-time fall in pay immediately after childbirth of about 6%, but after that initial fall the wage gap between women with children and those without does not continue to grow over time.&lt;ref name="Kornberg, p. 200"/&gt;

==Part-time work and flexibility==
A theory frequently cited for why mothers earning lower wages than other women that is the fact that mothers tend to spend fewer hours in the workplace than non-mothers.&lt;ref name="Hymowitz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/miarticle.htm?id=7342 |title=Women Prefer the Mommy Track |author=Kay S. Hymowitz |date=4 August 2011 |work=[[Manhattan Institute]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report in 2014 by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] stated that employed men worked 52 minutes more than employed women on the days they worked, and that this difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working [[part-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm|title=American Time Use Survey|date=June 24, 2015|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time work and [[flextime]] or more flexible arrangements are seen as hallmarks of the mommy track, since they point to women not being in the workplace full-time. However, this is changing as more people—men and women alike—choose more flexible work arrangements that allow for more free time.&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt;

==Cultural pressures and influences==
In the years since the women’s liberation movement and [[second-wave feminism]], [[gender roles]] have become more complicated and less dogmatic.&lt;ref&gt;Blair-Loy, Mary. "Cultural Constructions of Family Schemas: The Case of Women Finance Executives." Gender and Society. Sage Publications, Inc. 15.5 (Oct. 2001), p. 690&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the modern ideal of “intensive parenting,” first described by Sharon Hays, ensures that mothers continue to take primary responsibility for raising children due to the engrained [[social norm]] that women are better nurturers.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Sharon. The Cultural Conditions of Motherhood. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996, p. 129. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the reasons that while both men and women report having increased trouble with their [[work-life balance]] after having a baby, women are the only ones whose hours working decrease as a response to this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, Mary E. and Mary C. Noonan. "The Mommy Track and Partnership: Temporary Delay or Dead End?" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. The American Academy of Political and Social Science 596 (Nov. 2004), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women who cannot afford to pay someone else to take care of [[domestic work]] are faced with the [[double burden]] of working outside of the home while continuing to complete the majority of domestic work in the home.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Arlie, with Anne Machung. The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home. New York, NY: Viking, 1989. Print. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cultural influence on mothers' decreased presence in the workforce is [[gender discrimination]] within the U.S. tax code. Since domestic labor in one’s own home is unpaid and untaxed, and women continue to do a majority of domestic labor as a result of societal norms, in many households it may seem less expensive for a woman to take care of this labor than to go to work and pay someone else to cook, clean, and care for children.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The tax code also sees men as the primary earners and women as secondary earners, so men benefit from joint filing while women’s earnings are frequently subject to higher taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many [[feminist]]s saw the idea of the mommy track as divisive to women and therefore one that could have a detrimental effect to the feminist cause. Since Schwartz’s initial article proposed sorting women into two categories based on their devotion to careers,&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; some saw this as a division between women that both forced them into narrow categories and ignored any existing differences between men.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

There is also an ongoing discussion of whether the wage gap that results from a mommy track is any sort of societal discrimination against women, or basically an effect of mothers choosing to spend more time away from work.&lt;ref name="Hymowitz"/&gt;

==Mommy track in different countries==

===United States===
In a 2005 study, in the US, it has been estimated that 31% of working mothers left the workplace (for an average of 2.2 years), most often precipitated by the birth of the second child.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, S. A., Luce, C. B., Shiller, P. &amp; Southwell,S (2005, March). The hidden brain drain: Off-ramps and on-ramps in women’s careers. Center for WorkLife. Policy/Harvard Business Review Research. Report, Product no. 9491. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the US was one of only three countries in the world (the other two being [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Suriname]]) that does not have laws that require employers to provide paid [[maternity leave]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-industrialized-nation-paid-maternity-leave/story?id=30852419&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan’s social norms, like those of the U.S., help to cause many women to move into part-time work upon having children. However, unlike the U.S., Japanese mothers rarely return to full-time work after having children.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; Even more so than other developed countries, Japan has an especially high proportion of women who work part-time, and a majority of those women are mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; Common business practices in Japan further penalize mothers who may have taken leave from the workplace at some point, due to companies choosing to only recruit directly from universities and setting upper limits on age for full-time positions.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] women have entered the workforce relatively recently. Throughout much of the 20th century, women faced many legal and social obstacles preventing them from working. Although in the late 1950s, the Netherlands made important legal changes, such as removing the [[marriage bar]] and the [[marital power]] of the husband, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved - prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family, reflecting the traditional structure of the society.&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045ae0e&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/Gender/publication/Netherlands_2015_Review_BPFA_Report_of_the_Netherlands_Government.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, according to ''[[The Economist]]'',  "[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s", which meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the Commission of the [[European Communities]] report ''Women in the European Community'' found that "it is  in  the  Netherlands (17.6%)  and  in  Ireland  (13.6%)  that  we  see  the  smallest  numbers  of  married  women  working  and  the  least  acceptance  of  this  phenomenon  by  the  general  public". (pg 14).&lt;ref&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1980s onwards, the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but most of the women [[part time job|work part time]]. In 2012, 76.9% of employed women worked part-time, well above the European Union average of 32.1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/epo_campaign/131205_country_profile_netherlands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United Kingdom===
The UK has less working mothers than many other Western countries. Lack of sufficient childcare and social stigma against working mothers have been cited as reasons.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/24/you-want-career-and-a-baby&lt;/ref&gt; In general, women in the UK have one of the highest rate of part-time work in Europe. A report by [[OECD]] which looked at the OECD members, as well as at other countries from inside and outside Europe, found that only the Netherlands and Switzerland had a higher percentage of women working part-time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the UK face one of the worst [[motherhood penalty|motherhood penalties]] among Western countries: "[mothers] find significant motherhood wage  penalties  in  several  Continental  Northern  European  countries  (Austria,  the  Netherlands  and Germany)  and  Anglophone  countries  (Canada,  the  UK and  the  US)".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---inst/documents/publication/wcms_206235.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Council]], in a recommendation to the UK (which is non-binding), has criticized the UK because "The difference in the share of part-time work between women (42,6 % in 2013) and men (13,2 % in 2013) is one of the highest in the Union. The percentage of women who are inactive or work part-time due to personal and family responsibilities (12,5 %) was almost twice as high as the EU average (6,3 %) in 2013...[e]ven if supply in the childcare system has increased recently, the availability of affordable, high-quality, full-time childcare remains a key issue."&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2015.272.01.0021.01.ENG&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
In the [[Nordic countries]], marriage and having children have far greater effects on women than on men, partly due to the expectation that women will continue unpaid domestic labor.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nordic countries have worked to make the dual-earner household the norm, with nationalized childcare, parental leave, and flexible working hours making it possible for women to continue to work.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 UNICEF report, in Sweden, although parents are given 12 months of parental leave time that can be divided between the two as each couple sees best, gender norms continue to have an effect: mandated maternity leave combined with Sweden allowing women to reduce work hours after giving birth means that nearly half of mothers in dual-income families work less than full-time.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;UNICEF. 2007. “A Call for Equality,” in The State of the World’s Children. New York: United Nations Children’s Fund. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Although women in Nordic countries have a high overall labour participation, there is a strong segregation by gender with women being often found in certain work sectors, which have a working culture adapted to family life, with flexible hours and offers of part-time jobs, and men working in other sectors. According to the Nordic Information on Gender "The gender-segregated labour market is a main reason why women are more likely to work part time in the Nordic countries than elsewhere in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/en/news/gender-segregation-in-labour-market-leads-to-part-time-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; However, this part-time work culture does not extend to Finland, where for historical reasons  there was a shortage of labour in the country, which increased the need for women to work full time - as such, the part-time culture of the other Nordic countries was never established in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/en/news/gender-segregation-in-labour-market-leads-to-part-time-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; Finland has a longer tradition of mothers working, compared to the other Nordic countries: in 1978, 73% of Finnish mothers of  0 - 6 year olds were employed, compared to 69% of Swedish and only  48% of Norwegian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/wp-content/uploads/NIKKpub_deltid1_temanord.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2014, Sweden's employment rate for women was the highest in the EU28, and was only slightly below that of men (73% female rate vs. 76.5% male rate). This compared with the EU28 rate of 58.8% female vs 69% male.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Employment_rates_for_selected_population_groups,_2004%E2%80%9314_%28%25%29_YB16.png&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Lab''' opened in June, 2016, as a multi-disciplinary technology center. Housed in Building 128 of the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], the $35 million project&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-lab-brooklyn-navy-yard-reborn-as-a-high-tech-center/|title=The Brooklyn Navy Yard's rebirth as a high-tech center|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a hardware-focused [[shared workspace]], research lab, and hatchery for socially-oriented tech manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digital.nyc/news/how-old-shipyard-became-home-hardware-startups|title=How an Old Shipyard Became a Home for Hardware Startups|date=2017-02-21|work=Digital.NYC|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the [[MIT Media Lab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/|title=News &amp; Updates – MIT Media Lab|website=MIT Media Lab|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a model, the impetus for the independent organization was to provide space and services to new manufacturing enterprises. Current members work in fields such as robotics, connected devices, energy, nanotechnology, life sciences, and urban tech.

Media coverage of New Lab has focused on the company's role in revitalizing the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.surfacemag.com/articles/brooklyn-navy-yard-waterfront-development-interview/|title=Renaissance Plan - SURFACE|date=2016-11-16|work=SURFACE|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; its public-private partnership lease structure, and Urban Tech initiative with the [[New York City Economic Development Corporation|New York CIty Economic Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nycedc.com/press-release/nycedc-launches-urban-tech-nyc-support-companies-building-smart-and-sustainable-cities|title=NYCEDC Launches Urbantech NYC to Support Companies Building Smart And Sustainable Cities|work=NYCEDC|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brooklyns-new-lab-is-an-inventors-paradise-1476714981|title=Brooklyn’s New Lab Is an Inventor’s Paradise|last=Krause|first=Elliott|date=2016-10-17|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Formation of New Lab ==
[[David Belt]] and partner Scott Cohen formed the concept for New Lab in 2011 after prospecting the decaying Building 128 with Navy Yard president David Ehrenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynnavyyard.org/navy-yard-news/ny1-online-president-of-brooklyn-navy-yard-talks-changes/|title=NY1 Online: President of Brooklyn Navy Yard Talks Changes : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|website=brooklynnavyyard.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynnavyyard.org/about-bnydc/staff/|title=Executive Staff  : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|website=brooklynnavyyard.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partners found the maritime manufacturing history of the structure, specifically the manufacturing innovations that took place there, synchronous with their aim to provide a platform for emerging hardware technologies in New York City. The city was abundant in resources and opportunities for entrepreneurs working in software, Belt said in a recent interview, but space, tools and resources for those working in the new manufacturing hardware community were lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/new-lab/|title=New Lab is a new home for hardware startups in Brooklyn’s Navy Yard|last=Ha|first=Anthony|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belt leveraged his development firm, [[Macro Sea]], a company that specializes "in bringing historic properties back into cultural relevance,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newlab.com/about/vision/|title=Vision {{!}} New Lab|date=2015-09-08|work=New Lab|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain funding, architectural expertise, and begin constructing a lease with the city of New York. The Navy Yard was in the initial stages of its current revitalization at the time and, because the city owned the property, special arrangements were needed to develop there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://commercialobserver.com/2016/09/the-plan-new-lab-at-the-brooklyn-navy-yard/|title=The Plan: New Lab at the Brooklyn Navy Yard|date=2016-09-22|work=Commercial Observer|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen began scouting the companies who would comprise their core members and helped work to capitalize them. To date, venture capitalists have invested approximately $250 million in New Lab and its members.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;

== Historical Significance of Building 128 ==
[[File:USS Arizona in New York City Crisco edit.jpg|thumb|350px|Pieces of the USS Arizona were machined in Building 128. The ship is shown heading back to the yard after sea trials.]]

=== Lineage of the Site ===
The land predating New Lab has a rich historical cultural lineage and narrative of experimental and innovative breakthroughs. That past was a major factor in the decision to develop New Lab in the Navy Yard. Before colonial settlement, the area that would become the Navy Yard served as a clamming site for the [[Lenape]] Native Americans. It was then settled by the Dutch and sold to a developer, thus beginning its employment as a center for manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thirteen.org|title=The City Concealed: Brooklyn Navy Yard|date=2009-01-25|url=https://vimeo.com/2950807|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the technological advancements that took place at the Navy Yard are: the first use of the steam-powered pile driver; construction of the first undersea telegraph cable; development of a commercialized form of anesthetic ether by E.R.

Construction of navy ships like the Fulton II, a first-of-its-kind steam-powered warship, and fabrication of the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS Arizona]], state-of-the-art among its peers, induced many influential manufacturing process refinements and advancements.

In interviews, Belt and Cohen both cite this maritime and technological history as inspiration for New Lab, both in guiding the renovation of the facility and in shaping its mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/ruki-founder-s-journal/newlab-cab35fee1172|title=Scott Cohen (New Lab) on why he is building a hardware hub in NYC|last=РУКИ|date=2017-03-17|website=Medium|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building 128 ===
According to a [[The Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation|Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation]] document,128 was raised in 1899 as a "steel structure... used to assemble large boiler engines and fabricated sections of naval vessels." It served as the primary machine shop for every major ship launched during World Wars One and Two. Designed to accommodate the significant height of a warship, the sequence of its hulking steel girders resembles an airport hangar. 128 has been slated for, but avoided, plans for non-naval readaptation. The City of New York sought to adapt it for reuse as a "food complex at one point," but the effort was not sustained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kensinger.blogspot.com/2007/12/brooklyn-navy-yard-building-128.html|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard: Building 128|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renovation and Architecture ===
[[File:New Lab Building128 Renovation.jpg|thumb|350px|left|August 31, 2015 photo of Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 128 in the later stages of renovation for New Lab]]
Marvel Architects, New Lab's architect of record, along with DBI, Belt's project management firm, worked together to craft and execute the renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://marvelarchitects.com/project/brooklyn-navy-yard-new-lab/|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard {{!}} New Lab {{!}} Marvel Architects|work=Marvel Architects|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press regarding New Lab often states that the company occupies Building 128 of the Navy Yard, but this is slightly misleading in that 128 is a complex of warehouses and New Lab occupies the southernmost portion.

Recladding the building's armature and repurposing of the 51,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; machine shop into an 84,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; multidisciplinary design, prototyping, and advanced manufacturing space took approximately 5 years and continued until the company's full opening in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2016/06/new-lab-opens-brooklyn-navy-yard/|title=New Lab opens in Brooklyn Navy Yard - Archpaper.com|website=archpaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undertaking utilized approximately 9,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of steel in total according to the developer.&lt;ref name="Space {{!}} New Lab"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newlab.com/about/space/|title=Space {{!}} New Lab|date=2015-09-08|work=New Lab|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A guiding principle of the redesign was to harmonize of the needs of the forthcoming lab environment with the original structural features. Modern workplace design elements were fused with the 19th century industrial characteristics of the building's centerline.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://marvelarchitects.com/project/brooklyn-navy-yard-new-lab/|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard {{!}} New Lab {{!}} Marvel Architects|work=Marvel Architects|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Floor Plan ===
New Lab's open floor design was intended, spatially, to reinforce its mission, the layout meant to encourage member companies to collaborate and cross-pollinate ideas. Communal meeting rooms, office pods, and interior plazas on both floors emphasize the developer’s intention to create a collaborative design and fabrication center.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Upon completion, the rebuild subdivided Building 128's usable space into: Private studios = 31,664&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Open private studios = 6,226&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Fabrication lab = 6,834&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Cafe kitchen = 600&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Conference rooms = 2,014&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Coworking desks = 144; Flex space = 66 desks.&lt;ref name="Space {{!}} New Lab"/&gt;

There is an additional 6,174&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of event space which hosts talks, hackathons, and new manufacturing events such as the recent Urban Tech Hub launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/urban-tech-hub-launch-tickets-33215215604|title=Urban Tech Hub Launch|website=Eventbrite|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prototyping and Fabrication Lab ==
Additive Manufacturing (3D printing) technology is a component of the design process for many New Lab residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/design/the-daily/brooklyns-industrial-revolution|title=Brooklyn’s industrial revolution|date=2016-12-09|work=1843|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping shops are a distinguishing feature of the hardware-centric facility. New Lab leverages partnerships with firms like AutoDesk, Stratasys, BigRep, Haas, Ultimaker, and others to provide and maintain equipment and filament for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=auto+desk+newlab+brooklyb&amp;oq=auto+desk+newlab+brooklyb&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.8445j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=auto desk newlab brooklyb - Google Search|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/224785/3d-printers-co-working-space/|title=3D Printers Open New Opportunities for Co-Working Space {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has amassed several million dollars of digital fabrication and manufacturing machine assets such as 3D Printers, electronic workbenches, fabrication tools, and CNC equipment since its opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/new-lab/|title=New Lab is a new home for hardware startups in Brooklyn’s Navy Yard|last=Ha|first=Anthony|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''open house''' (also known as '''open day''' and '''at-home day''') is an event held at an institution where its doors are open to the general public to allow people to look around the institution and learn about it. These are often held at [[schools]] and [[universities]] to attract prospective students, familiarize them (and their parents) with the facilities, allow new students to become familiar with facilities and meet others, or to open informal communication channels between school staff and the students and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open day|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/open-day|website=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition.|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open houses in American schools==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
School open houses are about two hours long, the length of a good movie or show . . . a well-executed event sets the stage for a successful [[school year]]. The face-to-face meetings with families help build relationships, increase the visibility of the parent group, and develop a [[sense of community]] at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contrary to what its name might seem to imply, an open house at the average school is not intended for general members of the public, but rather, specifically, for the parents and family members of the students who either attend or are considering attending a school. In the overwhelming majority of [[Education in the United States|schools in the United States]], open house is held once a year, typically in the first month or first quarter of the [[school year]]. It is common for open houses to be held in the evenings or weekends, to allow for parents who work during the standard the [[work-week]] hours to attend, but holding open house in the daytime is not unusual, especially at elementary schools.

===Elementary schools===
In [[elementary schools]], open houses often have no schedule; parents come and go during the scheduled hours as they please, and some teachers may be willing to discuss individual students' progress with their parents. Some schools may schedule displays of [[school activities]], such as a performance by a [[Children's Choir|student choir]].

===Secondary schools===
In [[secondary schools]]—divided into [[middle schools]] (also called junior high schools) and [[high schools]] (also called senior high schools)—the single most important purpose of the open house is to allow parents and teachers meet each other face-to-face. In many middle schools and high schools, parents are given a schedule, often the same schedule their child follows during the school day. The parents go from one class to another, in the sequence that their child attends them, usually in the very same classrooms. Typically in such open houses the parents have only 5–15 minutes with their child's teacher, which provides time for the teacher to explain their class expectations, but not enough time to discuss individual children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12083">'''Participatory media''' is media where the audience can play an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing and disseminating content.&lt;ref name="wemedia"&gt;Bowman, S., Willis, C. "[http://www.hypergene.net/wemedia/weblog.php We Media: How Audiences are Shaping the Future of News and Information.]" 2003: The Media Center at the American Press Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citizen journalism|Citizen / Participatory journalism]], [[citizen media]] and [[democratic media]] are related principles.

Participatory media includes [[community media]], [[blogs]], [[wiki]]s, [[RSS (file format)|RSS]], [[tag (metadata)|tagging]] and [[social bookmarking]], music-photo-video sharing, [[Mashup (music)|mashups]], [[podcast]]s, [[participatory video]] projects and [[videoblogs]]. All together they can be described as "e-services, which involve end-users as active participants in the value creation process".&lt;ref&gt;http://eipcm.org/research.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, "active [...] uses of media are not exclusive to our times".&lt;ref name="history_pm"&gt;Ekström, A., Jülich, S., Lundgren, F., Wisselgren, P. "History of Participatory Media". 2011: Taylor &amp; Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the history of mediated communication we can find many variations of participatory practices. For instance, the initial phase of the [[radio]] knew many examples of non-professional broadcasters".&lt;ref name="Carpentier"&gt;Carpentier, Nico. "Participation Is Not Enough: The Conditions of Possibility of Mediated Participatory Practices" 2009: European Journal of Communication 2009 24: 407-419.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall MacLuhan]] discussed the participatory potential of media already in the 1970s but in the era of digital and [[social media]], the theory of [[participatory culture]] becomes even more acute as the borders between audiences and media producers are blurring.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, Henry. "Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide" 2006: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
These distinctly different media share three common, interrelated characteristics:&lt;ref name="Rheingold"&gt;{{cite web|last= Rheingold |first= Howard|title=Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement|publisher=Thesis, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|location=2007|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/dmal.9780262524827.097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Many-to-many]] [[Media (communication)|media]] now make it possible for every person connected to the network to broadcast and receive [[Written language|text]], [[image]]s, [[sound|audio]], [[video]], [[software]], [[data]], [[discussion]]s, [[Transaction processing|transactions]], [[computation]]s, [[tag (metadata)|tags]], or [[hyperlink|links]] to and from every other person. The asymmetry between broadcaster and audience that was dictated by the structure of pre-digital technologies dictated has changed radically. This is a technical-structural characteristic.
* Participatory media are [[social media]] whose value and power derives from the active participation of [[Internet meme|many people]]. This is a psychological and social characteristic. One example is [[StumbleUpon]].
* [[Social network]]s, when amplified by information and [[communication networks]], enable broader, faster, and lower cost coordination of activities. This is an economic and political characteristic.

Full-fledged participatory news sites include [[NowPublic]], [[OhmyNews]], DigitalJournal.com, [[On the Ground News Reports]] and [[GroundReport]].

With participatory media, the boundaries between audiences and creators become blurred and often invisible. In the words of [[David Sifry]], the founder of [[Technorati]], a search engine for blogs, one-to-many "lectures" (i.e., from media companies to their audiences) are transformed into "conversations" among "the people formerly known as the audience". This changes the tone of public discussions. The mainstream media, says [[David Weinberger]], a blogger, author and fellow at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], "don't get how subversive it is to take institutions and turn them into conversations". That is because institutions are closed, assume a hierarchy and have trouble admitting fallibility, he says, whereas conversations are open-ended, assume equality and eagerly concede fallibility.&lt;ref name="Kluth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kluth|first=Andreas|title=Among the Audience|publisher=[[Economist]]|location=2006|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794156|date=20 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proposed that journalism can be more "[[participatory]]" because the [[World Wide Web]] has evolved from "read-only" to "[[read/write culture|read-write]]". In other words, in the past only a small proportion of people had the means (in terms of time, money, and skills) to create content that could reach large audiences. Now the gap between the resources and skills needed to consume online content versus the means necessary to produce it have narrowed significantly to the point that nearly anyone with a web-connected device can create media.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon"&gt;{{cite web|last=MacKinnon|first=Rebecca|title=Blogging, Journalism and Credibility: The Future of Global Participatory Media|publisher=Seikai Shisosya|location=2007|url=http://rconversation.blogs.com/MacKinnon_blogging_and_journalism_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Dan Gillmor]], founder of the Center for Citizen Media declared in his 2004 book [[We the Media]], journalism is evolving from a lecture into a conversation.&lt;ref name="Gilmor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmor|first=Dan|title=We the Media|publisher=[[O’Reilly]]|location=2004|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that new interactive forms of media have blurred the distinction between producers of news and their audience. In fact, some view the term "audience" to be obsolete in the new world of interactive participatory media. New York University professor and blogger [[Jay Rosen]] refers to them as "the people formerly known as the audience."&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=Top Ten Ideas of '04: News Turns from a Lecture to a Conversation|publisher=Pressthink|location=2006|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906032526/http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html|archivedate=2010-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "We Media", a treatise on participatory journalism, Shayne Bowman and Chris Willis suggest that the "audience" should be renamed "participants".&lt;ref name="wemedia"/&gt; One of the first projects encompassing participatory media prior to the advent of social media was The [[September 11 Photo Project]]. The exhibit was a not-for-profit community based photo project in response to the [[September 11 attacks]] and their aftermath. It provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The Project aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historical preservation.

Some even proposed that "all mass media should be abandoned", extending upon one of the four main arguments given by [[Jerry Mander]] in his case against television: Corporate domination of television used to mould humans for a commercial environment, and all mass media involve centralized power. Blogger Robin Good wrote, "With participatory media instead of mass media, governments and corporations would be far less able to control information and maintain their legitimacy... To bring about true participatory media (and society), it is also necessary to bring about participatory alternatives to present economic and political structures... In order for withdrawal from using the mass media to become more popular, participatory media must become more attractive: cheaper, more accessible, more fun, more relevant. In such an atmosphere, nonviolent action campaigns against the mass media and in support of participatory media become more feasible."&lt;ref name="Good"&gt;{{cite web|last=Good |first=Robin|title=The Power Of Open Participatory Media And Why Mass Media Must Be Abandoned|publisher=blog|location=2003|url=http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2006/03/20/the_power_of_open_participatory.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although 'participatory media' has been viewed uncritically by many writers, others, such as [[Daniel Palmer (writer)|Daniel Palmer]], have argued that media participation must also "be understood in relation to defining characteristics of contemporary capitalism – namely its user-focused, customised and individuated orientation."&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=Daniel|title=Participatory Media: Visual Culture in Real Time|publisher=University of Melbourne|location=2004|url=http://dtl.unimelb.edu.au/R/V3S399QAFCVRQXAL239Q87YCD42LF7U2C51Q6FQB3XGDCXA3YR-01304?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=65808&amp;local_base=GEN01&amp;pds_handle=GUEST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
* The phrase '''Participatory Media''' was first used publicly by [http://deoxy.org/seize_it.htm Greg Ruggiero] and later popularized by blog researcher [http://www.rebeccablood.net/talks/waging_peace.html#content Rebecca Blood] and others, such as [[Furukawa Group|Furukawa]]. In April 2006, journalist and media researcher [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611092957/http://getmydrift.typepad.com/pfel/2006/04/my_blogging_and.html Jim McClellan] used the phrase '''Personal Participatory Media''', which may distinguish between objective social media (scientific, corporate, pure information) and subjective/personal social media (value-laden, opinion, religious).

The combination of '''politics and technology''' covers concepts, mechanisms, personalities, efforts, and [[social movement]]s including but not necessarily limited to the [[Internet]] and other [[Information technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs).

A growing body of scholarship has begun to explore how Internet technologies are influencing [[political communication]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participation]], especially in terms of what is known as the [[public sphere]].

One of the most influential and transformational information and communication technologies is the [[mobile phone]] or [[smartphone]], which can include: talk, text messaging, [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web|Web]] access, [[electronic mail]], [[faxing]], pictures, video, and a wide variety of [[Mobile app|apps]]. Mobile devices are proving to increase political participation and are now even being portrayed as a voting gadget in even the [[least developed countries]]. Increased availability of this [[technology]] and subsequent access to the public sphere has enhanced the ability of individuals and groups to bring attention to and organize around specialized issues.&lt;ref&gt;Creeber, Glen. Digital Cultures: [understanding New Media]. Maidenhead: Open Univ., 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[social media]] has emerged to become one of the main areas of influence for [[politics]], where millions of users are able to learn about politicians' policies and statements, interact with political leaders, organize, and voice their own opinions on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Politics and the Twitter revolution : how tweets influence the relationship between political leaders and the public|last2=Bichard|first2=Shannon|date=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739165010|location=Lanham, MD|page=1|pages=|last1=Parmelee|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The digital public sphere ==
The idea of the [[public sphere]] has generally come to be understood as the open social spaces and [[public space]]s in which private citizens interact and share information and ideas relevant to the society. These can include, for example, town halls, public squares, markets, coffee shops, or what ancient Greeks called [[agora]]s. Many scholars have argued that these spaces are vitally important for creating and maintaining an active and informed public in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24669015|title=Free spaces : the sources of democratic change in America|last=Evans|first=Sara M.|last2=Boyte|first2=Harry C.|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=|isbn=978-0226222578|edition= 2nd|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=24669015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jürgen Habermas]]' book  ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere|The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere – An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society]]'', he defines the public sphere as "a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18327374|title=The structural transformation of the public sphere : an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society|last=Jürgen|first=Habermas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=978-0262081801|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18327374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the public sphere should be open to all citizens, and free from influence from governments or private businesses. Habermas goes on to argue that:&lt;blockquote href="Digital rights"&gt;"A portion of the public sphere is constituted in every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public. They are then acting neither as business or professional people conducting their private affairs, nor as legal consociates subject to the legal regulations of a state bureaucracy and obligated to obedience. Citizens act as a public when they deal with matters of general interest without being subject to coercion; thus with the guarantee that they may assemble and unite freely, and express and publicize their opinions freely."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Howard Rheingold]] argues that, "There is an intimate connection between informal conversations, the kind that take place in communities... and the ability of large social groups to govern themselves without monarchs or dictators.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44162557|title=The virtual community : homesteading on the electronic frontier|last=Howard.|first=Rheingold,|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262681216|edition= Rev. |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=44162557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheingold and others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlgren|first=Peter|date=2006|title=The Internet, Public Spheres, and Political Communication: Dispersion and Deliberation|journal=Political Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=147–162|doi=10.1080/10584600590933160}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also gone on to argue that virtual spaces created through the [[Internet]] and related [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] have led to the emergence of a new type of digital public sphere. Some scholars have conceptualized this alternately as a virtual public sphere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papacharissi|first=Zizi|date=2002|title=The virtual sphere|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=9–27|doi=10.1177/14614440222226244|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a networked public sphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirky|first=Clay|date=2011|title=The Political Power of Social Media: Technology, the Public Sphere, and Political Change|jstor=25800379|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=90|issue=1|pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961312425|title=Twitter and tear gas : the power and fragility of networked protest|last=Zeynep|first=Tufekci|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9780300215120|location=New Haven|pages=|oclc=961312425}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still others have similarly described what they call a networked society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855022865|title=Communication power|last=Castells|first=Manuel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780191510434|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=855022865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795757037|title=Networks of outrage and hope: social movements in the Internet age|last=Castells|first=Manuel|date=|publisher=Polity|year=2015|isbn=9780745662855|edition= 2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=795757037}}&lt;/ref&gt; or networked publics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/283798198|title=Networked Publics|last=Varnelis|first=Kazys|date=|publisher=MIT Press|others=Annenberg Center for Communication (University of Southern California)|year=2008|isbn=9780262285483|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=283798198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, these new virtual spaces can be used in much the same way as traditional, offline spaces; that is, as a "free space"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48943689|title=Democratic phoenix : reinventing political activism|last=Pippa|first=Norris|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-0521811774|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=|oclc=48943689}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss and debate ideas of public importance. Just as the public sphere is a combination of "every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the digital public sphere also comprises all forms of [[new media]], such as [[chat room]]s, website comment sections, and [[social media]], in which private citizens engage in discourse as a public. Virtual spaces may overlap or interact with offline spaces as well, forming what has been called "hybrid networks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Merlyna|date=2015|title=A CyberUrban Space Odyssey: The Spatiality of Contemporary Social Movements|url=https://www.academia.edu/16240525|journal=New Geographies|language=en|volume=7|pages=117–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars argue that social media affords increasing opportunities for political discourse and mobilization within the digital public sphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loader|first=Brian D.|last2=Mercea|first2=Dan|date=2011|title=Networking Democracy?

=== Criticisms ===

==== Social exclusion ====
The traditional, offline public sphere has been criticized for not being as inclusive in practice as it is in theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23650367|title=Habermas and the public sphere|last=|first=|publisher=MIT Press|others=|year=1992|isbn=978-0262031837|editor-last=Calhoun|editor-first=Craig J.|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=23650367}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Feminist scholars like [[Nancy Fraser]] have argued that the public sphere has historically not been as open or accessible to [[Social exclusion|disadvantaged or marginalized groups]] in a society, such as women or people of color; therefore, such groups are forced to form their own separate public spheres, which she refers to as a [[Counterpublic|counter-public]] or ''subaltern counter public''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Nancy|date=1990|title=Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy|jstor=466240|journal=Social Text|issue=25/26|pages=56–80|doi=10.2307/466240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars contend that online spaces are more open and thus may help to increase inclusive political participation from marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlosberg|first=David|last2=Dryzek|first2=John S.|date=2002|title=Digital Democracy: Authentic or Virtual?|jstor=26162195|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|volume=15|issue=3|pages=332–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Anonymity|anonymous]] online spaces should allow all individuals to speak with an equal voice to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deseriis|first=M.|date=2013|title=Is Anonymous a New Form of Luddism?: A Comparative Analysis of Industrial Machine Breaking, Computer Hacking, and Related Rhetorical Strategies|journal=Radical History Review|language=en|volume=2013|issue=117|pages=33–48|doi=10.1215/01636545-2210437|issn=0163-6545}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other have pointed out that many contemporary online spaces are not anonymous, such as [[Facebook]]. Avatars and social media profiles often portray an individual's offline identity, which can lead to practices of online discrimination and exclusion which mirror offline inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/214085023|title=Digitizing race : visual cultures of the Internet|last=Lisa|first=Nakamura|date=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=|isbn=9780816653775|location=Minneapolis|pages=|oclc=214085023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, more and more historically disadvantaged or marginalized groups are also using Internet technology to carve out new online spaces for their own "networked counterpublics" such as through the use of [[hashtag]]s like #Ferguson and [[Black Lives Matter|#BlackLivesMatter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Sarah J.|last2=Foucault Welles|first2=Brooke|date=2015|title=Hijacking #myNYPD: Social Media Dissent and Networked Counterpublics|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=65|issue=6|pages=932–952|doi=10.1111/jcom.12185|issn=0021-9916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Sarah J.|last2=Foucault Welles|first2=Brooke|date=2016|title=#Ferguson is everywhere: initiators in emerging counterpublic networks|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–418|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1106571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The digital divide ====
Another factor which affects access to the digital public sphere is the [[digital divide]], which refers to how people from [[Least Developed Countries|less developed countries]] tend to have less access to [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] compared to those from more [[Developed country|developed countries]]. For example, the most developed regions of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, have the highest [[Global Internet usage|Internet penetration rates]] at over 80% each, while the least developed countries such as in Africa and South Asia have less than 30% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269329/penetration-rate-of-the-internet-by-region/|title=Global regional internet penetration rate 2017 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the reduced cost and increasing availability of mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s throughout less developed regions is helping to reduce this disparity at an exponential rate. In just two years, between 2013 and 2015, the number of Internet users in developing nations has risen by 9%, according to the [[Pew Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/02/22/smartphone-ownership-and-internet-usage-continues-to-climb-in-emerging-economies/|title=Smartphone Ownership and Internet Usage Continues to Climb in Emerging Economies|date=2016-02-22|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has shown, though, that even within more developed countries like the United States, the digital divide continues to persist between upper and lower socioeconomic classes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/broadband-adoption-rates-and-gaps-in-u-s-metropolitan-areas/|title=Broadband adoption rates and gaps in U.S. metropolitan areas|last=Tomer|first=Adie|date=2015|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-07-01|last2=Kane|first2=Jospeh|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between different education levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/05/some-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/|title=11% of Americans don’t use the internet. Who are they?|date=2018-03-05|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, scholars like [[Mark Warschauer]] argue that it is not just access to technology that matters, but the knowledge of how to put that technology to use in meaningful ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50028800|title=Technology and social inclusion : rethinking the digital divide|last=Mark.|first=Warschauer,|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262232241|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=50028800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Program on Negotiation''' ('''PON''') is a university [[consortium]] dedicated to developing the theory and practice of [[negotiation]] and [[dispute resolution]]. As a community of scholars and practitioners, PON serves a unique role in the world negotiation community. Founded in 1983 as a special research project at [[Harvard Law School]], PON includes faculty, students, and staff from [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Tufts University]].

The Program on Negotiation publishes the quarterly ''Negotiation Journal'' and the monthly ''Negotiation Briefings'' newsletter, and distributes the annual ''Harvard Negotiation Law Review''. Throughout the year PON offers a number of courses and training opportunities ranging in length from one day to an entire semester.

== History ==

In 1979, co-authors of the bestseller ''[[Getting to Yes|Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In]]'', [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury]], along with Bruce Patton founded the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]] (HNP), with a mission to improve the theory, teaching, and practice of negotiation and dispute resolution, so that people could deal more constructively with conflicts ranging from the interpersonal to the international. Fisher began by asking the question of what kind of advice could be given to both sides of a dispute, and in researching this question he came in contact with various professors, including James Sebenius, [[Lawrence Susskind]], [[Frank Sander]], and [[Howard Raiffa]], who collaborated to form the Program on Negotiation.

The Program on Negotiation was founded in 1983 as the world's first teaching and research center dedicated to negotiation and dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/about/|title=Welcome to the Program on Negotiation (PON)|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[umbrella organization]] with founding members from both Harvard and MIT, it soon expanded to include Tufts University as one of its consortium schools. Since the beginning, the Program on Negotiation has been multi-disciplinary, with scholars from economics, government, law, business, psychology, anthropology, education, and the arts. Faculty have focused on a wide range of research topics, including deal-making, diplomatic negotiations, international negotiations, psychological aspects of negotiations, decision-making, issues relating to ethics and trust, and labor negotiations.

Chair of the Program on Negotiation since 1994, Professor Robert H. Mnookin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/faculty/robert-mnookin-chair-pon-executive-committee/|title=Robert Mnookin, Chair, PON Executive Committee|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Samuel Williston Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Among his recent publications are the books, ''Beyond Winning: Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/beyond-winning-negotiating-to-create-value-in-deals-and-disputes/|title=Beyond Winning Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/bargaining-with-the-devil-when-to-negotiate-when-to-fight/|title=Bargaining with the Devil When to Negotiate, When to Fight|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

The Program on Negotiation is responsible for multiple publications, including books, special reports, the ''Negotiation Briefings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/category/publication/negotiation-briefings/|title=Negotiation Briefings Monthly Archives Archives - PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; newsletter and the quarterly ''Negotiation Journal'', a multidisciplinary international journal published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]] detailing the latest advances in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/publications/negotiation-journal/|title=Negotiation Journal|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; PON also regularly produces free reports that are available through their website, such as: "Teaching Negotiation: Understanding The Impact Of Role-Play Simulations",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/freemium/new-teaching-negotiation-understanding-the-impact-of-role-play-simulations/|title=NEW!

== Training ==

PON offers a number of training programs throughout the year on a variety of topics including negotiation, mediation, conflict resolution, deal design, difficult conversations, and many more. PON seminars and courses are open to the public.

=== Author Sessions ===
The Program on Negotiation offers one day Author Sessions focused on recent book publications by PON faculty members as part of its Executive Education Series. Recent courses included: Deal-Making and Negotiauctions, Creating a World-class Negotiating Organization, Bargaining with the Devil, and Negotiating International Deals.

=== Executive Education ===
Executive Education courses last for three days, covering strategies for business leaders to handle both successful day-to-day management and long-term strategies for healthy workplace environments. Executives learn tactics for dealing with dirty tricks, threats, attacks, and stonewalls from the other side of the table.

=== Harvard Negotiation Institute ===
Harvard Negotiation Institute (HNI) classes are offered every June and September on the Harvard Law School campus and cover a broad range of negotiation and mediation skills, ranging from beginning to advanced techniques. Most of the courses offered are five-day classes. However, a 2-day Intensive Negotiation Workshop for Lawyers and Working Professionals is also offered. Recent course offerings included: a mediation workshop, Creating Value in Deals and Disputes, Tools for Preparing and Negotiating Effectively, Deal Design and Implementation, and Difficult Conversations.

=== PON Seminars ===
Open to participants from all disciplines and professional fields, the PON [[Seminars]] provide negotiation and [[mediation]] courses to the community. These semester-length courses are designed to increase public awareness and understanding of successful conflict resolution efforts.

Two courses are taught each year: Negotiation and Dispute Resolution in the fall, and Mediation and Conflict Management in the spring. Both courses provide participants with a conceptual framework and practical advice for professional and personal development in dispute resolution. Faculty is drawn from the PON community of scholars and practitioners of alternative dispute resolution.

The Program on Negotiation also hosts a variety of smaller workshops and intensive two-day courses in addition to their normal course offerings, including on-site training.

== Great Negotiator Award ==

The Program on Negotiation established the [[Great Negotiator Award]] in 2000 to honor individuals of extraordinary achievement in dispute resolution. The award is designed not only to honor the accomplishments of outstanding negotiators, but also to focus public attention on the important role of negotiation as society faces increasingly complex disputes in all sectors–public and private, technological and ethical, personal and professional. PON has recognized a diverse cast of distinguished negotiators from their respective fields: [[Juan Manuel Santos]], [[2016 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and President of [[Colombia]] (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/09/santos-receives-2017-great-negotiator-award/ |title= Santos receives 2017 Great Negotiator Award |publisher= news.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Martti Ahtisaari]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and former President of [[Finland]] (2010); [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]], the artists who created [[The Gates]] in [[Central Park]] (2008); [[Bruce Wasserstein]], Chairman and CEO of [[Lazard]], an international financial advisory and asset management firm (2007); [[Sadako Ogata]], former [[United Nations]] high commissioner for refugees (2005); [[Richard Holbrooke]], former United States ambassador to the United Nations (2004); [[Stuart Eizenstat]], former U.S. ambassador to the [[European Union]] (2003); Ambassador [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], the United Nations’ special envoy for [[Afghanistan]] (2002); [[Charlene Barshefsky]], U.S. trade representative in the second [[Clinton administration]] (2001); and former U.S. Senator [[George J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">The job of the '''public editor''' is to supervise the implementation of proper [[journalism ethics]] at a newspaper, and to identify and examine critical errors or omissions, and to act as a liaison to the public. They do this primarily through a regular feature on a newspaper's [[editorial]] page. Because public editors are generally employees of the very newspaper they're criticizing, it may appear as though there is a possibility for bias. However, a newspaper with a high standard of ethics would not fire a public editor for a criticism of the paper; the act would contradict the purpose of the position and would itself be a very likely cause for public concern.

Many major newspapers in the U.S. use the public editor column as the voice for their [[Ombudsman#News ombudsman|ombudsman]], though this is not always so. Public editor columns cover a broader scope of issues and do not have an accreditation process, while in order to qualify as an ombudsman of any standing one must be a member of the [[Organisation of News Ombudsmen]].

The first newspaper to appoint an ombudsman was Tokyo's ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' in 1922; the first American newspapers to appoint a public editor were the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' and ''[[Louisville Times]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Ananny, "It’s time to reimagine the role of a public editor, starting at The New York Times," Nieman Lab, March 17, 2016, Neiman Foundation at Harvard, URL=http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/mike-ananny-its-time-to-reimagine-the-role-of-a-public-editor-starting-at-the-new-york-times/&lt;/ref&gt;

At ''[[The New York Times]]'', the position was created in response to the [[Jayson Blair#Plagiarism and fabrication scandal|Jayson Blair scandal]]. The ''Times''' first public editor was [[Daniel Okrent]], who held the position from December 2003 through May 2005.  Okrent's successor was [[Byron Calame]], who was followed by [[Clark Hoyt]], who held the position for three years. In August 2010, [[Arthur S. Brisbane]] assumed the post and held it until 2012, when [[Margaret M. Sullivan]] took the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/times-names-buffalo-news-editor-as-its-new-public-editor/|title=Times Names Buffalo News Editor as Its New Public Editor|last=Vega|first=Tanzina|date=16 July 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April, 2016, Sullivan left the position to become a media columnist at the ''[[Washington Post]]''; her last column for the ''Times'' was dated April 16.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sullivan, "Public Editor No. 5 Is Yesterday’s News," The New York Times, April 16, 2016, URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/public-editor/margaret-sullivan-new-york-times-public-editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;  She was replaced by [[Elizabeth Spayd]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Ember, "New York Times Names Elizabeth Spayd Its 6th Public Editor", The New York Times, May 18, 2016, URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/media/new-york-times-names-elizabeth-spayd-its-6th-public-editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 31, 2017, the ''Times'' announced that it was eliminating the public editor position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/business/media/new-york-times-buyouts.html |title=New York Times Will Offer Employee Buyouts and Eliminate Public Editor Role |work=The New York Times |date= |accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining religion and religious elements==

[[Religion]] has several definitions. [[Organized religion|Religions]] that are [[Religious organization|organized]] can be seen as [[cultural system]]s, with corresponding [[religious behaviour|behavior]] and practice. They often have [[sacred text]]s and [[holy places]]. A [[religious experience]], however, does not necessarily have to be understood through an established religious framework.

Themes and questions about life and death, innocence and guilt and violence are [[Existentialism|existential]] in nature; while they are not immediately understood as "religious", they are about the [[meaning of life]].

==Use of religious elements==

[[Video game developer]]s use religious and spiritual themes to involve the player more deeply in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Testa |first=Alessandro |date= |title= Religion(s) in Videogames Historical and Anthropological Observations |url=http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/religions/issue/view/1449/showToc |journal= Online - Heidelberg Journal of Religions on the Internet |publisher= |volume= 05 |issue= Religion in Digital Games.

The negative portrayal of religions has been criticized.&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/&gt;

Religious elements are used in two ways: explicit and implicit. They are seen side-by-side in video games and do not exclude each other.&lt;ref name="Understanding"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Terry Ray |last2= Clanton | first2 = Dan W. |date= 2012 |title= Understanding Religion and Popular Culture: Theories, Themes, Products and Practices|publisher= [[Routledge]]|page= 130 |isbn= 9780415781060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion in ''Mass Effect'', for instance, can be understood as an "[[unseen character]]".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Irizarry, J.A. &amp; Irizarry, I.T. The Lord is My Shepard: Confronting Religion in the Mass Effect Trilogy. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explicit narrative references===
An explicit reference to a religious or spiritual concept is one that is clear to what it is referring.&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt; These can be based upon real-world religions, but also on fictional ones. Stories, [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] and names of characters from [[religious text]]s are used as reference points.

====Ancient religions====
{{see also|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture}}
Ancient religions and their deities are used in various ways. The religions portrayed are often no longer practiced, like [[ancient Greek religion]].&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/&gt; In the real-time strategy game ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' the player has to choose a "major god", which gives certain gameplay benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-09-age-of-mythology-extended-edition-review |title=Age of Mythology: Extended Edition review |date=9 May 2014 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' the nameless Prince has to fight [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]], an evil deity from [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Crecente, B. |year=2008 |title=Prince of Persia Ditches Roots, Gets a Final Fantasy Make-Over, |accessdate=18 September 2015|url= http://kotaku.com/5011425/prince-of-persia-ditches-roots-gets-a-final-fantasy-make-over}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Events and places====
Real world historical religions and events are used as inspiration for video games. For instance, while ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2007) is [[historical fiction|fictional]], it is set during the [[Third Crusade]] in the [[Holy Land]]; the player takes on the role of the [[Assassins|Assassin]] [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] and is involved in the conflict between Catholic Christians, Orthodox Christians, Sunni Muslims and Shi'ite Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=LeJacq, Y. |year=2014 |title=Assassin's Creed Can Actually Teach You A Thing Or Two |url= http://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-can-actually-teach-you-a-thing-or-two-1576446550 |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these religions appear, they are portrayed in a "sanitized manner".&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5509058/religion-in-games-less-a-leap-of-faith-more-a-suspension-of-belief |title= Religion in Games: Less a Leap of Faith, More a Suspension of Belief |last= Good |first= Owen |date= 2010-04-04 |website= [[Kotaku]] |publisher= |access-date= 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organizations====
Religion is often institutionalized, having a certain organisational structure. Most games in the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series involve a religion, or a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5883361/the-rules-of-religion-and-why-the-next-one-just-might-be-a-game |title=The Rules of Religion, and Why The Next One Just Might Be a Game |first=Patricia |last=Hernandez |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious violence====
In the action role-playing game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' (2011) a civil war is about to erupt between the Empire and the Stormcloaks.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Thames, R. C. Religion as a Resource in Digital Games. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The Stormcloaks wish to worship Talos, a human ascended to godhood. The Empire suffered a defeat against the powerful Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance of Elves who have made the worship of Talos illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/what-happened-between-oblivion-skyrim-a-brief-history/2/ |title=What happened between Oblivion and Skyrim? Here's a brief history |first=Matt |last=Boyd |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is up to the player to help in the conflict.

===Implicit narrative references===
[[Image:Triforce.svg|thumb|right|175px|The [[Triforce]] from [[The Legend of Zelda|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]]. Based upon the concept of [[Mon (badge)|''mon'']], it is a recognizable symbol for the series]]
The stories of [[action-adventure]] and [[Role-playing video games|role-playing]] games often involve world-saving quests. The player, as the protagonist, takes on the role of the hero.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane McGonigal|McGonigal, J]] (2011). ''Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better''. Maven Publishing, Amsterdam. Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The player character is often destined to save the world, which in itself is a [[prophecy]].&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/video-game-religions-or-lack-thereof |title=Video Game Religions (or Lack Thereof) |first=Gil |last=Almogi |accessdate=2016-04-21 |date=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, A.

Immersion into the Field''. Volume 07 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' uses religious elements and motifs like the [[Triforce]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games as a religious medium==

Players and developers use games to express their existential and spiritual feelings. Video games as cultural objects can also provide religious and spiritual experiences, like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/community/2013/01/22/can-we-finally-begin-to-consider-video-games-experiences/|title=It's time we consider video games as ‘experiences,’ not mere products|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Jenova Chen]] said that "I feel that ''Journey'' is a very spiritual game. People from around the world ask me if the game has a religious connection. Many religions share an affinity with ''Journey''—this is because many religions partly share a common structure". Chen said ''Journey'' is based upon [[Joseph Campbell]]'s book on comparative mythology ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' and the [[Monomyth|"Hero's Journey"]] narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/religion-friendship-and-emotion-a-journey-post-mortem/1100-6367138/|title=Religion, friendship, and emotion: A Journey post-mortem|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/180290-journey-as-ritual/|title='Journey' As Ritual|work=[[PopMatters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Leonard Nimoy]], ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' added two statues in his honor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/06/leonard-nimoy-memorials-added-to-star-trek-online?%20|title=Leonard Nimoy Memorials Added to Star Trek Online|first=Luke|last=Karmali|date=6 March 2015|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' added a [[non-player character]] (NPC) based upon [[Robin Williams]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/robin-williams-to-be-memorialized-in-wow|title=Robin Williams to Be Memorialized in WoW|first=David|last=Witmer|date=12 August 2014|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/apparent-robin-williams-model-found-in-world-of-warcraft/|title=Apparent Robin Williams Models Found In World Of Warcraft|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Gearbox Software]] honored a late fan of ''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]'', cancer victim Michael John Mamaril, by adding a NPC named after him in [[Borderlands 2|the sequel]]. Additionally, Gearbox posted a eulogy to Mamaril in the voice of the game character Claptrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/gearbox-to-honor-late-fan-as-an-npc-in-borderlands-2-215160.phtml|title=Gearbox to honor late fan as an NPC in Borderlands 2|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|first=Tony|last=Ponce|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their game ''[[MechWarrior Online]]'', developer [[Piranha Games]] sold a custom in-game unit called a Jenner, honoring the daughter of a player of the game. [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]122,210 was donated to the Canadian Cancer Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/online-gamers-donate-122-210-in-memory-of-5-year-old-1.1302334|title=Online gamers donate $122,210 in memory of 5-year-old|date=23 August 2013|work=[[CBC.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losing his wife Pauline to ovarian cancer, ''[[Minecraft]]'' player "GasBandit" built a memorial for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/5-Touching-Memorials-Video-Games-70528-p2.html|title=5 Touching Memorials In Video Games|work=Cinema Blend|publisher=Gateway Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players of the online game ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'' heard that fellow gamer "Codex Vahla" was in the hospital on life support, they held a digital [[wake (ceremony)|wake]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, M.

===Religious video games===
{{see also|Christian video game|Islamic Fun}}
Some religious groups use video games for education. An example is the Christian game ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]''.

===Use of video games in a religious setting===
In May 2012, the [[Exeter Cathedral]] used ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]'' during its Sunday service.&lt;ref&gt;Narcisse, E.

==Controversies==
{{See also|Video game controversy}}
Opinions on video games differ from religion and denomination; there are religious groups that use games actively to convert people, while some games are [[List of banned video games|banned]] for religious reasons. Scholars of religious studies are also studying video games, by looking at the game and to the players and their experiences, with games like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]''  Religion is considered a serious real world topic, while video games are an art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"/&gt; As such, developers and publishers sometimes take precaution not to offend people's religious beliefs. Religious references in the Japanese role-playing video game series ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' were originally censored for the U.S. release of the games. It was after the franchise switched to Sony's [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) that the religious references were left largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, A. The Religions Behind Final Fantasy. History of Computer Game Design: Technology, Culture, and Business March 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft's ''Assassin's Creed'' series show a disclaimer: {{blockquote| "Inspired by historical events and characters. This work of fiction was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of various religious faiths and beliefs."&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"/&gt;{{efn|In ''[[Assassin's Creed: Syndicate]]'', the words "sexual orientations and gender identities" were added.}}}}

Despite efforts from some companies, there have been incidents with religious groups and video games. The German video game rating board [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] gave ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' a 16+ rating, considering it "[[Blasphemy|blasphemous]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/182380/postmortem_mcmillen_and_himsls_.php?print=1 |title=Postmortem: McMillen and Himsl's ''The Binding of Isaac'' |last=McMillen |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund McMillen |date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' is heavily based on the notion of [[American exceptionalism]] at the turn of the 19th century, and incorporates notions taken from Christianity to support the game's dystopian themes. One aspect of this was the use of [[baptism]]. One developer on [[Irrational Games]] staff expressed strong concern to the lead developer, [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], that the game's presentation of baptism was highly controversial, leading Levine to with the developer to recast the baptism aspect as a notion of forgiveness rather than a religious tenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | title = Bioshock Infinite altered after "conversations with religious people on the team" says Levine | first = Leon | last = Hurley | date = January 18, 2013 | accessdate = January 20, 2013 | work = [[PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130122031459/http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | archivedate = January 22, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/bioshock-infinites-religious-themes-led-dev-to-consider-quitting-6404620 | title = BioShock Infinite's religious themes led dev to consider quitting | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = February 28, 2013 | accessdate = February 28, 2013 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/01/bioshock-infinite-artist-almost-resigned-over-antagonists-religious-views/ | title = BioShock Infinite artist almost resigned over game's depiction of religion | last = Petitte | first = Omri | date = March 1, 2013 | work= [[PC Gamer]] | accessdate= March 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one player objected to the final changes, prompting them to request a refund from [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name="kotaku refund"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/some-dont-like-bioshocks-forced-baptism-enough-to-as-473178476 | title = Some Don't Like BioShock's Forced Baptism.

===Hinduism===
On October 22, 2008, Microsoft announced that ''[[Fallout 3]]'' would not be released in India on the [[Xbox 360]] platform.&lt;ref name="Kotaku-India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5067039/fallout-3-not-coming-to-india |title=Fallout 3 Not Coming To India |publisher=Kotaku |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |first=Mike |last=Fahey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious and cultural sentiments were cited as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/fallout-3-withheld-from-india |title=Fallout 3 withheld from India |publisher=Games Industry |accessdate=2009-12-01 |first=Jason |last=Lee |date=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific reason was not revealed in public, it is possible that it is because the game contains two-headed mutated cows called Brahmin, or that [[Brahmin]] is also the name of an ancient, powerful hereditary caste of [[Hindu]] priests and religious scholars in India, or its similarity to the spelling of [[brahman (cattle)|brahman]], a type of cow that originated in India. Brahman, a breed of [[Zebu]], are revered by Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Are-Brahmin-The-Reason-For-Fallout-3-s-Cancellation-in-India-12947.html |title=Are Brahmin The Reason For Fallout 3's Cancellation in India? |publisher=Gaming Blend |accessdate=2011-09-04 |date=2008-10-22 |first=Pete |last=Haas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action game ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' was criticized by Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, for portraying the Hindu deity [[Hanuman]]. Developed and published in India by Aurona Technologies, the player controls Hanuman. "Controlling and manipulating Lord Hanuman with a joystick/button/keyboard/mouse [is] denigration", said Zed. "Lord Hanuman was not meant to be reduced to just a 'character' in a video game to solidify [a] company/product's base in the growing economy of India." He urged Sony, the publisher of the game, to pull the game. Sony's regional manager however said that ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' sold beyond their expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114224/Hindu_Statesman_Criticizes_Sonys_Hanuman_Boy_Warrior.php |title=Hindu Statesman Criticizes Sony's Hanuman: Boy Warrior |website=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-20 |first=Leigh |last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5217826/indias-first-game-gets-indias-first-game-controversy |title=India's First Game Gets India's First Game Controversy |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-18 |first=Owen |last=Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india/|title=Hindus Protest PS2 Game Released in India|work=GamePolitics|date=2009-04-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420175535/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india|archivedate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zed was also critical of the use of [[Hindu deities]] in the [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]''. In response, developer [[Hi-Rez Studios]] COO Todd Harris said that ''Smite'' would still be featuring Hindu deities, possibly adding more. GameSpot asked if characters based upon Abrahamic religions would be added as well, but Harris said that "the key Abrahimic figures—Adam, Noah, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, are not that interesting in character design or gameplay".&lt;ref&gt;Connor Sheridan on June 29, 2012, http://www.gamespot.com/articles/deity-based-moba-smite-will-not-use-jewish-christian-islamic-figures/1100-6384974/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fighting game]] ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' was temporarily banned in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=Ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/news/10356/injustice-gods-among-us-banned-in-uae-kuwait|date=2013-04-29|accessdate=2013-05-08|last=Fakhruddin|first=Mufaddal|publisher=[[IGN|IGN Middle East]]|title=Injustice: Gods Among Us Banned in UAE, Kuwait}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/injustice-gods-among-us-video-game-not-available-in-uae|date=2013-04-30|accessdate=2013-05-08|last=Hanif|first=Nadeem|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|title='Injustice: Gods Among Us' video game not available in UAE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the title of the game was rebranded as ''Injustice: The Mighty Among Us'' for promotional uses in those areas.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt; It is speculated that ''Injustice'' was banned because of the inclusion of the word 'Gods' in the title, the cleavage exposed in the outfits of some female characters, and overall bloodiness.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt; Eventually, the ban in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was lifted.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt;

===Sikhism===
''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' (2002) sparked controversy due to a level featuring the killing of [[Sikh]]s within a depiction of their most holy site, the [[Harmandir Sahib]], where hundreds of Sikhs [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|were massacred in 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_2440000/2440713.stm |title=Young Sikhs force changes to Hitman 2 |publisher=[[CBBC]] |date=21 November 2002|accessdate=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An altered version of ''Silent Assassin'' was eventually released with the related material removed from the game.

==Religion and violence==
A study released by the University of Missouri stated that video games often emphasize the violent aspects of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5888663/study-says-video-games-have-problematized-view-of-religion|title=Study Says Video Games Have 'Problematized' View of Religion|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Greg Perreault said "It doesn't appear that game developers are trying to purposefully bash organized religion in these games, I believe they are only using religion to create stimulating plot points in their story lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2012/0227-video-games-depict-religion-as-violent-problematized-mu-study-shows/|title=Video Games Depict Religion as Violent, Problematized, MU Study Shows|publisher=MU News Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games as focus of religious studies==
{{main|Game studies}}

For many years video games were seen as mere [[entertainment]], a form of "low culture".&lt;ref&gt;Mäyrä, F. An Introduction to Game Studies (2008). SAGE Publications. Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; Playing video games was seen as a form of [[escapism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 58&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was not regarded as a valid object of scientific research. To "play" games as a scholarly pursuit was thought of as "ludicrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticalreligion.org/2013/10/21/here-be-dragons-the-quest-for-academic-credibility/|title=Here Be Dragons: the quest for academic credibility|work=The Critical Religion Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has only been in recent years that video games have become the object of scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, J. Videogames (2012). Routledge. Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at the game as an object, researchers can explore religious and spiritual references. Video game research is done in two ways; the game can be studied as an [[object (philosophy)|object]], while [[actant|actor-focused]] research looks at the player.

===Game-immanent approach===
Video games, as products of human culture, can be seen and read as "[[Text (literary theory)|texts]]". They carry myths, stories and symbols of the time in which they were created.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Campbell, H. (ed.). Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds (2012). Rutledge. Page 145&lt;/ref&gt; By "reading" video games, philosophers, sociologists and theologians have the opportunity to study the religious and spiritual themes in video games.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, H. A. en Grieve, G. P. Studying Religion in Digital Gaming. A Critical Review of an Emerging Field. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches. Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done in several ways.

*by studying the design, rules and mechanics or by talking to the developers
*by watching others play (e.g. [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play videos]])
*by playing the game themselves&lt;ref&gt;[[Espen Aarseth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Player-focused approach===

Video games are [[Interactivity|interactive]]; it requires input from the player to happen. While a video game developer designs the game, including its rules and story, it is up to the player to make the game "happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Luke |editor-last=Cuddy |title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |date=2008 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; As such, it is up to individual player to give [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] to their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=James |title=Videogames |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games allow the player to think, form and possibly change their own opinion about religious and spiritual matters.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Players often discuss these elements on online platforms. For instance, some players made their own version of the player character [[Commander Shepard]] of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series an atheist, while others thought of him/her{{efn|Commander Shepard can be female or male.}} as a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, T. "Are Those the Only Two Solutions?" In Heidbrink, S., Knoll, T. Wysocki, J. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games Reloaded. Immersion into the Field. Volume 07 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, video games also give new meaning to the concept of religion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11318">'''Schismogenesis''' literally means "creation of division". The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words σχίσμα ''skhisma'' "cleft" (borrowed into English as [[Schism (religion)|schism]], "division into opposing factions"), and γένεσις ''genesis'' "generation, creation" (deriving in turn from ''gignesthai'' "be born or produced, creation, a coming into being").

==Concepts==
===In anthropology===
The concept of schismogenesis was developed by the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Gregory Bateson]] in the 1930s, to account for certain forms of social behavior between groups among the [[Iatmul people]] of the [[Sepik River]].  Bateson first published the concept in 1935,&lt;ref name="CCS"&gt;Bateson, Gregory (1935) Culture Contact and Schismogenesis, Man, Vol. 35 (Dec) pp.178-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEM"&gt;Bateson, Gregory (1972) [[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]], Chandler Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; but elaborated on schismogenesis in his classic 1936 ethnography ''Naven: A Survey of the Problems suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe drawn from Three Points of View'', reissued with a new Epilogue in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, Gregory. 1936. Naven: A Survey of the Problems Suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe Drawn from Three Points of View. Cambridge; Cambridge University Press; Second Edition, with a Revised Epilogue, 1958, Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "naven" refers to an honorific ceremony among the Iatmul (still practiced) whereby certain categories of kin celebrate first-time cultural achievements.  In a schematic summary, Bateson focused on how groups of women and groups of men (especially the honorees mothers' brothers) seemingly inverted their everyday, gendered-norms for dress, behavior, and emotional expression.  For the most part, these groups of people belonged to different patrilineages who not only did not regularly renew their marriage alliances, but also interacted through the mode he called schismogenesis.  Men and women, too, interacted in this mode.  And thus the naven ritual served to correct schismogenesis, enabling the society to endure.&lt;ref&gt;See Eric Kline Silverman, 2001, Masculinity, Motherhood, and Mockery: Psychoanalyzing Culture and the Iatmul Naven Rite in New Guinea.  Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1936 book ''Naven'', Bateson defined schismogenesis as "a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cumulative interaction between individuals" (p. 175).  He continued:

"It is at once apparent that many systems of relationship, either between individuals or groups of individuals, contain a tendency towards progressive change. If, for example, one of the patterns of cultural behaviour, considered appropriate in individual A, is culturally labelled as an assertive pattern, while B is expected to reply to this with what is culturally regarded as submission, it is likely that this submission will encourage a further assertion, and that this assertion will demand still further submission. We have thus a potentially progressive state of affairs, and unless other factors are present to restrain the excesses of assertive and submissive behaviour, A must necessarily become more and more assertive, while B will become more and more submissive; and this progressive change will occur whether A and B are separate individuals or members of complementary groups."

"Progressive changes of this sort we may describe as complementary schismogenesis. But there is another pattern of relationships between individuals or groups of individuals which equally contains the germs of progressive change. If, for example, we find boasting as the cultural pattern of behaviour in one group, and that the other group replies to this with boasting, a competitive situation may develop in which boasting leads to more boasting, and so on. This type of progressive change we may call symmetrical schismogenesis" (pp. 176-77). 

Somewhat analogous to [[Émile Durkheim]]'s concepts of mechanical and organic solidarity (see [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]]), Bateson understood the symmetrical form of schismogenic behavior among Iatmul men to be one of a competitive relationship between categorical equals (e.g., rivalry).  Thus one man, or a group of men, boast, and another man/group must offer an equal or better boast, prompting the first group to respond accordingly, and so forth.  Complementary schismogenesis among the Iatmul was seen by Bateson between mainly men and women, or between categorical unequals (e.g., dominance and submission).  Men would act dominant, leading women to act submissive, to which men responded with more dominance, and so forth.  In both types of schismogenesis, the everyday emotional norms or [[ethos]] of Iatmul men and women prevented a halt to schismogenesis.  The crux of the matter for Bateson was that, left unchecked, either form of schismogensis would cause Iatmul society simply to break apart.  Thus some social or cultural mechanism was needed by society to maintain social integration.  That mechanism among the Iatmul was the naven rite.  Bateson's specific contribution was to suggest that certain concrete ritual behaviors either inhibited or stimulated the schismogenic relationship in its various forms.&lt;ref&gt;For a more elaborate discussion of the concept among the Iatmul, see the section "Early Work: New Guinea and Bali" in [[Gregory Bateson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===In natural resource management===
Bateson's treatment of conflict escalation has been used to explain how conflicts arise over natural resources, including human-predator conflicts in Norway&lt;ref name="BROX"&gt;Brox, Ottar. (2000) "Schismogenesis in the Wilderness: The Reintroduction of Predators in Norwegian Forests." Ethnos, Vol. 65 (3) pp.387–404. doi:10.1080/00141840050198045.
&lt;/ref&gt; and also for conflicts among stakeholder groups in shared fisheries,&lt;ref name="HLHPAL"&gt;Harrison, Hannah L., and Philip A. Loring. (2014) “Larger Than Life: The Emergent Nature of Conflict in Alaska’s Upper Cook Inlet Salmon Fisheries.” SAGE Open, Vol. 4, pp.1–14. http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/4/4/2158244014555112&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, Harrison and Loring compare conflict schismogenesis to the [[Tragedy of the Commons]], arguing that it is a similar kind of escalation of behavior also caused by the failure of [[social institutions]] to ensure equity in fisheries management outcomes.

===In music===
[[Steven Feld]] (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;265-271), apparently in response to [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s ''[[schizophonia]]'' and borrowing the term from Bateson, employs ''schismogenesis'' to name the recombination and recontextualization of sounds split from their sources.

==Types==

Bateson, in ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind'' describes the two forms of schismogenesis and proposes that both forms are self-destructive to the parties involved. He goes on to suggest that researchers look into methods that one or both parties may employ to stop a schismogenesis before it reaches its destructive stage.

===Complementary schismogenesis===

The first type of schismogenesis is best characterized by a [[class struggle]], but is defined more broadly to include a range of other possible social phenomena. Given two groups of people, the interaction between them is such that a behavior ''X'' from one side elicits a behavior ''Y'' from the other side, The two behaviors complement one another, exemplified in the dominant-submissive behaviors of a class struggle. Furthermore, the behaviors may exaggerate one another, leading to a severe rift and possible conflict. Conflict can be reduced by narrowing [[information asymmetries]] between the two groups.

===Symmetrical schismogenesis===

The second type of schismogenesis is best shown by an [[arms race]]. The behaviors of the parties involved elicit similar or symmetrical behaviors from the other parties. In the case of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], each party continually sought to amass more nuclear weapons than the other party, a clearly fruitless but seemingly necessary endeavor on both sides.

A form of symmetrical schismogenesis exists in common sporting events, such as [[baseball]], where the rules are the same for both teams.

==Interpersonal communication==
In the field of [[communication]], complementary schismogenesis is a force that can take effect in a [[conversation]] where people have different conversational styles, "creating a split in a mutually aggravating way".&lt;ref name="TNWIM"&gt;Tannen, Deborah. [[That's Not What I Meant!]], Random House Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect causes two well-meaning individuals having a conversation to ramp up different styles, resulting in a disagreement that does not stem from actual difference of opinion. For example, if one person's conversational style favoured louder voices, while the other favoured softer speech, the first person might increase the loudness in their voice while the other spoke softer and softer, each trying to lead the conversation towards their style's conception of normal talking.&lt;ref name="TNWIM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FSTS"&gt;Feld, Steven (1994) "From Schizophonia to Schismogenesis..." In  Music Grooves, edited by Charles Keil and Steven Feld, 257-289. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="HSSS"&gt;Tannen, Deborah (2004) “He Said, She Said; Exploring the Different Ways Men and Women Communicate” Portable Professor: Linguistics. Barnes &amp; Noble Audio Lecture Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems of holding back==
Systems of holding back are also a form of schismogenesis. They are defined as "mutually aggregating spirals which lead people to hold back contributions they could make because others hold back contributions they could make."&lt;ref name="Si1"&gt;Hämäläinen, R. P., &amp; Saarinen, E. 2007. [http://www.sal.hut.fi/Publications/pdf-files/rham07a.pdf Systems Intelligent Leadership]. In R. P. Hämäläinen &amp; E. Saarinen (Eds.), Systems Intelligence in Leadership and Everyday Life: 3-38, Espoo: Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Systems intelligence]] literature, it is held that human interaction has a tendency to fall into such systems unless conscious effort is made to counter this tendency. For example, although most managers would want to give support to their team and most team members would like to receive such support many times support does not result. This is because both parties might feel that the other party is not giving enough and thus they will themselves hold back what they in the best case could give. It has been suggested that systems of holding back are "the single most important key to life-decreasing, reciprocity-trivializing and vitality-downgrading mechanisms in human life." &lt;ref name="Si2"&gt;Saarinen, E., &amp; Hämäläinen, R. P. 2007. [http://www.sal.hut.fi/Publications/pdf-files/rham07b.pdf Systems Intelligence: Connecting Engineering Thinking with Human Sensitivity]. In R. P. Hämäläinen &amp; E. Saarinen (Eds.), Systems Intelligence in Leadership and Everyday Life: 39-50, Espoo: Helsinki University of Technology, Systems Analysis Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School violence''' encompasses physical violence, including student-on-student fighting and [[corporal punishment]]; [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]], including verbal abuse; [[sexual violence]], including rape and sexual harassment; many forms of [[bullying]], including [[cyberbullying]]; and carrying weapons in school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf|title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100197-0|location=|pages=9, 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely held to have become a serious problem in recent decades in many countries, especially where weapons such as guns or knives are involved. It includes [[violence]] between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==Risk factors==

===Internalizing and externalizing behaviors===

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I. Donnerstein (Eds.), ''Aggression: Theoretical and empirical reviews''. New York: Academic. {{ISBN|0-12-278801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akers | first1 = R.

===Other individual factors===

A number of other individual factors are associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Compared to children whose antisocial conduct begins in adolescence, early starters have a worse prognosis in terms of future aggression and other antisocial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579498001734 | last1 = Patterson | first1 = G.

===Home environment===
The home environment is thought to contribute to school violence. The Constitutional Rights Foundation suggests long-term exposure to [[gun]] violence, parental [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], physical abuse of the child, and child sexual abuse teaches children that criminal and violent activities are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CRE"&gt;Constitutional Rights Foundation. (1997). [http://www.crf-usa.org/school-violence/causes-of-school-violence.html  ''Causes of school violence''].

==Prevention and intervention==
The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

* Teachers are the professional group who works directly where school bullying takes place and who spends the most time with both bullies, victims and bystanders. Thus, whether and how teachers intervene in the case of bullying is of great importance.

== Challenges in measuring violence in schools ==
Research on violence affecting children in schools is challenging for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methodological issues ===
When trying to measure the scope of violence in schools and to find out about the types of violence experienced by students, some key issues include: from what categories of the school community to collect the data; what data should be collected from each categories; and using which methods. For example, should there be studies or surveys where researchers ask students directly about violence in school, through self-reports about the violence they experienced as targets or perpetrators? Or should they be asked about incidents of violence that they have witnessed as bystanders? Should any of these questions be asked via self-administered questionnaires or questionnaires administered by researchers in schools? Does it make more sense to collect this data outside of schools, for example, through household surveys? Or through online surveys where students have access to the internet? Or is it better to rely on mechanisms for reporting incidents of violence in educational institutions when they are available, either in the schools themselves or outside schools (governmental hotlines, internet-based reporting systems, police and justice sectors, etc.)? What questions can be asked of children, using terminology that is easy to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
In most countries there are strict rules related to research involving children, as they are under the age of consent. Therefore, requesting informed consent from the children in a study involves their parents and guardians. Asking children about violence, and particularly violence they have experienced themselves, can be traumatic. Finally, researching [[Education and the LGBT community|issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/orientation in education]] and in relation to children has additional challenges. In some contexts it is not legal to discuss these issues either in schools or even outside of schools. Where it is legal, it may be considered as a very sensitive topic to be discussed with children and young people. Asking children and young people questions related to their sexual orientation and gender identity in the school setting is ethically questionable, as it could embarrass them and expose them to stigma and discrimination, unless questions are asked in strict confidence and anonymity is granted by independent researchers external to schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''sexual network''' is a [[social network]] that is defined by the sexual relationships within a set of individuals.

==Studies and discoveries==
Like other forms of social networks, sexual networks can be formally studied using the mathematics of [[graph theory]] and [[network theory]].&lt;ref name="Liljeros2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Liljeros |first= Fredrik |author2=Christofer R. Edling |author3=Luis A. Nunes Amaral |year= 2003|title= Sexual networks: implications for the transmission of sexually transmitted infections |journal= Microbes and Infection|volume= 5 |pages= 189–196 |publisher= Science direct |doi=10.1016/s1286-4579(02)00058-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liljeros2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Liljeros |first= Fredrik |author2=Christofer R.

Recent [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies&lt;ref name="Rocha2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rocha |first= L.E.C. |author2=Fredrik Liljeros |author3=Petter Holme |year= 2010|title= Information dynamics shape the sexual networks of Internet-mediated prostitution |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume= 107 | issue=13 |pages= 5706–5713 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0914080107 |pmid=20231480 |pmc=2851932|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.5706R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  have investigated sexual networks, and suggest that the statistical properties of sexual networks are crucial to the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs). Sub-graphs, both large and small, can be defined within the overall sexual network graph; for example, people who frequent particular bars or clubs, belong to a particular ethnic group or take part in a particular type of sexual activity, or are part of a particular outbreak of an STD.  In particular, [[assortative mixing]] between people with large numbers of sexual partners seems to be an important factor in the spread of STD.

In a surprising result, mathematical models predict that the sexual network graph for the human race appears to have a single [[giant component]] that indirectly links almost all people who have had more than one sexual partner, and a great many of those who have had only one sexual partner (if their one sexual partner was themselves part of the giant component). {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.

For more detailed epidemiological work, the time sequence of sexual contacts is important.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9942">'''Social network aggregation''' is the process of collecting content from multiple [[social network service]]s, such as [[Instagram]], [[Tumblr]], [[Flickr]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]], [[YouTube]],  [[List of social networking websites|etc.]] into one unified presentation. The task is often performed by a social network aggregator (such as [[Hootsuite]], [https://taggbox.com Taggbox] and [[FriendFeed]]), which pulls together information into a single location,&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070615_141976.htm |title=When Your Social Sites Need Networking |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Rachael King |date=2007-06-18 |work=[[BusinessWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or helps a user consolidate multiple social networking profiles into one profile.&lt;ref name=mashable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2007/07/17/social-network-aggregators/ |title=20 Ways To Aggregate Your Social Networking Profiles |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Stan Schroeder |date=2007-07-17 |publisher=[[Mashable]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various aggregation services provide tools or [[GUI widget|widgets]] to allow users to consolidate messages, track friends, combine bookmarks, search across multiple social networking sites, read [[RSS feed]]s for multiple social networks, see when their name is mentioned on various sites, access their profiles from a single interface, provide "lifestreams", etc.&lt;ref name=mashable/&gt; Social network aggregation services attempt to organize or simplify a user's social networking experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Upstart websites aim to consolidate social networking |author=Beth Snyder Bulik |date=2007-06-18 |publisher=[[Advertising Age]] |quote= The latest trend in the space is aggregation-websites...[which] all present variations on the theme of organizing or simplifying a consumer's social-networking experience. }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the idea has been satirized by the concept of a "social network aggregator aggregator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspot.com/News/2008/03/social-network-aggregator-aggregator-launched.html |title=Social Network Aggregator Aggregator AllMyFrickingFriends.com Launched |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Brian Briggs |date=2008-03-17 |publisher=[[BBSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other related uses of social media aggregators aside from simplifying the user's social networking experiences. Some aggregators are designed to help companies (and bloggers) improve engagement with their brand(s) by creating aggregated social streams that can be embedded into an existing website and customized to look visually intrinsic to the site. This allows potential customers to interact with all the social media posts maintained by the brand without requiring them to jump from site to site. This has the benefit of keeping customers on the brand's site for a longer period of time (increasing "time on site" metrics).

==Social network aggregators==
Social network aggregation platforms allow social network members to share social network activities like [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Stumbleupon]], [[Digg]], [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]], with other major platforms. All content appears in real time to other members who subscribe to a particular community, which eliminates the need to jump from one [[social media]] network to another, trying to keep an eye on one's interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.justmoved.in/2008/04/01/social-aggregation-defragment-your-online-life/|title=Social Aggregation: defragment your online life|date=April 1, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229172414/http://tech.justmoved.in/2008/04/01/social-aggregation-defragment-your-online-life/|archivedate=December 29, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social network aggregation systems can rely on initiation by publishers or by readers. In the publisher-initiated aggregation systems, the publishers combine their own identities, which make their readers see all aggregated content once subscribed. In the reader-initiated systems (such as [[Windows Phone 7]] people hub&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/features/default.aspx|title=Windows Phone 7 Features|accessdate=2011-11-11 |author=Microsoft |work=[[Microsoft]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Linked Internet UI&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://research.nokia.com/page/5457 |title= Linked Internet UI Concept|accessdate=2011-11-11 |author=Nokia |date=2009-09-02 | work= [[Nokia]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;), the readers combine the identities of others, which has no impact on the publishers or other readers. The publishers can still keep separate identities for different readers.

Technically, the aggregation is enabled by [[API]]s provided by social networks. For the API to access a user's actions from another platform, the user will have to give permission to the social-aggregation platform, by specifying the user-id and password of the social media to be syndicated. This concept resembles [[open ID]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alchemi.co.uk/archives/hum/aggregation_of_.html |title=Aggregation of data across social networks |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=David Jennings |date=2005-08-03 |publisher=alchemi.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that [[social network service]]s are only beginning the move away from "walled gardens" to more open architectures.  Some sites are working together on a "data portability workgroup", while others are focusing on a single sign-on system called [[OpenID]] to allow users to log on across multiple sites.  Historically, the trend from private services to more open ones can be seen across many Internet services from email and instant messaging to the move that early [[online service provider]]s made to become websites.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10880936 |title=Everywhere and nowhere |accessdate=2008-04-10 |date=2008-03-19 |publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[OpenSocial]] initiative aims to bridge the member overlap between various online social network services.&lt;ref name=alexp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.compete.com/2007/11/12/connecting-the-social-graph-member-overlap-at-opensocial-and-facebook/ |title=Connecting the Social Graph: Member Overlap at OpenSocial and Facebook |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Alex Patriquin |date=2007-11-12 |publisher=[[Compete.com]] blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap between multiple social-network services==
The attraction of social network aggregation comes from the fact that some users tend to use multiple social networks: they have accounts on several social-networking sites.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; In November 2007, Alex Patriquin of [[Compete.com]] reported on the member overlap between various online social network services:&lt;ref name="alexp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">A '''sociocultural system''' is a "human [[population]] viewed (1) in its ecological context and (2) as one of the many [[subsystems]] of a larger [[ecological systems|ecological system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena (1984). ''Cultural Anthropology, second edition.'' Stamford, Connecticut: [[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth Publishing Company]] (Cengage Learning). {{ISBN|978-0-534-02749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SCSdiagram.jpg|thumb|350px|Conceptual Model of a Sociocultural System.]] The term "sociocultural system" embraces three concepts: society, culture, and system. A society is a number of interdependent organisms of the same species.  A culture is the learned behaviors that are shared by the members of a society, together with the material products of such behaviors. The words "society" and "culture" are fused together to form the word "sociocultural". A system is "a collection of parts which interact with each other to function as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Draper L. (1980). ''Systems One: An Introduction to Systems Thinking.'' Minneapolis, MN: Future Systems Inc. {{ISBN|978-99962-805-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sociocultural system is most likely to be found in the writings of anthropologists who specialize in [[ecological anthropology]].

In 1979, Marvin Harris outlined a universal structure of sociocultural systems. He mentioned [[infrastructure]] (production and population), structure (which is behavioural, like corporations, political organizations, hierarchies, castes), and a [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] (which is mental, like beliefs, values, norms).&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W., 2013, "Harris on the Universal Structure of Society," Retrieved 2015-02-15, http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Essays/Harris1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120219 Sociocultural Systems:Principles of Structure and Change], Frank W.

{{confused|Technology readiness level}}

'''Technology readiness''' refers to people’s propensity to embrace and use new technologies for accomplishing goals in home life and at work. The construct can be viewed as an overall state of mind resulting from a gestalt of mental enablers and inhibitors that collectively determine a person’s predisposition to use new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parasuraman|first=A.|year=2000|title=Technology Readiness Index (TRI) a multiple-item scale to measure readiness to embrace new technologies|journal=[[Journal of Service Research]]|volume=2|issue=4|pages=307-320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Technology Readiness Index''' can be viewed as a variation on the [[Technology acceptance model]] (TAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/technology-readiness-index-tri/29544|title=What is Technology Readiness Index|accessdate=31 January 2016|website=igi-global.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a multidimensional [[psychographic]] construct, offering a way to segment online customers based upon their underlying positive and negative technology beliefs.

Technology readiness has four underlying dimensions:
*''optimism'', a positive view of technology and a belief that it offers people increased control, flexibility, and efficiency
*''innovativeness'', the tendency to be a technology pioneer and thought leader
*''discomfort'', perceived lack of control over technology and a feeling of being overwhelmed by it
*''insecurity'', distrust of technology and skepticism about its ability to work properly.

While optimism and innovativeness are contributors to technology readiness, discomfort and insecurity are inhibitors.

This '''timeline of the American Old West''' is a chronology ordered list of events significant to the development of the American West as a region of the United States prior to 1912. The term "[[American Old West]]" refers to a vast geographical area and lengthy time period of imprecise boundaries, and historians' definitions vary. The events in this timeline occurred primarily in the contiguous portion of the modern United States west of the [[Mississippi River]], and mostly in the period between the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the admission of the last [[contiguous United States|mainland states]] into the Union in 1912. A small section summarizing early exploration and settlement prior to 1803 is included to provide a foundation for later developments. Rarely, events significant to the history of the West but which occurred within the modern boundaries of Canada and Mexico are included as well.

Western North America was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and later served as a [[frontier]] to European powers, beginning with [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization in the 16th century. [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], and [[Russia]]n claims followed in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the [[American Revolution]], the newly independent [[United States]] began securing [[American frontier|its own frontier]] from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] westward for settlement and economic investment by American citizens. The long [[territorial evolution of the United States|history of American expansion]] into these lands has played a central role in shaping American culture, iconography, and the modern national identity, and remains a popular topic for study by scholars and historians.

Events listed below are notable developments for the region as a whole, not just for a particular state or smaller subdivision of the region; as historians Hine and Faragher put it, they "tell the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the lands, the development of markets, and the formation of states.... It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Robert V.|last2=Faragher|first2=John Mack|title=The American West : a new interpretive history|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300078358|page=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost three centuries after Columbus' voyages to the New World, much of western North America remained unsettled by European colonists, despite various territorial claims made by imperialist nations. Europeans interest in the vast territory was motivated by the search for precious metals, especially gold, and the fur trade, with miners, trappers, and hunters among the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the West.&lt;ref name=RMUtley/&gt;{{rp|150}} The early years were also a period of scientific exploration and survey, such that by 1830 the rough outline of the western half of the continent had been mapped to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=RMUtley&gt;Robert M.

'''Unisex''' refers to things that are not [[sex-specific]], being suitable for either [[sex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/unisex?view=uk obkaqfAskOxford: unisex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/unisex unisex - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be another term for [[gender-blindness]].

The term was coined in the 1960s and was used fairly informally. Though the combining form ''uni-'' is from the Latin ''unus'' meaning ''one'', the term seems to have been influenced by words such as ''united'' and ''universal'' where the ''uni-'' prefix takes on the sense of ''shared''. In this sense, it can be seen as meaning ''shared by sexes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/unisex?view=uk AskOxford: Why does 'unisex' refer to something to do with various exes, not just one sex?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hair stylists and [[beauty salon]]s that serve both men and women are often referred to as unisex. This is also typical of other services and products that had traditionally been separated by sexes, such as clothing shops or beauty products. A facility that is usually [[sex segregated]] but is not so designated may be  referred to as unisex, such as a [[public toilet]]. [[Unisex clothing]] includes garments like T-shirts; versions of other garments may be tailored for the different fits depending on one's [[sex]], such as jeans. The sharing of a pool, beach or other water or recreational facility by swimmers and others of various sexes is commonly referred to as [[mixed bathing]]. 'Mates' was the first unisex store created by Irvine Sellar in England. When a school admits students of various sexes, it may be called coeducational or a [[mixed-sex education|mixed-sex school]].

'''Virginity fraud''' (also known as '''chastity fraud,''' or the '''virginity lie''') is held to occur when someone lies about his or her [[virginity]] in order to obtain something of value. The concept is controversial, especially in view of fundamental societal disagreement over the definition and importance of virginity and [[gender role]]s (including the sexual [[double standard]]).

The archetypal case is of a woman who falsely claims to be a virgin for the sake of marriage to a man whom she suspects of insisting on, or at least valuing, virginity in his bride. (Other situations – such as two lovers who claimed to lose their virginity together on the internet as a [[publicity stunt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/137353.stm | work=BBC News | title=Virgin Web hoax was 'moral lesson' | date=July 22, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – may technically qualify, but are rarely discussed in the same context.)

==Operating concept of virginity==

Female virginity may either be defined solely according to the presence or absence of a [[hymen]],{{Dubious|date=July 2018}} or else according to more ambiguous, philosophical criteria.

In many societies, for a woman to [[dating (activity)|date]] or have [[boyfriend]]s – even if refraining from full [[sexual intercourse]] – would already be viewed as a violation of traditional values. (See [[technical virginity]]; [[honor killing]].) On the other hand, [[lesbian]] sexual activity would not normally be an object of concern. Meanwhile, a [[rape]] victim would be viewed as having lost her virginity by force.

An ancient wedding ritual, east European Slavic, involves relatives of the bride and/or groom waiting to receive the bloody sheet on which the bride was "deflowered", as "proof" of her former virginity (which would often be specified in the [[marriage contract]]). Techniques to simulate the bleeding and/or physical sensation of rupture are equally ancient. In rural Egypt, chicken blood is used if – for whatever reason – there is no real blood on the wedding night. The bloody sheet is then shown to the neighborhood as proof of virginity "deflowering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gwilliam | first= Tassie |title=Female Fraud: Counterfeit Maidenheads in the Eighteenth Century. | journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality |volume= 6 |issue= 4 | pages=518–548 |date=April  1996 | pmid=11618773 |jstor= 4617220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of detection==
{{Main|Virginity test}}

Several methods of "virginity fraud detection" claim to be available, but cannot adequately determine the status of virginity.

#Inspection to determine whether [[Hymenorrhaphy|hymen restoration surgery]] has been performed, and/or the vagina's general state of elasticity. In many  societies, such inspections have traditionally been conducted by older female relatives of the prospective groom, but are increasingly performed by doctors, who may issue certificates of virginity for the benefit of the groom's family. Also, digital inspection may fail to detect [[surgical suture]] which are visible only by means of specialized medical instruments.  However, this cannot adequately prove virginity.  As the hymen and vagina are elastic, there have been cases where women have actually given birth and had their hymen return to its original state.  Additionally, hymens can be broken through nonsexual activity such as horseback riding.
#[[Background check]]s by a [[private detective]] aimed at uncovering a woman's romantic and/or medical history.  This unfortunately relies on reporting of people who may have a score to settle with the woman being investigated. A number of attempts at virginity fraud are exposed by a woman's contact with medical clinics specializing in hymen restoration procedures.

==Public response==

In the West, awareness of hymen replacement surgery has led to criticisms of the procedure, on the grounds that it is medically unnecessary and contributes to pernicious social practices; alongside recognition that women's reasons for undergoing it are not frivolous (as might be claimed of other forms of elective plastic surgery). Little, if any, concern has been expressed for the intended victims of virginity fraud. Muslim responses have questioned the motives of women undergoing the procedure, as well as of prospective grooms whose attitudes have made the procedure so prevalent.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/3334|title=A woman’s burden of proof|author=Rafia Zakaria|date=October 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609101333/http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/3334|archivedate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a French Muslim man in [[Lille, France|Lille]] sought an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his bride (also Muslim) turned out not to be a virgin. She denied having misled him, but did not contest the appeal, which was duly granted. In 2009, amidst a wave of media attention, French justice minister [[Rachida Dati]] ordered the government to appeal this decision (on the grounds that an important element of French public policy was at issue). [[Ronald Sokol]], in an editorial for the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', writes that

::The question was whether the woman's virginity was an essential element of the marriage contract. If it was, then the contract could be annulled. If it was not, then the couple was validly married.&lt;ref name="CSMonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2009/0303/p09s01-coop.html|title=The curious case of chastity fraud|first=Ronald|last=Sokol|date=3 March 2009|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeals court reversed the judgment. Sokol continues:

::The government argued that the wife's virginity was not an essential condition because her unchaste past has no effect on married life. The judges agreed. Even if she had lied, they said, it did not matter, as a woman's lies about her past love affairs are not matters essential to her married life. In short, a woman's past is her own.&lt;ref name="CSMonitor"/&gt; 
It became known as the "Virginity Lie" case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2008/06/24/new-french-muslim-chief-on-the-virginity-lie-case/ | work=Reuters | title=New French Muslim chief on the "virginity lie" case | date=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''voluntary group''' or '''union''' (also sometimes called a '''voluntary organization''', '''common-interest association''',&lt;ref name=Prins2010&gt;Prins HEL et al. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yP6TrXRpPdMC Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge]. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|266}} '''association''', or '''society''') is a group of individuals who enter into an agreement, usually as [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, to form a body (or [[organization]]) to accomplish a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/association association] Entry at [[Dictionary.reference.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples include [[trade association]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[learned society|learned societies]], [[professional association]]s, and [[Environmental movement|environmental group]]s.

Membership is not necessarily voluntary: in order for particular associations to function correctly they might need to be mandatory or at least strongly encouraged, as is common with many [[teachers union]]s in the US. Because of this, some people use the term common-interest association to describe groups which form out of a common interest, although this term is not widely used or understood.&lt;ref name=Prins2010/&gt;

Voluntary associations may be incorporated or unincorporated; for example, in the US, unions gained additional powers by incorporating.&lt;ref&gt;Bradburn B. (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbqTcM4rrR8C&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Citizenship Revolution: Politics and the Creation of the American Union, 1774–1804]'', p. 217. [[University of Virginia Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the terms Voluntary Association or Voluntary Organisation cover every type of group from a small local Residents' Association to large Associations (often  [[Registered charity|Registered Charities]]) with multimillion-[[British pound|pound]] turnover that run large-scale business operations (often providing some kind of [[public service]] as subcontractors to government departments or local authorities).

==Differences by jurisdictions==
In many [[jurisdiction]]s no formalities are necessary to start an association. In some jurisdictions, there is a minimum for the number of persons starting an association.

Some jurisdictions require that the association register with the police or other official body to inform the public of the association's existence. This could be a tool of political control or intimidation, and also a way of protecting the economy from [[fraud]].

In many such jurisdictions, only a registered association (or in the UK an incorporated body) is a [[juristic person]] whose members are not responsible for the financial acts of the association. Any group of persons may, of course, work as an informal association, but in such cases, each person making a transaction in the name of the association takes responsibility for that transaction, just as if it were that individual's personal transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 2|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many countries where the formation of truly independent Voluntary Associations is effectively proscribed by law or where they are theoretically legally permitted, but in practice are persecuted; for example, where membership brings unwelcome attention from police or other state agencies.

==History==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
Voluntary groups are a broad and original form of nonprofit organizations, and have existed since ancient history. In [[Ancient Greece]], for example, there were various organizations ranging from elite clubs of wealthy men (''hetaireiai'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4436529 Politics on the Margins: The Athenian "Hetaireiai" in 415 BC]. ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte''.&lt;/ref&gt; to private religious or professional associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ascough, Richard S.

In preindustrial societies, governmental administrative duties were often handled by voluntary associations such as [[guild]]s. In medieval Europe, guilds often controlled towns.&lt;ref name=Kohn2003&gt;Kohn M. (2003). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=427763 Merchant Associations in Pre-Industrial Europe].

==Legal status==
A standard definition of an unincorporated association was given by [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Lord Justice Lawton]] in the [[English trust law]] case ''[[Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell]]'' (1981):&lt;ref&gt;[1981] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1981/2.html EWCA Civ 2], [1982] 1 WLR 522&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"unincorporated association" [means] two or more persons bound together for one or more common purposes, not being business purposes, by mutual undertakings, each having mutual duties and obligations, in an organisation which has rules which identify in whom control of it and its funds rests and upon what terms and which can be joined or left at will.&lt;ref&gt;The definition was for [[taxation|tax]] purposes, but was expressed to be of general application.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In most countries, an unincorporated association does not have [[legal person|separate legal personality]], and few members of the association usually enjoy [[limited liability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=XU, Y.  |author2=Ngai, N. P.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China. Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly. 40(2), 247–269 |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |url= http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/07/23/0899764009340229.abstract |publisher=Nvs.sagepub.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some countries they are treated as having separate [[legal personality]] for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom an unincorporated association is assessable to [[corporation tax]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of their lack of legal personality, [[Will (law)|legacies]] to unincorporated associations are sometimes subject to general common law prohibitions against [[Purpose trust#Unincorporated associations|purpose trusts]].

Associations that are organized for profit or financial gain are usually called [[partnership]]s.&lt;ref&gt;In most [[common law]] legal systems, partnership is defined by statute as "the relationship which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit"&lt;/ref&gt; A special kind of partnership is a [[co-operative]] which is usually founded on one person&amp;mdash;one vote principle and distributes its profits according to the amount of goods produced or bought by the members. Associations may take the form of a [[non-profit organization]] or they may be [[not-for-profit corporation]]s; this does not mean that the association cannot make benefits from its activity, but all the benefits must be reinvested. Most associations have some kind of document or documents that regulate the way in which the body meets and operates. Such an instrument is often called the organization's bylaws, constitution, regulations, or agreement of association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 85|edition = 2nd|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common law==

===England and Wales===
{{Main article|Unincorporated associations in English law}}
Under [[English law]], an unincorporated association consists of two or more members bound by the rules of a society which has at some point in time, been founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettit |first=Philip |year=2009 |title=Equity and the Law of Trusts|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19956102-5  |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theories have been proposed as to the way that such associations hold rights. A transfer may be considered to have been made to the association's members directly as [[joint tenants]] or [[tenants in common]]. Alternatively, the funds transferred may be considered to have been under the terms of a private [[purpose trusts in English law|purpose trust]]. Many purpose trusts fail for want of a [[beneficiary]] and this may therefore may result in the gift failing. However, some purpose trusts are valid, and, accordingly, some cases have decided that the rights associated with unincorporated associations are held on this basis. The dominant theory, however, is that the rights are transferred to the members or officers absolutely, perhaps on trust for the members, but are importantly bound by contracts ''[[inter se]]''.&lt;ref name="pettit6265"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettit |first=Philip |year=2009 |title=Equity and the Law of Trusts|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19956102-5  |pages=62–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, on dissolution, the distribution of these rights depends on how they were held. A purpose trust may by its nature survive the dissolution of the association, or it may not. If it fails as a result of the dissolution, then the rights will be held on [[resulting trusts in English law|resulting trust]] for the contributors, unless they can be shown to have renounced their right to such a trust in their favour. If the rights are held subject to contract, then they will be divided among the surviving membership upon dissolution, according to the terms of the contracts ''inter se'' or an implied term according to contribution. If, as a result of this contract or statute, no member can claim, the rights will pass to the Crown as ''[[bona vacantia]]''. This conclusion has also been suggested where the association dissolves because only one member remains, although this has been doubted by some commentators who believe the last members should be entitled to the rights.&lt;ref name="pettit6265"/&gt;

[[Scottish law]] on unincorporated associations is essentially the same as English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/download_file/view/357/ |title=Report on Unincorporated Associations |publisher=Scottish Law Commission |id=SCOT LAW COM No 217 |date=November 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014 |quote=We are not aware of any material differences between the law of Scotland and the law of England and Wales regarding unincorporated associations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Each state sets its own laws as to what constitutes an unincorporated association and how it is to be treated under the laws. In the United States, voluntary associations which were incorporated were "pre-eminent" in collective action.&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Companies: Organizational Aspects of Religion and Religious Aspects of Organizations, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5OBplT1ehtgC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p108]. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[California]], during the 1980s, then [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] [[Los Angeles County District Attorney|district attorney]] [[Ira Reiner]] decided to use California's unincorporated associations law to attack [[street gangs]] and the habit of their members of tagging [[graffiti]] in public spaces, in an attempt to abate vandalism and to recover cleanup costs. He sued the street gangs by name, with cases titled such as ''City of Los Angeles v. [[Bloods|The Bloods]]'' and ''City of Los Angeles v. [[Crips|The Crips]]'', which then allowed the city to go after any member of the street gang, as a member of the unincorporated association being sued, for damages resulting from graffiti tagging involving that gang's name{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.
* In [[Texas]], state law has statutes concerning unincorporated non-profit associations that allow unincorporated associations that meet certain criteria to operate as entities independent of their members, with the right to own property, make contracts, sue and be sued, with limited liability for their officers and members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonprofit Organizations|url=http://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/nonprofit_org.shtml|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York (state)|New York]] state law regarding unincorporated associations actually gives members of the association more protection against liability than that given to either stockholders of [[corporation]]s or members of [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]]. This was noted in the case{{which|date=April 2013}} of the [[Associated Press]] organization, because the members of the AP are not liable for damages for the organization's actions unless the association as a whole approved it.

===Australia===
In most Australian states and territories, a similar set of laws allows not-for-profit associations to become legal entities with a limit to the liability of their members. An example of such a law, the Associations Incorporation Act that is in force in South Australia, allows for the creation of a legal entity able to buy and sell land and in general, enter into legally binding contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associations Incorporation Act 1985|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/ASSOCIATIONS%20INCORPORATION%20ACT%201985.aspx|publisher=Government of South Australia, Attorney-General's Department|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many clubs and societies begin life as an unincorporated body and seek to attain incorporated status to protect its members from legal liability and in many cases to seek government financial assistance only available to an incorporated body. Clubs and societies wishing to incorporate must meet the provisions of the relevant state act and lodge their constitution with the corresponding state government authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to incorporate|url=http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/Associations/how/index.html|publisher=The Government of South Australia, Consumer &amp; Business Services|accessdate=17 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924075924/http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/Associations/how/index.html|archive-date=24 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
Certain [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] systems classify an '''association''' as a special form of [[contract]]ual relationship.

===Canada===
Under the [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec Civil Code]] an association is categorized as a type of statutory specific contract set forth in a constitution. An association can become incorporated with its own legal identity so that it may, e.g., open a bank account, enter into contracts (rent real estate, hire employees, take out an insurance policy), or sue or be sued.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===France===
In [[France]], all voluntary associations are non-profit. They may count as unincorporated (''association non-déclarée'') or incorporated (''association déclarée''), and are created in terms of and governed by the [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau]] Act 1901. This is why ''[[:fr:Association loi 1901|association loi (de) 1901]]'' is subjoined to their name, except in [[Alsace]]-[[Moselle]] area which is governed by local law in this regard (the area was German in 1901) and are therefore called ''[[:fr:Association loi 1908|association loi (de) 1908]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}. If the association responding to defined criteria, like social or medical help for example, they can be declared "public utility association" (''association d'utilité publique'') by French authorities. Associations act 1901 let an important large of freedom about internal operation, like direction or authorized members for example.

===Germany===
{{Main article|Eingetragener Verein}}
The [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] sets out different rights and rules for an unincorporated association (''nicht eingetragener Verein'') with legal identity (''Vereine'', art. 21-79 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]) versus an incorporated association (''eingetragener Verein'') with full [[legal person]]ality, which the law treats as partnerships (''Gesellschaften'', art. 705-740 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]). Associations can be for-profit (''wirtschaftlicher Verein''), non-for-profit (''Idealverein''), or public (''gemeinnütziger Verein'').{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], many non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are established as registered  nonprofit associations (Hebrew ''amutah,'' plural ''amutot'') (some are established as public benefit companies (Hebrew ''Chevrah LeTo’elet Hatzibur'') not to be confused with [[public benefit corporation]]s). ‘‘Amutot’’ are regulated by the Associations Law, 1980. An ''amutah'' is a body corporate, though not a company. The ''amutah'' is successor to the Ottoman Society which predated the State of Israel, and was established by the now-superseded Ottoman Societies Law of 1909, based on the French law of 1901. An ''amutah'' must register with the ''Rasham Ha’amutot'' ('Registrar of Amutot'), under the purview of the ''Rashot Hata’agidim'' ('Corporations Authority') of the [[Ministry_of_Justice_(Israel)|Ministry of Justice]].

==Freedom of association==
The freedom of association stands in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml|publisher=The United Nations|accessdate= September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Cquote|Article 20
:(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
:(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.}}

[[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] also protects the right to [[freedom of assembly]] and association.

{{Cquote|Article 11 – Freedom of assembly and association

# Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.
# No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.}}

A '''''Vorlage''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfoːɐ̯laːɡə|}}; from the [[German language|German]] for ''prototype'' or ''template'') is a prior version or manifestation of a text under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online: vorlage, n.
Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. &lt;[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679 http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679]&gt;; accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular [[manuscript]] of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Jonathan D. H., ''Contours in the Text'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a [[translation]] is called the ''Vorlage'' of that translation.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman &amp; Kuhlken, ''What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter?'' (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Luther Bible]] is a translation of the [[Textus Receptus]]. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the ''Vorlage'' of the Luther Bible.  

Sometimes the ''Vorlage'' of a translation may be lost to history.  In some of these cases the ''Vorlage'' may be reconstructed from the translation.  Such a reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may be called a ''retroversion'', and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, the ''Vorlage'' may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of [[textual criticism]].  This reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.  Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed ''Vorlage'' of the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] at parts to correct the Hebrew [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.&lt;ref&gt;Albrektson, B., "Masoretic or Mixed" in ''Text, Translation, Theology'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as another example, the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] fragments of Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] included among the [[Nag Hammadi library]] are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Slings, S. R., ''Platonis Rempublicam'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the bulk of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the ''Vorlage'' exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.&lt;ref&gt;Plisch, Uwe-Karsten ''Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar''. (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
