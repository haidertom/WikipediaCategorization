'''1835 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* Still trying to resolve the English Championship title issue, [[James Burke (boxer)|James Burke]] has two scheduled fights but neither can take place.  First, Harry Preston refuses to fight him; and then Young Langan is arrested on the eve of his fight for assaulting a police officer.&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/burke-j.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – James Burke].  Retrieved on 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 21 July — in a non-title bout between two future contenders, [[Ben Caunt]] is disqualified for an alleged foul, striking [[William Thompson (boxer)|William "Bendigo" Thompson]] when Thompson is sitting in his corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/thompson.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Bendigo].  Retrieved on 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* Powerless to prevent the use of [[roundarm|roundarm bowling]], MCC finally amends the [[Laws of Cricket]] to make it legal.  The relevant part of the Laws states: 
:: ''if the hand be above the shoulder in the delivery, the umpire must call "No Ball"''. 
* Bowlers’ hands now go above the shoulder and the 1835 Law must be reinforced in 1845 by removing benefit of the doubt from the bowler in the matter of his hand's height when delivering the ball.
* The Laws are also changed to enforce a compulsory follow on if a team is 100 runs behind on first innings.
'''England'''
* Most runs – [[James Cobbett]] 156 @ 15.60 (HS 31*)
* Most wickets – [[William Lillywhite]] 42 (BB 7–?)

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Preserve (horse)|Preserve]]
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Ibrahim
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Mündig]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – [[Queen of Trumps]]

* 7 April — [[Tinsley Lindley]] scores in his ninth consecutive [[England national football team|England]] game, a [[England national football team records|record]] that still stands.
'''Origin of the Football League'''
* One of the problems facing [[professionalism]] is the lack of competitive matches, especially for teams that have been knocked out of the [[FA Cup]].  It is self–evident that crowds for friendly fixtures are much lower, which means a reduction in revenue and consequent struggle to pay wages.
* [[Aston Villa]]'s Scottish director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]] seeks a solution by asking other professional clubs to arrange annual home and away fixtures on a competitive basis, with points to be awarded for winning and drawing.  Following a conference between club directors on 23 March, the English [[Football League]] is founded on 17 April as one division of twelve clubs.
* The founder members are: [[Accrington F.C.]] (1888–1893), [[Aston Villa]], [[Blackburn Rovers]], [[Bolton Wanderers]], [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Notts County]], [[Preston North End]], [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke F.C.]], [[West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

'''Scotland'''
* [[Scottish Cup final]] – [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] 6–1 [[Cambuslang F.C.|Cambuslang]] 
* [[Celtic Football Club]] is founded by members of the Marist Order, a teaching institute, as a way of raising money for a poor children's charity.  The club's first ground is a piece of rented land not far from the present [[Celtic Park]].  Celtic's first recorded match is a home "friendly" against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]; Celtic win 5–2 in what is therefore the inaugural "[[Old Firm|Old Firm Game]]".

'''1894 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[American football]]==
'''College championship'''
* [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|College football national championship]] – [[Yale Bulldogs]]

'''Professional championships'''
* [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit|Western Pennsylvania champions]] – [[Allegheny Athletic Association]]

'''Events'''
* The 1894 [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|Harvard–Yale]] game, known as the "Hampden Park Blood Bath", results in crippling injuries for four players; the contest is suspended until 1897. The annual [[Army–Navy Game]] is suspended from 1894 till 1898 for similar reasons.  One of the major problems is the popularity of mass formations like the [[flying wedge]], in which a large number of offensive players charge as a unit against a similarly arranged defense.  The resultant collisions often lead to serious injury and sometimes even death.

==[[Association football]]==
'''Austria'''
* Foundation of [[First Vienna FC]], which is the oldest club in Austria (22 August).
'''England'''
* [[The Football League]] – [[Aston Villa]] 44 points, [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 38, [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] 36, [[Blackburn Rovers]] 34, [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] 34, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 33
* [[1894 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] – [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] 4–1 [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at [[Goodison Park]]
* The Football League expands the Second Division from 15 to 16 clubs ahead of the 1894–95 season.  [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]] and Newton Heath ([[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]) are relegated from the First Division while [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and Small Heath ([[Birmingham City]]) are promoted.  [[Middlesbrough Ironopolis]] and [[Northwich Victoria]] are expelled from the league and three new clubs are elected: [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], [[Burton Wanderers]] (league membership 1894–97) and Leicester Fosse ([[Leicester City]]). 
* The [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] is founded prior to the 1894–95 season.  Some of its early members will eventually join the Football League.
'''Scotland'''
* [[Scottish Football League]] – [[Glasgow Celtic|Celtic]]
* [[1894 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup]] – [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 3–1 [[Glasgow Celtic|Celtic]] at [[Cathkin Park|Hampden Park]]

==[[Baseball]]==
'''National championship'''
* [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]] win the first of three successive [[National League]] championships 
'''Events'''
* The [[Temple Cup]] is introduced, lasting until 1897, and matches the National League winner and runner-up in a best–of–seven, post–season championship series.  It is also known as the "World's Championship Series" but it fails to gain fan support, partly because three of the four series held will be won by the league runner-up.  In 1894, runner-up [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] defeats champion [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]] 4 games to 0.
* 1894 is [[Major League Baseball]]'s highest scoring season as [[Boston Beaneaters]] set the current record for the most runs scored in a season (1220) and another standing record with seven players scoring 100 or more runs; in addition, [[Philadelphia Phillies]] bat .349 for the season with all four outfielders above .400, but finish fourth despite the feat

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 26 July — [[Tommy Ryan]] defeats [["Mysterious" Billy Smith]] after 20 rounds at [[Minneapolis]] to win the [[World Welterweight Champion]]ship.  Ryan will hold the title until 1898, when he vacates it to challenge for the world middleweight title
* The inaugural [[World Bantamweight Champion]] is [[Jimmy Barry]] of Chicago who is recognised following his 28th round knockout of [[Casper Leon]] at Lemont, Illinois on 15 September.  Barry retains the title until 1899 when he retires undefeated in the whole of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Boxing Zone |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/bantam.htm |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hYdW70CO?url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/bantam.htm |archivedate=2009-06-15 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[bantamweight]] division is for fighters weighing between 112 and 118&amp;nbsp;lb.

==[[Motor racing]]==
'''Origin'''
* 22 July — the world's first competitive motor race was the [[Paris–Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen]].  Although there have previously been some private events, this first real contest is organised by Paris magazine ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]''. [[Albert de Dion]] is first to arrive at Rouen in his [[de Dion-Bouton]] car, but he did not figure in the official results because his steam vehicle needed a 'stoker' and was thus ineligible. The 'official' victory was awarded to [[Albert Lemaître]] driving his 3&amp;nbsp;hp petrol engined [[Peugeot Type 5]].
* The [[internal combustion engine]] has been developed from simple gas-fuelled designs during the preceding decades to the point where several technicians such as [[Karl Benz]] in [[Mannheim]] and the partnership of [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in [[Stuttgart]] have built the first true [[automobiles]] during the 1880s.  Racing of horse-drawn carriages has been popular among its participants in the past and it is a natural progression to race the new automobiles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7955">The '''anti-jock movement''' is a loosely organized [[cyber-]][[social movement|movement]] consisting of similarly themed [[website]]s, whose goal is to challenge the perceived [[culture|cultural]] dominance of [[institution]]alized competitive [[sports]] and to raise issues of the perceived detrimental effects of such a dominance. In this regard, the term "[[jock (athlete)|jock]]" is used in its sense of "[[stereotypical]] [[sportsperson|athlete]]," although websites constituent of the Anti-jock Movement often use the term to distinguish negative or excessive interest in sports, from common or positive athletic endeavor. The stereotypical athlete can be defined as an individual who uses his or her athletic ability or abilities in an effort to gain social capital. His or her identity is intertwined with their athletic endeavor and as a result they are unable to connect with individuals who do not participate in athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20054158|title=Ethnography, the Internet, and Youth Culture: Strategies for Examining Social Resistance and "Online-Offline" Relationships|journal=Canadian Journal of Education / Revue canadienne de l'éducation|first=Brian|last=Wilson|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|volume=29|issue=1|pages=307–328|doi=10.2307/20054158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade following the year 2000, increasing recognition has been given to the existence of a movement consisting of "a group of self-described [[marginalized]] youth [who] constructed and sustained anti-jock websites, where they articulated 'dissatisfaction with and anger toward institutions that uncritically adulate hyper-masculine/high contact sport culture and the athletes who are part of this culture (i.e., the ‘jocks’)'”.&lt;ref name="Stack, M. 2006"&gt;Stack, M., &amp; Kelly, D. M. (2006). "The Popular Media, Education, and Resistance". ''Canadian Journal of Education'', 29(1), 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This "group of self-described marginalized youth" identify with the individuals who feel as though they have been marginalized by "stereotypical athlete". As a whole, the group of young people who created the anti-jock cyber movement were not students who participated in athletics. The anti-jock cyber-movement was created as support to those who feel as though they have been tormented by the 'jocks' and was initially created as a support group. As the anti-jock movement gained support, it was took on a more negative perspective against the "stereotypical athlete".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ush9CBSByIcC|title=Tribal Play: Subcultural Journeys Through Sport|last=Young|first=Kevin|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-7623-1293-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such has been cited as an act of resistance against the dominant [[mass media|media]] and cultural [[paradigm]].&lt;ref name="Stack, M. 2006" /&gt;

== Recognition ==
One of the most cited articles giving recognition to the existence of an anti-jock cyber movement is a 2002 article published by Brian Wilson (an assistant professor of Cultural Studies and Sociology, University of British Columbia) in the ''Sociology of Sport Journal'', titled "The 'Anti-Jock' Movement: Reconsidering Youth Resistance, Masculinity and Sport Culture in the Age of the Internet".&lt;ref name="Wilson, Brian 2002"&gt;Wilson, Brian. (2002). "The 'Anti-Jock' Movement: Reconsidering Youth Resistance, Masculinity and Sport Culture in the Age of the Internet". ''Sociology of Sport Journal'', 19(2), 207-234.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the article, Wilson described the movement as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The anti-jock movement is group of self-described "marginalized youth" who, through the production and consumption of anti-jock Websites, express dissatisfaction with and anger toward institutions that uncritically adulate hyper-masculine/high-contact sport culture and the athletes who are part of this culture (i.e. the "jocks"). Through these Websites, strategies of resistance against the "pro-jock" establishment are offered.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After analyzing the content of various "Anti-Jock" websites, Wilson concluded that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In one sense, the anti-jock Websites can be viewed, together, as a new social movement according to Harvey and Houle's definition. That is to say, they are not linked to specific economic interests, they are working toward change in society's (pro-jock) values, and (arguably), anti-jocks are working toward a better society where males and females are nor subject to the domination of the interests of a masculinist sport culture and jocks.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since its 2002 publication, Wilson's article has been often cited with reference to the existence of the Anti-Jock Movement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Deviance and Social Control in Sport'' by Michael Atkinson, Kevin Young; Human Kinetics Publishers, 2008.  See also, ''Sport in a Changing World'' by Howard L. Nixon, Paradigm Publishers, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constituent websites ==

Professor Brian Wilson, in his article "The 'Anti-Jock' Movement: Reconsidering Youth Resistance, Masculinity and Sport Culture in the Age of the Internet",&lt;ref name="Wilson, Brian 2002" /&gt; detailed two basic types of websites which are common within the Anti-Jock [[cyberculture|cyber]] movement.

First, [[webzine]]s devoted to opposition of the jock culture. These sites often include suggestions for activism and action against the jock establishment. Professor Wilson, referred specifically to two such sites: [http://members.tripod.com/~lucas94/index-5.html ''Spoilsports''], and the now defunct [https://web.archive.org/web/20020106215146/http://www.hsunderground.com/index.html ''High School Underground'']. There are however, other such sites, such as the [http://www.sportssuck.org/ ''International I Hate Sports Club''], which have similar objectives and content.

Second, there are personal websites, consisting of personal [[Monologue|rants]] criticizing the jock establishment, "personal interest" websites which include personal concerns which include criticism about jock culture, and third, personal sites that devote themselves exclusively to anti-jock statements.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Brian 2002" /&gt; A large part of the anti-jock movement began as a result of specific individuals who felt marginalized by stereotypical athletes and used the internet to voice their frustrations. In turn, other individuals who were experiencing the same frustrations found support within this cyber-movement.

A '''bench-clearing brawl''', sometimes known as a '''basebrawl''' or a '''rhubarb''', is a form of ritualistic fighting that occurs in sports, most notably [[baseball]] and [[ice hockey]], in which every player on both teams leave their [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]]s, [[bullpen]]s or benches, and charge the playing area in order to fight one another or try to break up a fight.

==Baseball==
[[File:Massive fenway brawl.jpg|thumb|Bench-clearing brawl at [[Fenway Park]] because of [[Coco Crisp]] getting hit by a pitch by [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]].]]
In [[baseball]], brawls are usually the result of escalating infractions, often stemming from a player being [[Hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]], or an altercation between a [[baserunner]] and [[infielder]] stemming from excessive contact in an attempted [[tag out]] (such as a runner crashing into the [[catcher (baseball)|catcher]] at home plate in an attempt to dislodge the ball, which is an [[interference (baseball)|offensive interference]] violation that may result in ejection). They are also known to occur when a batter [[charging the mound|charges the mound]]. However, few bench-clearing brawls result in serious injury, as in most cases, no punches are thrown, and the action is limited to pushing and shoving.

Unlike most other team sports, in which teams usually have an equivalent number of players on the field at any given time, in baseball the hitting team is at a numerical disadvantage, with a maximum of five players (batter, up to three runners, and on-deck batter) and two base coaches on the field at any time, compared to the fielding team's nine players. For this reason, leaving the dugout to join a fight is generally considered acceptable in that it results in numerical equivalence on the field, a fairer fight, and a generally neutral outcome, as in most cases, managers and/or umpires will intervene to restore order and resume the game. In at least one case (the infamous [[Ten Cent Beer Night]] promotion), one team (the Cleveland Indians, who were the home team) left its dugout to defend the other (the Texas Rangers, the visiting team) from its own fans (who had [[pitch invasion|stormed the field]]). 

===Penalty===
Depending on the severity of the [[unsportsmanlike conduct]], an [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] may or may not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] a brawl's participants. Since a bench-clearing brawl by definition involves ''everyone'' on both teams, it is exceedingly unlikely that all participants will be ejected, but the player or players responsible for the precipitating event are often ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2011/Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf|work=Major League Baseball|title=The Official Baseball Rules|accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fines and suspensions generally result and are issued at a later date.

==Ice hockey==
[[File:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|[[Shawn Thornton]] fighting [[Wade Brookbank]].]]

[[Fighting in ice hockey]] by [[enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]] is an established, if unofficial, part of the sport (especially in [[North America]], where the penalty rules are more permissive); the general procedure in a one-on-one fight is to let it pan out and then send both players to the [[penalty box]] with five-minute [[Major penalty|major penalties]]. Escalations beyond isolated fights, such as line brawls between groups of players on the ice, are [[violence in ice hockey|prohibited]], meaning bench-clearing brawls will result in serious consequences. General brawls can result in players being assessed [[game misconduct]] penalties and [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] from the game. This is especially the case if a player leaves the bench or [[penalty box]] to join a fight.

As in baseball, hockey brawls usually result from escalating infractions; in this case, dangerous hits, excessive post-whistle roughness, taking shots after the whistle, attacking the [[goaltender]], and hatred from competition in a game with a significant amount of inter-player violence, all contribute to bench-clearing brawls.

In the [[National Hockey League]] the penalties include, in addition to in-game penalties, an automatic 10-game suspension and a fine of $10,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26481 ''Rule 70.10&amp;nbsp;– Leaving the Players' or Penalty Bench''] in the NHL Rulebook&lt;/ref&gt; for the first player to leave his bench or the penalty box to participate in a brawl; for the second player to leave his bench or the penalty box, the penalties include, in addition to in-game penalties, an automatic five-game suspension and a fine of $5,000.

The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] rules prescribe a double minor penalty plus a game misconduct penalty for the first player to leave the bench during an altercation and a misconduct penalty for other such players;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 564&amp;nbsp;– Players Leaving the Benches During an Altercation, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; a player who leaves the penalty box during an altercation is assessed a minor penalty plus a game misconduct penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 563&amp;nbsp;– Players Leaving the Penalty Bench, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these penalties for leaving the bench, all players engaging in a fight may be penalized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 528&amp;nbsp;– Fisticuffs or Roughing, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more notable incidents was the [[Punch-up in Piestany]], a game between Canada and the Soviet Union during the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]]. The game was rougher and more dangerous than is generally accepted, and with 6:07 left in the second period, a wild fight broke out between Pavel Kostichkin and [[Theoren Fleury]], causing both teams to leave the benches for 20 minutes. The officials ordered that the arena lights be turned out, but to no avail, and the [[IIHF]] eventually declared the game void. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada a potential gold medal, and the Canadian team, disgusted at what they perceived to be a conspiracy against them, chose to leave rather than stay for the end-of-tournament festivities, from which the Soviet team were banned.

A notable [[KHL]] bench-clearing brawl saw all the players of [[Avangard Omsk]] and [[Vityaz Chekhov]], except for the goaltenders, fighting at 3 minutes and 34 seconds. The referees penalized all the players who were involved in the brawl, and called the game due to lack of players; the teams were fined 5.7 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] and had the game counted as a double loss.

==Other sports==
Bench-clearing brawls have also been known to occur in other sports, and officials in those sports have been cracking down on such brawls; in 1995, the [[National Basketball Association]] changed the penalty for leaving the bench to participate in a brawl from a $500 fine to an automatic one-game suspension.

In 2010, the [[Northern Territory Football League]] in Australia ruled that any player found to have left the interchange bench to participate in a melee would be ejected from that match; they would also have their melee fine increased by 25% and receive an automatic one-game suspension.

Bench-clearing brawls do not occur very often in [[gridiron football]]. All levels of the game penalize any "substitute who leaves the team box during a fight" (as it is worded in the high school rule books) with automatic ejection and possible further sanctions depending on the league, and the amount of equipment a football player wears increases the risk for injury in a brawl greatly. In addition, on-field umpires and referees move in immediately to break up fights, and any contact by a team member against an official will draw the immediate penalty of ejection from the game, with further sanctions by league officials virtually certain, along with [[Penalty (gridiron football)#List of penalties|on-field penalties]] that move the ball closer or farther from the goal line depending on the team sanctioned, hurting the team's winning chances far more than in other sports. One notable brawl at the college level was [[FIU–Miami football brawl|between Florida International University and the University of Miami]], where tough talk between two [[crosstown rivalry|crosstown rivals]] escalated into a brawl with severe consequences for FIU.

At least two bench-clearing brawls have taken place in the Lingerie Football League, since renamed the [[Legends Football League]]. The first came in 2009 between the [[Miami Caliente]] and the [[New York Majesty]]; that brawl eventually led to the Majesty suspending operations. Another occurred during the December 9, 2011 LFL game between the [[Toronto Triumph]] and the [[Philadelphia Passion]]. It was unclear what punishment either team would face as Toronto was already using [[replacement player]]s due to a mass walkout of the original team earlier in the year.

===High school and scholastic sports===
Bench-clearing brawls are prohibited in scholastic competition with the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] specifying the penalty for leaving the bench area to participate in a fight in any sanctioned sport as an automatic [[ejection (sports)|ejection]] and, if actively involved in a fight, an automatic [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]]. In addition, school administrators may implement more severe penalties such as disqualification from activities, academic suspension or [[Expulsion (education)|expulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.nfhs.org/vango/custom/resourcelibrary/|title=NFHS Resource Library|work=National Federation of State High School Associations|accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more severe instances, entire schools can face sanctions from their state's athletic association, ranging from letters of reprimand, forfeiture of contests, withholding of travel expenses and extended suspensions of players and coaches to, in the most severe cases, cancellation of a team's entire season or suspension of a school's entire athletic program.

'''BodyCode Training System''' is a technique for evaluating and correcting movement patterns using specifically designed equipment. It deals with how people construct awkward postures, and how to maintain and apply intervention strategies to correct them. It was developed in the 1990s by Pino Carbone.&lt;ref name=EE/&gt; It is mainly used by dancers and athletes but can be used by anybody. It is among the curricula of [[Boston Ballet|Boston Ballet School]], the [[National Ballet of China|Chinese National Ballet]], [[English National Ballet School]], and other private ballet school.&lt;ref name=TR/&gt;

BodyCode Training System includes [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic activities]], [[Isometric exercise|isometric]] and [[Isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic exercises]] and proprioceptive movement, as well as static and dynamic activities.&lt;ref name=EE/&gt; The specific set of exercises suitable for an individual is designed by a trainer after a postural examination.&lt;ref name=TV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telva.com/2008/05/27/estarbienfitness/1211878356.html|title= Body-Code|publisher=Telva|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Carbone was awarded Geneva’s international inventor’s prize for designing BodyCode equipment called SpheralMind.&lt;ref name=TF/&gt;

== History ==
BodyCode Training System was developed by Pino Carbone. Carbone was a professional dancer for several years before he had an accident in the 1980s during the rehearsal of a ballet that affected his back and resulted in a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]]. Following his injury, he had to incorporate acupuncture, Pilates, Gyrotonics [[yoga]], [[massage]] and [[physical therapy]] in his regimen in order to continue with his dancing. At that time, he started research to develop a training system for strengthening and stretching muscles without the risk of injury that he could use.&lt;ref name=TR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mujer.terra.es/muj/articulo/html/mu225597.htm|title= Body Code: cuerpo y men| publisher=Terra|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of research and work, he developed the BodyCode System in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-19-01-2008/abc/Sabados/%C2%A1a-moverse!-body-code-en-forma-sin-desgaste_1641570674316.html |title=¡A moverse! Body Code, en forma sin desgaste|publisher=ABC.es|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carbone, he was tired of dancing in pain. He wanted to settle down and open his own studio. By then he was already doing [[Gyrotonics]] with Juliu Horvath, in New York City, so he decided to open his first studio in [[Florence]] and offer training that combined principles of yoga, dance, Gyrotonics and [[Pilates]].&lt;ref name=TF/&gt;

Although Carbone primarily worked with dancers and athletes, in the early 1990s, he began collaborating with orthopaedics, neurosurgeons and other medical specialists.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;&lt;ref name=RR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reportpistoia.com/archivio-benessere/6954-che-cosa-e-il-metodo-bodycode.html|title= Che cosa è il metodo Bodycode|publisher=Report Pistoia|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is taught in dance programs worldwide.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;

== Principles ==
BodyCode exercises are based on the principles of harmonizing body and mind. The basis of the method is to restore the physical as well as mental balance. Theories of BodyCode have oriental roots and are related to [[acupuncture]], yoga, dance and [[feng shui]].&lt;ref name=EL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.es/belleza/cara-cuerpo/en-forma-con-body-code|title=La nueva disciplina para poner a punto cuerpo y mente|publisher=Elle Spanish|accessdate=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227175444/http://www.elle.es/belleza/cara-cuerpo/en-forma-con-body-code#|archive-date=2014-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws influences from Gyrotonics as well as Pilates.&lt;ref name=TF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=1642|title= An Interview with Pino Carbone|publisher=The Florentine|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BodyCode also employs basic principles of traditional gymnastics and dance movements. The purpose of the method is to improve the body movement and postural alignment.&lt;ref name=TR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Elle Spanish|title=El Codigo Da Pino|date=September 2008|pages=233, 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; BodyCode Training System includes [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic activities]], [[Isometric exercise|isometric]] and [[Isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic exercises]] and proprioception exercises as well as static and dynamic activities.&lt;ref name=EE/&gt; It deals with how people construct awkward postures, and how to maintain and apply intervention strategies to correct them.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;

== Approach and equipment ==
There are various pieces of equipment designed by Carbone for performing different body movements. Some of these are handmade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanitatis.com/cache/2008/09/18/tendencias_30_bodycode_fusion_entre_cuerpo_mente.html|title=BodyCode o la fusión entre cuerpo y mente|publisher=Vanitatis|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include ''Pegasus'', ''SpheralMind'', ''ProArch'', ''Geometrix'', ''Elvis'', ''Dance Ruler'' and ''MasterStretch''.&lt;ref name=TV/&gt; ''MasterStretch'' is developed for improving the flexibility of the spine and coordination and proprioception.&lt;ref name=EE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/evasion/gente-estilo/noticias/480996/04/08/Body-Code-la-manera-de-hacer-ejercicio-en-el-siglo-XXI.html |title=Body Code, la manera de hacer ejercicio en el siglo XXI|publisher=El Economista|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbone holds the trademark for BodyCode system as well as several equipment design patents. Only legally authorized instructors can lawfully provide BodyCode training. Before beginning BodyCode training, an individual's posture and balance are evaluated in order to determine their weaknesses and their requirements. Following this assessment, the instructor prepares a program that is focused on rebalancing the body.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; The first phase of evaluating body posture is called ''decoding'' and the second phase of training to improve balance is called ''coding''.&lt;ref name=PL&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Pilates Lifestyle|title=Body Talk – Cracking the Code of Movement|first=Heidi|last=Dvorak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work in ===
BodyCode uses the concept of work-in as opposed to work-out. According to this concept, the physical imbalance, stress, trauma, bad habits and poor posture should not be corrected externally but internally. The individuals while practising this technique are taught  to be aware of their body characteristics and how to train it.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;

== In the media ==
The BodyCode System was featured in Marie Claire Spanish in the article ''Top ten en gimnasios - El más barato (Top ten cheapest gym equipment)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marie-claire.es/belleza/cuerpo/fotos/fotos-gimansios-10/fotos-10-gimnasios-10___12219|title=Top ten en gimnasios - El más barato|publisher=Marie Claire|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In team sports, '''captain''' is a title given to a member of the team.  The title is frequently honorary, but in some cases the captain may have significant responsibility for strategy and teamwork while the game is in progress on the field.  In either case, it is a position that indicates honor and respect from one's teammates – recognition as a leader by one's peers. In [[association football]]  and [[cricket]], a captain is also known as a '''skipper'''.

Depending on the sport, team captains may be given the responsibility of interacting with game officials regarding application and interpretation of the rules. In many team sports, the captains represent their respective teams when the match official does the [[coin toss]] at the beginning of the game. 

Various sports have differing roles and responsibilities for team captains. 

Some of the greatest captains in history are the ones with the most subtle of traits that are required for success. From Sam Walker in his book "The Captain Class" he states that a captain is "the most important factor for a team's success".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/captains-of-best-sports-teams-shared-7-traits-2017-8#1-they-are-relentless-1|title=Forget charisma and skill — the captains of the best teams in sports history shared 7 subtle traits|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{see|Captain (association football)|Captain (Australian rules football)|Captain (baseball)|Captain (cricket)|Captain (ice hockey)|Rugby league captain|National Football League team captains|Skip (curling)|Captain (inline hockey)}}

== Responsibilities of a captain ==
The responsibilities of a captain vary from sport to sport, but overall help determine the game. In sports like cricket or volleyball, the decision for the two teams to be on either defense or offense is determined with a coin toss and a decision made by the captains. This decision is crucial for the captain because they will decide the beginning of the game and quite possibly how it all plays out.

A captain is also the first one a referee looks to while explaining the results of a play or giving a foul, or flag. Often times a referee will not discuss these matters with any other player than a captain or a coach. This is important because the reaction of the captain may or may not determine how the referee will proceed. A captain must stay calm and cool headed when talking with a referee to ensure the most accurate determinants of the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4930">'''Circuit training''' is a form of body conditioning or [[endurance training]] or [[resistance training]] using high-intensity. It targets strength building or muscular endurance. An exercise "circuit" is one completion of all prescribed exercises in the program. When one circuit is complete, one begins the first exercise again for the next circuit. Traditionally, the time between exercises in circuit training is short, often with rapid movement to the next exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportireland.ie/Coaching-Ireland/Publications-/Circuit-Training.pdf|title=CIRCUIT TRAINING.

The program was developed by R.E. Morgan and G.T. Anderson in 1953 at the [[University of Leeds]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="UNM"&gt;{{cite web

==Typical activities in a circuit training==
A circuit should work each section of the body individually. Typical activities include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmac.co.uk/circuit.htm|title=Circuit Training|author=Brian Mackenzie|work=brianmac.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of circuit training==
Studies at Baylor University and The Cooper Institute show that circuit training is the most time efficient way to enhance cardiovascular fitness and muscle endurance. Studies show that circuit training helps women to achieve their goals and maintain them longer than other forms of exercise or diet.&lt;ref name="Curves"&gt;Heavin, Gary and Colman, Carol, C. Reprint edition (December 7, 2004). ''Curves: Permanent Results Without Permanent Dieting'', {{ISBN|0-399-52956-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan and Anderson claim:

Perhaps a most profound finding of this study, from a health perspective, is that this investigation clearly shows that performance of this circuit of exercises,this level of intensity elicited oxygen consumption values (39% to 51.5% of VO2max) that meet established guidelines of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) for the recommended intensity (40% to 85% of [[VO2max]]R) of exercise for developing and maintaining cardio-respiratory fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klika|first=Brett|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|url=http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx#P98 |publisher=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|accessdate=20 September 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this circuit not only provides a suitable muscular fitness stimulus but also helps to meet ACSM cardiovascular guidelines and the newly published Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 for physical activity.&lt;ref name="UNM" /&gt;
}}

One advantage is that reduced station times will encourage the participants to lift heavier weights, which means they can achieve overload with smaller number of repetitions: typically in the range of 25 to 50 depending on their training goals.&lt;ref name="ACSM"&gt;http://westvalley.edu/academics/pe_department/physical_education/programs/weighttraining/acsm-resistancetraining.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Code of Points''''' is a rulebook that defines the scoring system for each level of competition in gymnastics. There is not a universal international ''Code of Points'', and every oversight organization — such as the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] ([[International Gymnastics Federation|Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]]), [[NCAA]] Gymnastics, and most national gymnastics federations — designs and employs its own unique ''Code of Points''. 

== The FIG Code of Points ==
Gymnasts competing at lower levels or outside the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]'s jurisdiction (e.g., [[NCAA]] gymnastics and local club teams) may not be scored according to the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] code.

=== 2006 Revised Code ===
In 2006, the ''Code of Points'' and the entire gymnastics scoring system were completely overhauled. The change stemmed from the judging controversy at [[2004 Olympics]] in [[Athens]], which brought the reliability and objectivity of the scoring system into question, and arguments that execution had been sacrificed for difficulty in artistic gymnastics. It follows a similarly radical scoring change in [[figure skating]] that also was prompted by irregularities in judging at major events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/6092731/ "[[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] considers gymnastics rules changes"] Associated Press, September 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in major events in 2006, the ''Code'' has faced strong opposition from many prominent coaches, athletes and judges. Proponents of the new system believe it is a necessary step in advancing gymnastics, promoting difficult skills and increasing judging objective. Opponents feel that people outside the gymnastics community will not understand the scoring and will lose interest in the sport, and that, without emphasising artistry, the essence of gymnastics will change. Many opponents of the new scoring system feel that this system, in essence, chooses the winners before competition ever begins. Competitors no longer compete on the same level. Each contestant begins with a unique start value; therefore, contestants assigned a lower start value or difficulty rating are knocked out of the winner's circle before the competition begins. They may compete, but they cannot win. A competitor with a higher difficulty rating will begin competition with a higher combined base score. There has been dissent over the fact that the new ''Code'' effectively abolishes the "perfect 10" score, for many years one of the hallmarks of gymnastics. There has also been concern that the new ''Code'' strongly favors extreme difficulty over form, execution and consistency. At the 2006 World Championships, for instance, [[Vanessa Ferrari]] of Italy was able to controversially win the women's all-around title despite a fall on the [[balance beam]], in part by picking up extra points from performing more high-difficulty skills on [[floor exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20618167-11088,00.html "Dasha's near miss"] ''Herald Sun,'' October 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2005-04-27-gymnastics-scoring-changes_x.htm "Scoring changes in gymnastics studied"] Nancy Armour, Associated Press, April 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intlgymnast.com/news/2005/apr.html "Champions rally against ''Code''] ''International Gymnast,'' April 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 report of the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]'s Athletes' Commission, drafted after a review and discussion of the year's events noted several areas of concern including numerous inconsistencies in judging and evaluation of skills and routines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/LOB/media/MEDIA14269.pdf 2006 Report of the FIG's Athletes' Commission] International Gymnastics Federation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the leadership of the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] remains committed to the new ''Code.'' While small revisions have been made to the ''Code,'' there is currently no indication that it will be significantly altered{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} or that there will be a return to the old ''Code'' or 10.0 scoring system. 

The current ''Code of Points'' covers the years 2017 to 2020. Following past editions, there is no top score of 10.0, nor is there an upper limit of the difficulty score. Official men's skills are rated from A to H and women's skills from A to I. 

====Table of elements====

The ''Table of Elements'' is the section of the ''Code of Points'' which is used to identify, classify and assign value to gymnastics elements. Every acrobatic and dance skill is listed, illustrated and assigned a specific difficulty rating. Currently, difficulty ratings for both the women's and men's code range from A (with assigned numerical value of 0.10; easiest) to I (with assigned numerical value of 0.90; most difficult) for all apparatus except vault. Currently, every vault is assigned a specific points value which range from 2.0 to 7.2. The ''Table of Elements'' is the one aspect of the ''Code'' that did not undergo major changes in the 2006 ''Code'' overhaul.

As other aspects of the ''Code,'' the ''Table of Elements'' is frequently re-evaluated. Skills listed in the ''Table'' may have their difficulty ratings raised or lowered after evaluation by the FIG Technical Committee. In addition, skills that are determined to be too dangerous to the athletes may be banned outright. The Technical Committee may also give specific hazardous skills artificially low difficulty ratings to deter gymnasts from trying to compete them.

Many of the skills in the ''Table of Elements'' are named after gymnasts. An original element is named after an athlete when he or she is the first person to successfully perform it at a World Championships or Olympics. Gymnasts and their coaches must submit their original skill to the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] before the meet for evaluation and possible inclusion in the ''Table of Elements''.

====Judging and score tabulation====

Two panels of judges score every single routine, evaluating different aspects of the performance. The final mark is the combined total of these two scores.

The '''D-score''' (or difficulty score) evaluates the content of the exercise on three criteria: difficulty value (DV), composition requirements (CR) and connection value (CV).

* '''DV:''' The difficulty value of the eight highest value elements of the routine, including the dismount, are added together. Elements are ranked depending on their difficulty; for example on beam, a back layout salto to two feet is given a difficulty of E, and a back layout salto with a full twist is given a difficulty of G.  For a G skill a gymnast earns 0.7; for an E, he or she earns 0.5 points.
* '''CR:''' Gymnasts must demonstrate skills from four required Element Groups on each apparatus. A gymnast may use skills to fulfill the DV and the CR simultaneously. For each CR presented, 0.5 points are awarded. A maximum score of 2.00 points may be earned here. From 2008-2016, there were five different Element Groups for each apparatus, allowing a gymnast to earn up to 2.5 points. In the 2017 Code of Points, it was reduced down to four.
* '''CV:''' Extra points are given for connections of two or more elements of specific value, with 0.1 or 0.2 points apiece up to a maximum of 0.4 in total for connection

Although the A judging panel does not take deductions, they may decide not to give gymnasts DV or CR points for elements that are performed with falls. A gymnast may also lose CV credit if there are extra steps or pauses between skills that are meant to be connected.

The D-score is open-ended; in theory a gymnast could obtain unlimited points by performing connected skills although this was made harder in the 2009-2012 revision of the code when the number of elements that counted towards the D-score was lowered.

'''The E-score''' (or Execution score) evaluates the performance: the execution and artistry of the routine.

* The base score is 10.0. Judges do not add to this, but rather, take away points for errors in form, artistry, execution, technique and routine composition. There is a 1.0 mark deduction for falling off an apparatus.  Errors are judged to be small, medium or large and respective 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 deductions are applied.

The D-score and E-score are added together for the gymnast's final mark.

This judging system applies to all WAG and MAG events '''except [[Gymnastics vault|vault]]'''.  Vault scoring is somewhat different:

* Every vault has been assigned a specific points value in the ''Code''. The D-score is simply this value. Every gymnast performing the same vault will receive the same number of points.
* The E-score is the most important on this apparatus. Judges on this panel work from a 10.0 base mark and deduct for form, technique, execution and landing.

As with other apparatus, the D-score and E-score are added together for the gymnast's final mark.

There are several acts that completely invalidate the vault and result in a score of 0. These include receiving spotting (assistance) from a coach, going before the signal and not using the U-shaped safety mat for [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko-style vaults]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/index2.jsp?menu=RULES Code of Points] International Gymnastics Federation, 2006-2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://universalsports.nbcsports.com/articles/inside_sport/171?sport_id=13 "Artistic gymnastics judging"] NBC Olympics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-2006 Code ===

'''Skills:''' Every acrobatic and dance element was awarded a specific difficulty rating, ranging from A (easiest) to I (hardest) in the ''Table of Elements''. Gymnast earned bonus points by performing difficult skills alone or in combination.

'''Required elements''': Routine composition was decided by the gymnast and his or her coaches, however, on every apparatus except vault there was a list of required elements (similar to the EGR in the new ''Code'') that had to be performed during the routine. Examples of required elements included 360 degree turns on [[balance beam]] and a backwards [[Somersault|salto]] (somersault) on [[floor exercise]].

'''Base score''': The base score was the default Start Value of the routine, provided the gymnast fulfilled all required elements. This changed over the years and tended to lower as the codes went on. For instance, for the 1992-1996 code, a base score of 9.4 was awarded if all of the basic elements were fulfilled. For the 1996-2000 code, the base score was a 9.0. Finally, a base score of 8.8 was awarded for the 2000-2004 Olympic years. Before the new code, the base score again dropped to an 8.6 but this was not adopted for a very long time (only 2005-2006).

'''Start Value''': The Start Value (SV) of each routine was determined by adding the base score to the bonus points earned from performing difficult elements and combinations. Ideally, a gymnast wanted to have an SV as close to 10.0 as possible.

On vault, every vault was assigned a specific Start Value in the ''Code''.

The score was determined by subtracting any deductions for poor form, execution, steps, falls or other infractions from the SV.

The '''Commonwealth Games Federation''' ('''CGF''') is the international organisation responsible for the direction and control of the [[Commonwealth Games]] and [[Commonwealth Youth Games]], and is the foremost authority in matters relating to the games. The headquarters of CGF are located in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/about/role.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation – The Role of The CGF|website=''thecgf.com''|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Due to the success of the first [[1930 British Empire Games]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Canada, a meeting of representatives from Great Britain, its [[British dominion|dominions]], [[Crown colony|colonies and territories]] decided that the games, similar to the [[Olympic Games]] should be held every four years, and that an authoritative organisation should be formed. Following the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], it was decided to form the ''"British Empire Games Federation"'' who would be responsible for the organising of the games. The name of the federation was changed in 1952 to the ''"British Empire and Commonwealth Games Federation"'', and again in [[Jamaica]] in 1966 to the ''"British Commonwealth Games Federation"'', until eventually being changed again in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] in 1974 to the ''"Commonwealth Games Federation"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/games/story.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation – The Story of The Commonwealth Games|website=''thecgf.com''|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The federation is governed by the General Assembly and Executive Board:

===General Assembly===
The General Assembly is the ultimate governance and authority in the CGF with powers to vote on decisions, including on which cities and Commonwealth Games Association's will host the [[Commonwealth Games]]. It consists of 3 or more representatives of a 'Commonwealth Games Association' (CGA) of each member countries and territories, the Vice-Patron, Life Vice-Presidents and the members of the Executive Board.

Sessions of the General Assembly are chaired by the CGF President, with each CGA and the President having one vote. However the Vice-Patron, Life Vice-Presidents, the Executive Board, representatives of an Organising Committee (OC) of a Commonwealth Games and observers invited by the President may deliberate but do not have voting powers at the General Assembly.

===Executive Board===
The Executive Board are representative of the Commonwealth Games Associations (CGA) which form the General Assembly, and have authority to act on behalf of the federation concerning the games. The board consists of the ''[[ex officio]]'' Vice-Patron (currently, [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|HRH The Earl of Wessex]]), the President, six officers of CGF and six Vice-Presidents representing, and being responsible for the CGA's in the 6 regions of the CGF (Africa, Americas, Asia, [[Caribbean]], Europe and Oceania).

Members of the Executive Board are either elected or appointed, generally holding office from their date of appointment to the conclusion of the General Assembly held in the year following the next [[Commonwealth Games]], some being re-elected or re-appointed. The Vice-Patron is elected at the General Assembly and usually remains in office for life.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;

==Honours==
[[Image:Commonwealth Games Federation Logo.svg|thumb|Flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation and the games movement]]
As well as awarding medals to athletes, the federation may award membership of the [[Order of Merit]] for distinguished services rendered to the Commonwealth Games movement, including the games themselves, to the federation and to a Commonwealth Games Association. The honour is awarded on the recommendation of the Executive Board at the General Assembly.

On recommendation of the Executive Board, at General Assembly the federation may also elect Life Vice-Presidents, providing there are no more than six Life Vice-Presidents at a time as an award for services to the CGF. Former Chairmen and presidents automatically become a Life Vice-President.

==Bidding Procedures and Hosting==
''see: [[Bids for the 2014 Commonwealth Games]], [[Bids for the 2018 Commonwealth Games]]''

The General Assembly of the CGF are responsible for deciding who will host the [[Commonwealth Games]], 8 years prior to the games in question once all bids have been submitted. The selection process is made in accordance with the Candidate City Manual, as drafted by the Executive Board and made available to candidates 18 months before a decision is made. The federation then entrusts the organisation of the games to the organising committee, CGA, and government of the winning host nation or territory, including the security and finance, but is still monitored by the federation.

==Leadership==
The '''President of the Commonwealth Games Federation''' is responsible for chairing the Executive Board and the General Assembly. A candidate is elected to the position by the General Assembly the year following the [[Commonwealth Games]]. Other duties include inviting the [[Head of the Commonwealth]] for the opening and closing declaration of the games and overseeing the preparations for upcoming events.

Previously before the [[1998 Commonwealth Games|XVI Commonwealth Games]] in 1998, the President was a ceremonial role, taking on the duties of the now Vice-Patron. The chairman was elected by the General Assembly as head of the Commonwealth Games Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/games/cgf_heads.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation – Heads|website=''thecgf.com''|dead-url=|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These exercise trends are contributing to the rising rates of chronic diseases including: [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]] and [[high cholesterol]].&lt;ref name="CDC2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/physicalactivity/physicalactivity.htm|title=N C H S - Health E Stats -  Physical Activity Among Adults: United States, 2000 and 2005|work=CDC|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active transport (walking, bicycling, etc.) has been found to be inversely related to obesity in Europe, North America, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bassett DR, Pucher J, Buehler R, Thompson DL, Crouter SE|title=Walking, cycling, and obesity rates in Europe, North America, and Australia|journal=J Phys Act Health|volume=5|issue=6|pages=795–814|date=November 2008|pmid=19164816|doi=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus exercise has been associated with a decrease in mortality.&lt;ref name=CDC2007/&gt;

==Causes of lack of exercise==
{{See also|Sedentary lifestyle|Lack of physical education}}
One of the causes most prevalent in the developing world is urbanization.  As more of the population moves to cities, population over-crowding, increased poverty, increased levels of crime, high-density traffic, low air quality and lack of parks, sidewalks and recreational sports facilities leads to a less active lifestyle.&lt;ref name=WHOX/&gt;

Physical inactivity is increasing or high among many groups in the population including: young people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_young_people/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Young People|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_women/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Women|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_olderadults/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Older Adults|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 population study in south Brazil showed physical inactivity during leisure time to be more prevalent among females and those living with a partner; with a positive correlation associated with age and number of cigarettes smoked, and a negative correlation (decreased levels of physical inactivity) associated with years of formal education, body mass index, and increasing socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=Brazil2005/&gt;

Studies in children and adults have found an association between the number of hours of television watched and the [[prevalence]] of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gortmaker SL, Must A, Sobol AM, Peterson K, Colditz GA, Dietz WH|title=Television viewing as a cause of increasing obesity among children in the United States, 1986–1990|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med|volume=150|issue=4|pages=356–62|date=April 1996|pmid=8634729|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170290022003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vioque J, Torres A, Quiles J|title=Time spent watching television, sleep duration and obesity in adults living in Valencia, Spain|journal=Int.

Disord.|volume=24|issue=12|pages=1683–8|date=December 2000|pmid=11126224|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0801434|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tucker LA, Bagwell M|title=Television viewing and obesity in adult females|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=81|issue=7|pages=908–11|date=July 1991|pmid=2053671|pmc=1405200|doi=10.2105/AJPH.81.7.908|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/81/7/908|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2008 meta analysis found that 63 of 73 studies (86%) showed an increased rate of [[childhood obesity]] with increased media exposure, and rates increasing proportionally to time spent watching television.&lt;ref name="www.commonsensemedia.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/CSM_media+health_v2c%20110708.pdf|title=www.commonsensemedia.org|format=pdf|work=Ezekiel J. Emanuel|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause in the case of children is that physical activity in activities from self-propelled transport, to school physical education, and organized sports is declining in many countries.&lt;ref name="Kids2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dollman J, Norton K, Norton L|title=Evidence for secular trends in children's physical activity behaviour|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=39|issue=12|pages=892–7; discussion 897|date=December 2005|pmid=16306494|pmc=1725088|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.016675|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
[[Noncommunicable diseases]], partly due to a lack of exercise, are currently the greatest [[public health]] problem in most countries around the world.&lt;ref name=WHOX/&gt;  Each year at least 1.9 million people die as a result of physical inactivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/moveforhealth/en/|title=WHO &amp;#124; Why "Move for Health"|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which makes inactivity one of the leading [[preventable causes of death]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ|title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data|journal=Lancet|volume=367|issue=9524|pages=1747–57|date=May 2006|pmid=16731270|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==

===Australia===
Australian children between 1961 and 2002 have had a marked decline in their aerobic fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomkinson GR, Olds TS|title=Secular changes in aerobic fitness test performance of Australasian children and adolescents|journal=Med Sport Sci|volume=50|issue=|pages=168–82|year=2007|pmid=17387257|doi=10.1159/0000101361|url=|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Obese people are less active than their normal weight counterparts.  In Canada, 27.0% of [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] men are obese as opposed to 19.6% of active men.&lt;ref name="Tjepkema2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tjepkema M|chapter=Measured Obesity–Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight|title=Nutrition: Findings from the Canadian Community Health Survey|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=2005-07-06|location=Ottawa, Ontario|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lean people are more fidgety than their obese counterparts; this relationship is maintained even if normal weight people eat more or the obese person loses weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levine JA, Lanningham-Foster LM, McCrady SK, Krizan AC, Olson LR, Kane PH, Jensen MD, Clark MM|title=Interindividual variation in posture allocation: Possible role in human obesity|journal=Science|year=2005|pages=584–6|volume=307|issue=5709|pmid=15681386|doi=10.1126/science.1106561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National data indicates that only 10% of Canadian youth are meeting the guideline for screen time of less than 2 hours per day.  As well, although 2/3 of families live close enough for their children to bike or walk to school, only 1/3 report actually walking to school and 80% report never having cycled to school.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Asia and China===
A study from China found [[urbanization]] reduced daily energy expenditure by about 300–400 kcal and going to work by car or bus reduced it by a further 200 kcal.&lt;ref name="James2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=James WP|title=The fundamental drivers of the obesity epidemic|journal=Obes Rev|volume=9|issue=s1|pages=6–13|date=March 2008|pmid=18307693|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00432.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid decline in physical activity has occurred between the 1980s and the 2000s.  The decline in physical activity is attributed to increasing technology in the workplace and changing leisure activities.&lt;ref name="FAOChina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0442e/a0442e06.htm|title=The double burden of malnutrition Case studies from six developing countries|work=Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 65% of Chinese had jobs that required heavy labor.  This decreased to 51% in the year 2000.&lt;ref name=FAOChina/&gt;

Among Asian children between 1917 and 2003 little change has been seen in power and speed however endurance has decreased substantially in the last 10–15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macfarlane DJ, Tomkinson GR|title=Evolution and variability in fitness test performance of Asian children and adolescents|journal=Med Sport Sci|volume=50|issue=|pages=143–67|year=2007|pmid=17387256|doi=10.1159/0000101358|url=|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In [[Finland]] leisure-time physical activity has increased, while occupational and commuting physical activity has decreased from 1972 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Fin2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borodulin K, Laatikainen T, Juolevi A, Jousilahti P|title=Thirty-year trends of physical activity in relation to age, calendar time and birth cohort in Finnish adults|journal=Eur J Public Health|volume=18|issue=3|pages=339–44|date=June 2008|pmid=17875578|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm092|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leisure-time physical activity increased from 66% (1972) to 77% (2002) in men and from 49% (1972)to 76% (2002) in women.  Physically demanding work decreased from 60% (1972) to 38% (2002) in men and from 47% (1972) to 25% (2002) in women.  Daily commuting activity decreased from 30% (1972) to 10% (2002) in men and from 34% (1972) to 22% (2002) in women.&lt;ref name=Fin2008/&gt;

===Netherlands===
As of 2007 [[walking]] and [[cycling]] as a means of transport In the [[Netherlands]] has been stable since 1994. The average Dutch citizen in the year 2007 walked {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} and cycled {{convert|908|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=37338&amp;D1=2&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=6-7&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=a&amp;HDR=G1,T,G4,G2&amp;STB=G3,G5&amp;VW=T|title=statline.cbs.nl|work=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek|accessdate=Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CrossFit has been a trend in The Netherlands since 2012. It is a unique training program that combines a [[physical exercise]] philosophy and a competitive fitness sport.  '''CrossFit''' workouts use elements from [[high-intensity interval training]], [[Olympic weightlifting]], [[plyometrics]], [[powerlifting]], [[gymnastics]] and other exercises. It is very successful around the world and has 13,000 members in affiliated [[Gym|gyms]].

Personal training is gaining more and more popularity in the Netherlands in the last 15 years. A '''personal trainer''' is a trainer certified to have a varying degree of knowledge of general fitness involved in [[exercise prescription]] and instruction. They motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback to clients. 

Obstacle training centrums are very popular in The Netherlands since companies like [[:nl:Unitedfit|UNITEDFIT]] have included the social aspect to training for an obstacle course. An '''obstacle course''' is a series of challenging physical obstacles an individual or a team need to complete while being timed. Obstacle courses can include [[running]], [[climbing]], [[jumping]], [[Crawling (human)|crawling]], [[Human swimming|swimming]], and [[Balance (ability)|balancing]] elements with the aim of testing speed and endurance. Sometimes a course involves [[Mind|mental]] tests.

===South America===
Over 60% of the population of [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]] do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity needed to maintain health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14662071|volume=14|issue=4|title=Rapid changes in lifestyle make increased physical activity a priority for the Americas|date=October 2003|vauthors=Jacoby E, Bull F, Neiman A|journal=Rev.

Salud Publica|pages=223–5, 226–8|doi=10.1590/s1020-49892003000900002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of a southern Brazilian population found that &gt;80% of the population was physically inactive.&lt;ref name="Brazil2005"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dias-da-Costa JS, Hallal PC, Wells JC, etal|title=Epidemiology of leisure-time physical activity: a population-based study in southern Brazil|journal=Cad Saude Publica|volume=21|issue=1|pages=275–82|year=2005|pmid=15692661|doi=10.1590/s0102-311x2005000100030|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
A study of Swedish males found a significant decrease in total physical exercise even though recreational exercise has increased.  This was due to a decrease in work place exercise and physical exercise in transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norman A, Bellocco R, Vaida F, Wolk A|title=Age and temporal trends of total physical activity in Swedish men|journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc|volume=35|issue=4|pages=617–22|date=April 2003|pmid=12673145|doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000058357.23080.F4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Leisure_inactivity_2007.jpg|thumb|Graph showing the trend in the proportion of the U.S. population which reported no leisure-time physical activity, 1988 - 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/physical/stats/leisure_time.htm|title=Physical Activity Statistics: No Leisure-Time Physical Activity Trend Chart &amp;#124; DNPAO &amp;#124; CDC|work=WHO|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Americans have become less [[Physical exercise|physically active]] overall between 1955 and 2005.&lt;ref name="America2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brownson RC, Boehmer TK, Luke DA|title=Declining rates of physical activity in the United States: what are the contributors?|journal=Annu Rev Public Health|volume=26|issue=1|pages=421–43|year=2005|pmid=15760296|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.26.021304.144437|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the rate of leisure-time physical activity has not changed significantly there has been a decrease in work-related activity, human powered transportation, activity in the home, and increasing [[sedentary lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=America2005/&gt;  During 2000 and 2005 the number of adults who were never physically active increased from 9.4% to 10.3% while the number who were engaged in the highest level of physical activity decreased from 18.7% to 16.7%.  Pertaining to leisure-time physical activity, people involved in no activity increased from 38.5% to 40.0% while those who spent most of their day sitting increased from 36.8% to 39.9%.&lt;ref name=CDC2007/&gt;

In 2000 the CDC estimated that more than 40% of the US population was sedentary, another 30% was active but not sufficiently and less than 30% had an adequate level of physical activity.&lt;ref name="Caballero"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caballero B|title=The global epidemic of obesity: An overview|journal=Epidemiol Rev|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–5|year=2007|pmid=17569676|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxm012|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a trend toward decreased physical activity in part due to increasingly mechanized forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.  Obesity rates have increased in relation to expanding suburbs. This has been attributed to increased time spent commuting, leading to less exercise and less meal preparation at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lopez R|title=Urban sprawl and risk for being overweight or obese|journal=Am J Public Health|year=2004|pages=1574–9|volume=94|issue=9|pmid=15333317|doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.9.1574|pmc=1448496}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time between 1983 and 1990 the number of trips taken by foot decreased from 9% down to 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=French SA, Story M, Jeffery RW|title=Environmental influences on eating and physical activity|journal=Annu Rev Public Health|volume=22|issue=1|pages=309–35|year=2001|pmid=11274524|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.309|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[School run|Driving one's children to school]] has become increasingly popular.

:''See [[Kata]] for "Form" as used in the context of martial arts.''

'''Form''' is a specific way of performing a movement, often a [[strength training]] exercise, to avoid injury, prevent [[Cheating#Strength_training|cheating]] and increase strength.

=='Proper form'==
Exercises or drills in sport have a recognized way of performing the movements that have two purposes:
===Avoiding injury===
By using proper or 'good and' form, the risk of injury is lowered. A lack of proper form commonly results in injury or a lack of effect from the exercise being performed

===Maximize benefit===
Good form ensures that the movement only uses the main muscles, and avoids recruiting secondary muscles.  As a muscle fatigues, the body attempts to compensate by recruiting other muscle groups and transferring force generation to non-fatigued units.  This reduces the benefits in strength or size gain experienced by the muscles as they are not worked to failure.

'''General strength exercises''' are the [[physical exercise]]s that are used in overall [[body conditioning]].  They are not directly related to the specific actions seen in a specific sport (i.e., strengthening the muscles as they are used in a specific sport and increasing an athlete's functional potential for improved performance).&lt;ref&gt;Yessis, Michael. ''Build A Better Athlete''. Equilibrium Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[overhead press]] exercise which is used by [[runners]] can illustrate the concept of a general strength exercise.  It is a common exercise in which the arms move directly upward overhead.  In [[running]], however, the arms move in a forward-backward motion in relation to the trunk.  Thus, the overhead press is a good exercise for [[strengthening]] the shoulders and arms, but, even though it uses some of the same [[muscles]] that are involved in running, it is not directly related to running.&lt;ref&gt;Yessis, Michael. ''Explosive Running''. Ultimate Athlete Concepts, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

If an athlete has weak shoulders this exercise can improve strength capabilities &lt;ref&gt;Zatsiorski, Vladimir and Kramer, William.  "Science and Practice of Strength Training". Human Kinetics, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which may indirectly help an athlete's arms during a run.  This exercise is not, however, as effective as an exercise in which the arm and shoulder movements duplicate the exact action (pathway) seen in running.  This is known as a specialized exercise.  An example of a specialized exercise for the shoulders is driving the arm from behind the body to in front of the body in the same pathway and in the same range of motion as seen in the running stride.

The key to improving athletic performance is to perform general exercises to develop a base and to then perform special exercises that duplicate the movements and actions seen in the actual skills execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yuri V.Verkoshansky |title=Programming and Organization of Sports training |publisher=Sportiviny Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the development of the physical abilities that are specific to any sport will have the greatest impact on maintaining or improving the athlete's ability to perform better.

Because of the need for skill duplication most exercises are best done with rubber tubing as in the Active Cords set.  The cords are especially important for the leg, hip and shoulder actions.  The reason for this is that it is very difficult and in some cases impossible, to duplicate the exact movements of the legs, hips and shoulders with [[dumbbells]], [[barbells]] or machines.  [[Medicine ball]] exercises are also used for [[Physical strength|strength]] and explosive muscular development.

It is the largest sport university in Europe with approximately  6,000 students. The German Sport University (GSU), in Cologne called SpoHo, combines qualified teaching and international research of the highest level. The University is located in the [[Cologne]] district [[Müngersdorf]], adjacent to the facilities of the major sports in Cologne, such as the [[RheinEnergieStadion]], home of the Cologne Premier League football team 1. FC Koeln. Since May 20, 2014 Heiko K. Strüder has been rector of the GSU, Chancellor has been Angelika Claßen since August 18, 2014.[[File:Luftaufnahme der Deutschen Sporthochschule Köln.jpg|thumb|Aeration of the German Sport University Cologne]]

== History ==
[[File:Studierende_auf_dem_Campus_der_Deutschen_Sporthochschule_Köln.jpg|thumb|305x305px|Campus of the German Sports University Cologne]]
The Sport University Cologne was founded in 1947 and, thus, continued the academic tradition of physical education in Germany established by Berlin’s „Deutsche Hochschule für Leibesübungen“ (German University for physical exercise) which had been inaugurated in 1920. After the Sport University had changed its name to “German Sport University” in 1965 it gained the official status as a University in 1970. From now on, it had the right to award Ph.D.s (doctor of sport sciences) as well as the postdoctoral lecture qualification (Habilitation). After German reunification, the East German “Deutsche Hochschule für Körperkultur” (German University for “body culture”) Leipzig was dissolved, leaving the Sport University Cologne as the only one of its kind in Germany.[[File:AusdauerlaufDSHS.jpg|thumb|305x305px|Endurance run of the physical aptitude test]]

In [[tennis]], a '''grip''' is a way of holding the [[racquet]] in order to hit shots during a match. The three most commonly used conventional grips are: the Continental (or "Chopper"), the Eastern and the Western. Most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting.

== The octagonal handle ==

[[File:TennisBevels-PNG.png|thumb|upright=4|Numbering of bevels on a tennis racket grip]]

In order to understand the grips, it is important to know that the handle of a racquet always consists of 8 sides or, in other words, has an [[octagon]]al shape. A square shape would hurt the hand, while a round shape would not give enough friction to gain a firm grip. The eight sides of the handle are called [[bevel]]s. We can number the bevels from 1 to 8 as follows: if the blade of the racquet is [[perpendicular]] to the ground, the bevel facing up is bevel #1. Rotating the racquet counter-clockwise (for a right handed player, clockwise for a left handed player), the next bevel facing up is bevel #2, if you are right-handed, and clockwise if you are left-handed, and so on to identify all 8 bevels.

== The grips ==

=== The Continental Grip (Bevel #2) ===

The Continental grip, also called the Chopper grip or Hammer grip, is obtained when placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger is right on bevel #2. It is naturally obtained when holding the racket as if it were an axe, hence the second name "Chopper grip". The Continental grip is suitable for a variety of shots and therefore is often taught to absolute beginners, so that they should not bother changing grips while learning the basics of the game. This type of grip is very useful for quick volleys and strokes near the net. Since modern tennis, especially clay-court tennis, has shown an evolution towards topspin, the Continental grip has gone out of fashion with professional players for hitting [[groundstroke]]s.  It is still the preferred grip for [[Serve (tennis)|serves]] and [[Volley (tennis)|volleys]]. Additionally, the grip is used for some defensive strategies, such as chipping and blocking shots. Moreover, the grip can be used offensively to hit a "drop shot", which puts extreme backward spin on the ball. The rest of the grips strike a balance between high spin capacity on the one hand, and power on the other.

===The Eastern Forehand Grip (Bevel #3) ===

The Eastern Forehand grip is obtained when placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger is right on bevel #3.  The Eastern Forehand grip allows for fast, flat shots on the forehand, with some control through topspin. Net players like it because it easily changes to the continental grip for volleys. It offers little control at high balls, and there is not enough control to sustain long rallies. It is also known as the shake hands grip.

===The Semi-Western Forehand Grip (Bevel #4) ===

The Semi-Western grip is obtained by placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger is right on bevel #4. This racquet grip is popular with baseliners who like to hit with much topspin and a ferocious amount of power. It gets more hand behind the grip, causing shots to result with more ferocity, and provides a contact point much farther out front. On the other hand, it poses problems with lower balls, which are hard to catch with the (extreme) down-up movement required for the Semi-Western grip.

===The Western Forehand Grip (Bevel #5) ===

The Western grip is obtained by placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger is right on bevel #5. This grip is used for applying extreme topspin, but is even hard to play. Low balls are extremely difficult to return.

=== The Double-Handed Forehand Grip (F: Bevel #2 + B: Bevel #6) ===

The basic Two-Handed Forehand grip, is obtained by holding the racquet in a regular Continental grip, then placing the left hand above holding it in a left-handed Semi-Western Forehand grip. This places the reference bevels of the two hands exactly opposite each other. Holding the racquet using two hands for the forehand is highly unusual, but some well-known top WTA players (e.g. [[Monica Seles]]) have used it successfully. While it shortens the forehand reach and reduces maximum power, it offers unrivalled accuracy, which may more than compensate the former drawbacks. Also, combined with a two-handed backhand, it is almost impossible for the opponent to see which side (backhand or forehand) is hitting the ball. The sides often are equally accurate, and no grip change is required.

=== The Eastern Backhand Grip (Bevel #1)  ===

The Eastern Backhand grip is obtained when placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger and heel of the hand are right on bevel #1. This grip allows for significant spin and control. The opposite face of the racket is used compared to the Eastern forehand. For someone who uses a Western forehand grip, on the other hand, the same face of the racket as in the forehand is used to strike the ball; no need to change grips if the forehand is played with a Western grip.

=== The Semi-Western Backhand grip (Bevel #8) ===

The Semi-Western backhand grip, is used by placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger is right on bevel #8. Compared to the Continental grip, the blade has rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This forces the wrist in an uncomfortable twist but allows for the greatest possible spin.

This is basically equivalent to the Semi-Western forehand grip. The same face of the racquet as in the forehand is used to strike the ball. No need to change grips if the forehand is played with a Semi-Western grip.

=== The Double-Handed Backhand Grip (F: Bevel #2 + B: Bevel #6) ===

The basic Two-Handed Backhand grip is obtained by holding the racquet in a regular Continental grip, then placing the left hand above holding it in a left-handed Semi-Western Forehand grip. This places the reference bevels of the two hands exactly opposite each other. Holding the racquet using two hands for the backhand is very common, but there are many variations in the precise positioning of the two hands. This also varies between right- and left-handed players.

A different face of the racquet than in the forehand is used to strike the ball.

== The evolution of forehand grips ==

For a number of years during the first two decades of the 20th century the small, frail player [[Bill Johnston (tennis)|Bill Johnston]] was considered by many {{Weasel inline|date=August 2010}} to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a Western grip. Few top players used the Western grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the Western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. With the changes in technology, the various grips have come to be used very differently from previously. First, the Continental grip is used primarily to serve and to volley, not to hit forehand shots, or a backhand slice. The eastern grip is still used, though far less than in the past, and is used to hit very flat shots. It is excellent to hit low passing shots. The most popular grip on the tour is the Semi-Western grip. It gives a nice mix of spin and pace on the forehand, and offers ease to transition to the backhand grip. Finally the Western grip (and its extreme variations), are some of the most radical grips used on the tour, mostly by clay-courters, and are used to create massive amounts of topspin.

== The evolution of backhand grips==

The backhand can be executed with either one or both hands. {{asof|2014}} three of the top 100 ranked women used a one-handed grip. Twenty-four of the top 100 ranked men used a one-handed grip, down from almost 50 a decade earlier.&lt;ref name="steinberger20140824"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/magazine/the-death-of-the-one-handed-backhand.html |title=The Death of the One-Handed Backhand |last=Steinberger |first=Michael |date=2014-08-24 |work=The New York Times Magazine |access-date=2018-07-25 |page=MM40 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of the 20th century the backhand was performed with one hand, using either a backhand Eastern or Continental grip. In modern tennis, there are a few professional players who use a Western one-hand backhand. This shot is held in a similar manner to the Eastern forehand. It has much more [[topspin]] potential than the traditional Eastern one-hander. The Western one-handed backhand grip makes it easier for a one-handed player to hit balls at shoulder height, but harder to hit low balls, and vice versa for the eastern one-handed backhand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  The eastern one-handed backhand and its variants are used by most pros with strong single-handed backhand drives, like [[Gustavo Kuerten]], especially [[Richard Gasquet]] among the men, and [[Justine Henin]] among the women.

The two-handed backhand is most commonly used with the forehand hand holding the racquet with a Continental grip and the non-dominant hand holding the racquet with a Semi-western forehand grip. While this is by far the most common way to hit a two-handed backhand, there are players who use different ways of holding the racquet for a two-handed backhand.

The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, [[Don Budge]], had a very powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted [[topspin]] onto the ball. [[Ken Rosewall]], a one-handed backhand, used a tremendously accurate slice backhand with underspin through the 1950s and 1960s. The one-handed backhand slice is often used in rallies as it is a comfortable shot. [[Andre Agassi]] in particular increased his use of the one-handed backhand and often hit an unreturnable dropshot with it.

== Grips used for serving ==
The grip for the [[serve (tennis)|serve]] depends on the [[serve (tennis)#Types of serve|type of serve]]. At professional levels, the top spin serve is hit with an Eastern backhand grip (bevel #1). The server stands at an angle to the baseline, so that they can turn during the service and make contact with the racquet squarely on the ball.

At professional levels, the slice serve is most commonly hit with a Continental grip (bevel #2). The server tosses the ball a little to the right of his body (if they are right-handed) and cuts the ball at the side to impart spin. For a right-hander, the slice serve curves to the left, and is useful in pulling the opponent out wide, or serving into his body. Many players, however, use an Eastern backhand grip (bevel #1) for their spin serves; this gives the racquet even more angle as it sweeps across the ball.

There are three types of kick (topspin) serves; the pure [[Serve (tennis)#Topspin serve|topspin serve]], the topspin-slice serve, and the [[Serve (tennis)#American Twist/Twist serve|twist serve]]. For most, the topspin serve is hit by using an Eastern backhand grip (bevel #1) and the ball is thrown so that if it were to drop, it would land on the server's heel or head. In the topspin serve, the racquet brushes up the backside of the ball to impart topspin. In the topspin-slice or kick serve, the racquet is held with an Eastern backhand or Continental grip. The topspin-slice serve has both topspin and [[slice (tennis)|slice]], and, when hit correctly, bounces in the opposite direction from the slice serve. An extreme serve requiring flexibility and a strong back, the American twist, is where one tosses the ball usually very far off to the left (for right-handed players) and imparts spin going the opposite direction of a topspin-slice serve. All of these serves are used to make an effective serve that nevertheless has a high safety factor because they clear the net with a relatively high margin of space and use the topspin to pull the ball down into the service box.

'''Gym floor covers''' can either be a carpet-based protection system or is a large plastic [[tarpaulin|tarp]], similar to a painters tarp, usually divided into equal sections {{convert|6|to|10|ft}} wide each to cover up the entire [[gym]] floor. Gym floor covers are available in roll or tile systems.These covers are often used in large venues designed for athletic events when non-athletic events are being held there such as receptions, award ceremonies, indoor track meets, gymnastic events and graduations.  

==History==
Gym floor covers are employed to prevent floor damage and improve safety, allowing for sports venues to be used for other purposes. Covers are used to prevent [[slip and fall]] accidents, while protecting underlying hardwood floor from foot traffic damage and heavy furniture scratches and dents. The newer carpet topcloth systems also improve acoustics in the gymnsium.

The first plastic tarp gym floor cover was invented and manufactured by Covermaster Inc. in 1969 with  Seattle-based Floor Guardian Inc.{{cn|date=October 2014}} following up by manufacturing a recycled content, removable, portable carpet based protection system in the late 1970s to answer the demand for a product that was less of a trip hazard, environmentally sound and classier looking than what many felt was essentially a painter's tarp. Since then, the quality of the materials has greatly evolved. Most manufacturers have switched from vinyl and [[polyethylene]] materials to more durable [[polyester]] fabric. In 2013, Protex Matting Inc. answered environmental concerns by introducing the newest 100% recycled polyester top cloth gym floor covers made completely from recycled plastic water bottles, reusing approximately 7000 water bottles for every 10,000 sq. ft produced {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The best plastic tarp gym floor covers today are made of single-layer woven polyester and the newest [[polymer]] materials made via the knife-coating process, which enables dyes to be deposited deep into the core of the [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. material and prevent peeling of the layers - a side effect of [[extrusion]] coating or [[lamination]] process.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:Gym floor cover comparison.jpg|frame|'''Gym floor cover texture comparison:''' &lt;br /&gt;polyester double-sided cover vs. vinyl single-sided gym floor cover]] --&gt;.

Modern gym floor covers are manufactured with a variety of colors, anti-slip surfaces, and weights ranging from {{convert|6|to|32|oz/sqyd}}. Custom sizing is available with most products. The following technical characteristics are used to describe and classify the covers: filament size, weave count, total weight, core weight, tear strength, tensile strength, [[adhesion]], [[coefficient of friction]], slip resistance, [[hydrostatic]] resistance, fire resistance and others.

==Usage==

There are several common ways to install floor coverings. For the tarp method, each section is laid down to slightly overlap adjacent sections and then secured with special adhesive tape. This fastens the individual segments together into a cohesive unit. The carpet method, by contrast, affixes the segments to the floor via reusable velcro straps. Newer tile systems allow more flexibility in installation and do not require adhesive or velcro tape, but are much more labor intensive for larger floors.

Installing and deploying large covers can be labour-intensive task. The most efficient way involves rolling and unrolling each section separately, and storing them on the gym floor cover storage system (rack) in a rolled up state to prevent creases and dust accumulation. Advances in the newer Protex GymPro products allow for smaller storage racks, while the newer tile systems are stacked on compact platform trucks for storage and transport. Dual cleaning brush assemblies (to remove debris) and electric power winders (to reduce manual labor during cover removal) are normally used to efficiently maintain the covers. Carpet based gym covers are best cleaned using more traditional carpet cleaning techniques.

Plastic tarp gym floor covers have a typical lifetime of 10–15 years. Carpet-based covers have a lifetime of 15–20+ years.

[[File:Kickboards Jahrhunderthalle Probe Zauberflöte 04-09-03.JPG|thumb|Two-wheeled, three-wheeled and four-wheeled scooters which appeared around 2000.]]
A '''kick scooter''', '''push scooter''' or '''scooter''' is a [[human-powered land vehicle]] with a handlebar, deck and [[wheel]]s that is propelled by a rider pushing off the ground. The most common scooters today are made of aluminum, titanium and steel. Some kick scooters that are made for younger children have 3 or 4 wheels and are made of [[plastic]] or do not fold. High-performance racing scooters made for adults resemble the old "[[penny-farthing]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/kick-|title=Kick dictionary definition - kick defined|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motorized scooter]]s, historically powered by [[Internal combustion engine|gas engines]], and more recently [[electric motor]]s, are self-propelled kick scooters capable of speeds of around {{cvt|30|kph}}.

==Models and history==

===Early scooters===
[[File:Antique scooter 3551872006 2bb76c7e88 z.jpg|thumb|Wooden scooter with a pair of roller skates]]
Kick scooters have been handmade in industrial urban areas in Europe and the U.S. for at least 100 years, often as play items made for children to roam the streets.&lt;ref&gt;There is a scene of this in Fritz Lang's [[M (1931 film)|1931 classic ''M'']].&lt;/ref&gt; One common home-made version is made by attaching [[roller skate]] wheel sets to a board with some kind of handle, usually an old box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crazyskateboardinggames.com/tag/skateboarding|title=Skateboarding - Skateboarding Games|website=crazyskateboardinggames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=October 2018}} One can lean to turn, or by a second board connected by a crude pivot.  The construction was all wood, with 3–4&amp;nbsp;inch (75–100&amp;nbsp;mm) wheels with steel [[ball bearings]].  An additional advantage of this construction was loud noise, just like from a "real" vehicle. An alternative construction consists of one steel clamp&amp;ndash;on roller skate divided into front and rear parts and attached to a wood beam.

A search of the German ''Bundesarchiv'' for "roller" reveals both homemade and manufactured childrens' scooters used and even raced in Paris, Berlin and Leipzig in 1930, 1948 and 1951. They are similar to modern designs.

=== Honda Kick 'n Go ===
In 1974, the [[Honda]] company made the Kick 'n Go, a scooter driven by a pedal on a lever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hondaroots.com/2015/01/21/honda-kick-n-go-scooter/|title=Honda Kick-n-Go Scooter|website=Honda Kick-n-Go Scooter}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it seemed to be as much effort to "kick" as a regular scooter, the novelty of it caught on and it became popular nevertheless.

=== Pneumatic tires ===
Before [[bicycle]]s became popular among children, [[steel]] scooters with two small [[bicycle wheel]]s had been the most useful vehicles for them. Around 1987, many [[BMX]] manufacturers produced BMX-like scooters as Scoot.&lt;ref&gt;[[GT Bicycles|GT]] [http://bmxmuseum.com/bikes/gt_bicycles/28678 Zoot Scoot], [[Mongoose (bicycles)|Mongoose]] [http://bmxmuseum.com/bikes/mongoose/37154 Pro Miniscoot], SE Racing [http://bmxmuseum.com/bikes/se_racing/2076 Rad Scoot], and more.&lt;/ref&gt; Those manufacturers discontinued their scooters, but some scooter manufacturers were established after years, and still develop similar scooters today; Some are used in dense urban areas for utility purposes, being faster than a folding scooter and more convenient than a [[utility bicycle]]. Some are made for off-road use and are described as Mountain Scooters. Besides commuting, sports competition and off-road use, large wheel scooters are a favorite for [[dog scootering]] where single or team dogs such as [[Husky|huskies]] pull a scooter and rider in the same way that a sled is pulled across snow. Some [[Amish]] are not allowed to ride bicycles, so they ride scooters instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amishamerica.com/how-do-amish-travel/|title=How do Amish travel?|website=amishamerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today variations on the [[kicksled]] with scooter design features are also available, such as the Kickspark.

The development of the kickbike in Finland in 1994 changed the way scooters are viewed.{{cn|date=October 2018}}  The Kickbike has a large standard size bicycle front wheel and a much smaller rear wheel, allowing a much faster ride. The Footbike Eurocup has been held since 2001. Kickbike America is bringing the sport of dryland mushing to America. The Kickbike is regarded as the leading dog scooter in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iksaworld.com/frame-eurocup-raceresults-2001.html |year=2001 |title=Eurocup race results |publisher=IKSA world |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713005824/http://www.iksaworld.com/frame-eurocup-raceresults-2001.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folding scooters ===
[[File:Ridescooter.theora.ogv|thumb|Children on scooters]]
In 1996, a foldable [[aluminium]] scooter with [[inline skates]] wheels was created by Wim Ouboter of [[Micro Mobility Systems]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WeFf86-e7A|title=The Micro Scooter History|date=15 December 2011|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/mar/31/features.magazine137 | publisher = The Guardian | title = Inventor of the micro scooter | date = 2002-03-31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{bcn|date=December 2017}} The scooter was sold as "Micro Skate Scooter", "[[Razor (scooter)|Razor]]" and "[[JDBUG]]/JDRAZOR MS-130A".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.razor.co.jp/item.php?action=dt&amp;no=10010&amp;category=1 |title=JDRAZOR MS-130A |publisher=JD Japan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831235000/http://www.razor.co.jp/item.php?action=dt&amp;no=10010&amp;category=1 |archivedate=2010-08-31 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Razor was introduced to Japan in 1999, many young people in [[Tokyo]] began to use it as a portable transporter then it became a fad around the world, and such small scooters also became popular toys for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osdir.com/ml/culture.bicycle.birdybike.general/2000-05/msg00015.html|title=culture.bicycle.birdybike.general - Folding Scooter Story - msg#00015 - Recent Discussion OSDir.com|website=osdir.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320000400/http://osdir.com/ml/culture.bicycle.birdybike.general/2000-05/msg00015.html|archivedate=2012-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro scooters ===
[[File:Stunt Scooter.jpg|thumb|Children on stunt scooters]]
Kick scooters used for [[extreme sport]] stunts and tricks, and made to withstand these kinds of stresses, are called pro scooters.  Numerous brands specialize in stunt scooters and accessories such as helmets, pegs, grind wax, griptape clamps, and clothing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Large folding scooters ====
Folding kick scooters optimized for adults generally have more durable parts and are designed with wider&lt;!--and longer,soft--&gt; decks, hand brake, and larger wheels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Using Bicycles | url = http://usingbicycles.blogspot.com/2008/03/xootr-bicycle-for-ultra-minimalist.html | title = Xootr bicycle for ultra minimalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=October 2018}} for smoother transportation instead of less weight and portability.

=== Three wheels ===
{{unreferenced section | date=January 2016}}
[[File:Kickboard 208640310 fcd4f3ff29 z.jpg|thumb|A three-wheeled K2 Kickboard]]
Three-wheeled scooters like [[tricycle]]s have been produced for little children.

In 1999, Micro Mobility Systems and [[K2 Sports]] produced a reverse-three-wheeled scooter as "Kickboard". Micro also produced the Kickboard-like children's scooters as "Mini Micro" and "Maxi Micro". The reverse design inherently provides greater stability than the standard: a standing person will tend to stand at the front of a scooter rather than at the back. However, the steering geometry is inherently weak and requires design adaptation to improve its response. An example is the Mini Micro, which uses a spring-loaded system to translate lateral force on the handbars (child leaning) into turning motion on the wheels, referred by its makers as "lean and steer".

=== Four wheels ===
[[File:Four-wheeled scooter on the street.jpg|thumb|A Fuzion-like scooter]]
The early scooters, which were made with roller skates, were four-wheeled like [[skateboard]]s.

Around 2000, A Swiss company produced a four-wheeled scooter as "Wetzer Stickboard". The Stickboard was a narrow skateboard with a foldable pole on the nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgooddesign.net/e/awards/reddot/0013-body.html|title=WGD /WGD Awards /red dot award|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a company called Nextsport started producing a line of four-wheeled scooters, known as Fuzions.  Fuzion scooters are typically bigger and heavier than Razor and Micro models.  The early Fuzion models come with large, wide wheels, and an oversized deck for carving stability.  Later scooters, such as the Fuzion NX, include smaller, harder wheels, and 360 degree handlebar spinning capabilities, unlike its predecessors. 

== Comparison ==
[[File:Scooter and bike 3571177185 201c87cb5e z.jpg|thumb|A folding scooter and a [[utility bicycle]]]]
Unlike a kick scooter, a bicycle has a seat and drive train, which add speed, cost, weight and bulk. A folding scooter can be more easily carried than a [[folding bicycle]] or even a [[portable bicycle]].  Even a non-folding scooter is easier to manoeuvre between obstacles, as there are no protruding pedals. Thus a cyclist has advantages in longer journeys and open spaces, and a kick scooter in shorter and more crowded ones. Kick scooters seldom have a luggage rack, so the rider usually carries any cargo on their back.

At low speeds a bicycle is difficult to control while pedalling, which is why cyclists occasionally kick their way through dense traffic or in other conditions where they cannot take advantage of the speed of their machine. Thanks to the superior low-speed stability of a kick scooter, it is allowed on many footpaths where riding a bicycle is forbidden.

Since the feet are nearer the ground on a scooter, it is easier to step on and off than even a [[step-through frame]] bicycle, hence the rider can alternate walking and pushing as energy and route dictate. Large wheel scooters afford a more effective [[cross training]] workout than standard bicycles as the whole body is engaged in the effort of kicking. Although the bicycle is a much more effective and efficient long distance machine, in 2001 Jim Delzer propelled a kick scooter across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suewidemark.com/delzer.htm|title=Delzer first to cross US on a kickbike|website=suewidemark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the league issued the following charter entitled "''What We Stand For''":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/frames/fulldesc?inst_id=73&amp;coll_id=7242 Archives in London and the M25 area] Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070921101218/http://league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1539 Original declaration of principles] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Our Principle''':  That it is iniquitous to inflict suffering, either directly or indirectly, upon sentient animals for the purpose of Sport.
*'''We Condemn''': [[fox hunting|Fox-hunting]], [[otter]]-hunting, [[deer hunting|stag-hunting]], [[beagling|hare-hunting]] and [[coursing|rabbit]] and [[hare coursing|hare-coursing]], because they are organized forms of [[cruelty to animals|cruelty]] for pleasure, and, therefore, prejudicial to the best interests of the State.
*'''We Support and Recommend''': All clean humane forms of Sport, such as [[football (soccer)|football]], [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[running]], [[human swimming|swimming]], [[scouting]], [[hill-climbing]], etc., etc.
*'''We Specially Recommend''': [[Drag hunting]] as a substitute to hunting animals and we appeal to Hunts to adopt it.  Also "hunting" Big Game with the Camera as Major Dugmore and others do.
*'''Blooding Children''': We protest against the insult offered in hunting circles, not only to the child-life of the nation but to the community in general, by smearing children's cheeks with blood from the brush or pads of a [[fox]] or other animal hunted to death, and we demand the cessation of this demoralizing custom.
We respectfully invite Religious, [[Education]], [[Social Welfare]], [[Humanitarian]] and any other allied bodies willing to participate, by passing resolutions towards this end, to co-operate with us to make our demand effective.

==Key campaigns==

===Hunting===
Despite the passing of the [[Hunting Act 2004|Hunting Act]] in 2004, there is still a very strong pro-hunt lobby which seeks to have the Hunting Act repealed. The league campaigns to ensure that the Hunting Act is preserved. The league’s ‘Keep Cruelty History’ campaign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepcrueltyhistory.com/home/|title="Keep Cruelty History website"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in September 2009 and focused on highlighting the position on the finding of local candidates at the following year's [[general election]].
The league runs a Wildlife Crimewatch service through which members of the public can report any suspicious activity which may be in breach of the Hunting Act or any other wildlife legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content/687/Report-a-crime|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the public call the Wildlife Crimewatch line several times a day to report suspicious behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/news_detail.aspx?ID=48|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information is logged and passed on to police where appropriate. The league also coordinates a network of volunteers who monitor and record the activities of hunts.

===Snaring===
[[Snare trap|Snares]] are thin wire hitches used to catch and choke the animal. The snares are set to trap any animal perceived to be a pest or threat. The design of a snare &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/snares_and_snaring.html|title="Types of snare"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210155/http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/snares_and_snaring.html|archivedate=22 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that it may [[strangle]] its victim and can lead to extreme pain and suffering, or cause the animal to die instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/assets/files/The_Case_for_a_Ban_on_Snares.pdf|title="The Case for a Ban on Snares by the National Federation of Badger Groups" p6|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916142413/http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/assets/files/The_Case_for_a_Ban_on_Snares.pdf|archivedate=16 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commonly used by gamekeepers to catch [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s and [[stoat]]s, many protected [[mammal]]s such as [[badger]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/news_wire/badger_cub_found_in_snare.html|title="Badger cub found in snare"|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[otter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/4511053.stm|title=BBC NEWS - England - Cornwall - Otter in 'terrible' snare death|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  plus [[livestock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishspca.org/assets/0000/2593/Snaring_in_Scotland.pdf|title="Snaring in Scotland: A Scottish SPCA Survey of Suffering" p2-3|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617110400/http://www.scottishspca.org/assets/0000/2593/Snaring_in_Scotland.pdf|archivedate=17 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[pet|domestic pets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisnaring.org.uk/news_wire/cat_maimed_in_illegal_trap.html|title="Cat maimed in illegal trap"|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are either caught, seriously injured or killed in snares. Despite being banned in most countries across [[Europe]], snaring is still legal in the [[United Kingdom]]. The League Against Cruel Sports believes that snaring is cruel, indiscriminate, and wholly unnecessary and calls for an end to the manufacture, sale and use of snares in the UK.

===Dog fighting===
Despite being made illegal in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1835, [[dog fighting]] has been gaining ground in some communities in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspca.org.uk/servlet/Satellite?blobcol=urlblob&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=RSPCABlob&amp;blobwhere=1236788694832&amp;ssbinary=true "New RSPCA Figures Show Shocking Rise In Dog Fighting On Our Streets"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are trained to be [[violent]] by being starved and beaten. Those that seem too weak or fail to show enough aggression are killed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/dog-fighting/dog-fighting-faq.html ASPCA Dog Fighting FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; If a dog they use for fighting does not die from their wounds, losing dogs may be [[electrocuted]], [[drowned]], or [[hanged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/6962563.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Programmes - Panorama - Dog-Fighting Undercover|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The league campaigns to raise awareness of the prevalence of dog fighting in the UK. In April 2010, the league launched a new telephone line through which members of the public can report suspicious incidents that they think might be related to fighting dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=299|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shooting===
Millions of [[game birds]] are shot every year. Over 35 million [[pheasants]] and 6.5 million [[partridges]] are reared for shooting in the UK each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/gamedrain.pdf"The|title=Game Drain, Animal Aid report" p2|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These birds are often reared in [[battery cage]]s, according to the league’s website. The league's website also states "the misery doesn't end there - all kinds of wildlife suffer at the hands of the shoot, in the name of predator control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.aspx?CategoryID=300|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/kfps.pdf|title=Robinson, Peter: "Pheasant Shooting in Britain: The Sport and the Industry in the 21st Century" p9|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112173009/http://animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/kfps.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league campaigns for the shooting industry to be brought within the scope of the animal Welfare Act. It also conducts investigations to highlight what it alleges is cruelty within the industry and highlights concerns about teaching children to kill for sport and recreation.

===Bullfighting===
The League Against Cruel Sports seeks a complete end to [[bullfighting]] anywhere in the world and [[Lobbying|lobbies]] regional and local [[governments]] to put an end to bullfighting internationally. The league discourages [[big business]]es from associating with or sponsoring bullfighting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=337|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally raises awareness of the cruelty and suffering involved in bullfighting. The league also promotes the Worldwide Anti-Bullfighting Pledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=122&amp;ea.campaign.id=3429|title=League Against Cruel Sports|website=e-activist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which signatories pledge never to visit a bullfight anywhere in the world.

===Racing animals===
The League is now opposed to [[greyhound racing]] as it believes there is a much darker side to this sport, and attempts to regulate it to minimise cruelty have failed. Thousands of [[greyhounds]] go missing every year, many put down, others dispatched with a [[bullet]] to the head or a brick around the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sighthounds.org.uk/updocs/RacingGreyhounds_WorkingLurchers_Wales.pdf|title=Sighthound Welfare Trust - Working towards the end of abuse, neglect and exploitation suffered by sighthounds|website=www.sighthounds.org.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531214136/http://www.sighthounds.org.uk/updocs/RacingGreyhounds_WorkingLurchers_Wales.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league has campaigned for a number of changes such as; independent regulation of the greyhound racing industry; the set-up of one single regulatory authority tasked with establishing and enforcing welfare rules; and a compulsory [[Tax|levy]] from bookmakers to fund welfare improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=344|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the league is calling for a phasing out of greyhound racing.

===Trophy hunting===
[[Trophy hunting]] is the stalking and killing of wild animals for sport. The league says this multimillion-pound international industry is causing an irreversible decline in some of the world's most [[threatened species]] and campaigns to see it abolished. The league focuses on exposing British travel companies who promote trophy hunting. The league has also conducted numerous investigations into trophy hunting around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=342|title=League Against Cruel Sports - The Page You Request Does Not Exist|website=League Against Cruel Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
*'''1923''' – The league began in [[Morden]], (now a suburb of [[London]]) after Henry Amos raised a protest against rabbit [[coursing]]; he was successful in motivating support and managed to achieve a ban. This encouraged him to organise opposition to other forms of [[blood sport]]s and so, along with Ernest Bell, he established the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports. Although many blood sports such as [[Bull-baiting|bull]], [[Bear-baiting|bear]] and [[badger baiting]] and [[cock fighting]] had already been outlawed at the time, animal protection laws only applied to domestic and captive animals. With the [[RSPCA]] unwilling to take action against hunting, Amos and Bell identified a clear need for an organisation which would campaign against what it classified as cruel sports.
*'''1927''' – The organisation had 1000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175638/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1636 ''1927: The League had 1000 members''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 28/09/07&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1932''' – Bell left the organisation due to a difference in tactics. He went on to found the National Society for the Abolition of Cruel Sports (NSACS).
*'''1948''' – Actress [[Yvonne Arnaud]] became the league's president until 1951.&lt;ref name = "Developing Campaigns"/&gt;
*'''1960''' – League patron, [[Sir Patrick Moore]], introduced an anti-hunting motion to the [[RSPCA]]'s AGM but it was defeated.&lt;ref name="Developing Campaigns"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175311/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1637 ''Developing Campaigns''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 29/09/07&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1967''' – [[Donald Soper|Reverend Lord Donald Soper]] became president of the league, a position held for 30 years, until his death in 1997.
*'''1975''' – An anti-[[hare coursing]] Bill, supported by the league, passed through the House of Commons, but failed in the House of Lords.
*'''1978''' – The league helped establish legal protection for [[otter]]s, which numbers were declining, by making it illegal to kill them.
*'''1989''' – As part of a "Safe Setts" campaign, the league joined forces with the [[RSPCA]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Royal Society for Nature Conservation|RSNC]] and [[Badger Trust|NFBG]] to push for further protection for [[badgers]]. The previous legislation covered the actual animals, but not the setts, which were said to be still being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175434/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1638 ''Legislative Victories''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999 the league appointed Douglas Batchelor as chief executive, with a mandate to modernize the organisation and achieve the long sought after legislation on hunting and coursing for sport. 
Douglas Bachelor's background was in farms and estate management, business consultancy and IT systems and services for agriculture. The League Committee decision to bring in rural issue and countryside management experience to the campaign proved crucial in the run up to the eventual passage of legislation on hunting and coursing in Scotland and in England and wales.

The league worked with the SSPCA (the Scottish Society for the Protection of animals) in Scotland together with IFAW, (the International Fund for Animal welfare) on assisting MSPs to bring forward a Private Members Bill banning hunting and Coursing in Scotland for sport. The bill became an Act in 2002.

The league worked with the RSPCA (the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals) and with IFAW in England and Wales to help secure the passage of the Hunting Act through Parliament in 2004. The campaign was contested throughout by the Countryside Alliance and the Middle way Group who challenged it at every opportunity in Parliament, in the House of Lords and in Court, losing on each occasion.

*'''2005''' – With the commencement of the [[Hunting Act 2004|Hunting Act]], [[hare coursing]], [[fox hunting]], [[deer hunting]], and hare hunting with dogs became illegal in England and Wales.  "We are delighted that 80 years of peaceful, legal campaigning has paid off and that hunters will not be permitted to inflict suffering on wild mammals for their entertainment," a spokesman for the League Against Cruel Sports told BBC News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4275753.stm ''Ban on hunting comes into force''] [[BBC]], Retrieved 05/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2006''' – A huntsman with the Exmoor Foxhounds, was found guilty of illegal hunting foxes with dogs in a [[private prosecution]] taken out by the league. (In 2009, the huntsman's appeal was upheld by the High Court, and the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to contest that ruling.) The league continued to monitor hunts so that evidence of law breaking could be brought before the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/5245458.stm ''Huntsman guilty of breaking ban''] [[BBC]].

*'''2009''' – announced a new campaign against dog fighting, amidst news reports that there is an increase in dog fighting in London.
*'''2010''' – the league rebrands and launches a new image and new logo "to better equip [it] for the campaigning challenges ahead."
*'''2011''' - Joe Duckworth was appointed chief executive following Douglas Batchelor's retirement. Joe, who has a long and distinguished background in public services, was appointed through an open recruitment and selection process.
*'''2014''' The league celebrates 90 years of campaigning against cruelty to animals in the name of sport.

*'''2015''' Rachel Newman is appointed interim chief executive, following Mr Duckworth's resignation after 4 years. Ms Newman, a lawyer by profession, has been with the League for 9 years and was formerly a solicitor &amp; Head of Prosecutions at the RSPCA for 13 years.
*The league appointed Climate Group Internal Communications Director Eduardo Gonçalves as chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.league.org.uk/news-and-opinion/press-releases/2016/jan/new-chief-executive-eduardo-goncalves-joins-league|title=New era for League Against Cruel Sports as CEO Eduardo Gonçalves takes the helm - League Against Cruel Sports|website=www.league.org.uk|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonçalves has over 20 years’ experience in communications for a number of government agencies and NGOs around the world.

==Sanctuaries==
The league began buying land in 1959 to provide a [[Nature reserve|safe haven]] for hunted animals. Concentrated around [[Exmoor]] and the [[Quantock Hills]] in the West Country, the league at one time owned around 40 wildlife reserves, the first of which it set up at Baronsdown, near [[Dulverton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112221256/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1618 ''League Sanctuaries''] League Against Cruel Sports, Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, they faced accusations by hunt supporters and the British Deer Society of poor practice in [[wildlife management]].&lt;ref name="BDS report"/&gt; A league spokesman said: "With its close links to field sports organizations, it comes as no surprise to the League that the BDS has chosen at the behest of its members to attack an organization that does not support their principle of management by killing."&lt;ref name = "BDS report"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/12/01/ndeer01.xml ''Deer society presses for inquiry into sanctuary''] Telegraph, Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the league conceded that some of the Baronsdown [[red deer|deer]] were infected with [[bovine tuberculosis]] and agreed to stop feeding the deer herd in winter to decrease overall numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1720027.ece ''Stag stabbed to death at deer sanctuary''] The Times, Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activities==
The league supported the [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002|Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act]], passed in 2002 by the [[Scottish Parliament]], and the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. Both laws make it illegal to chase a mammal with more than two dogs, but allow the use of two dogs (England) or a pack of dogs (Scotland) to flush an animal out of its lair to be shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/20006--a.htm#3 ''Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002''] HMSO, Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws allow the use of one terrier at a time below ground to flush a fox to be shot, if the owner of the terrier has written permission from the land owner or occupier to reduce fox populations in order to prevent or reducing serious damage to game birds or wild birds being kept on the land. The Hunting Act requires that the terrier is fitted with an electronic locator collar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basc.org.uk/media/terrier_code_final_form.pdf ''Code of practice for hunting with dogs below ground''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927165950/http://www.basc.org.uk/media/terrier_code_final_form.pdf |date=27 September 2006 }} Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;

The league is currently campaigning against [[factory farming|commercial breeding]] of non-native [[pheasants|game birds]] for [[sport shooting|shooting]], and against hunts that it believes are continuing to hunt wild mammals contrary to the 2004 ban.

It also campaigns to extend [[hunting legislation]] from Scotland, England and Wales to [[Northern Ireland]]. Between 2006 and 2008, it successfully undertook private prosecutions against four hunt officials under the Hunting Act, because the police would not take action, and argued that this showed that the Hunting Act was clear in its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/hunt/Story/0,,1837783,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1 ''Rethink ahead as huntsman is fined for breaking ban''] The Guardian, Retrieved 29/09/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6729983.stm ''Pair guilty of hunting with dogs''] [[BBC]], Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westpress.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=146238&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=146064&amp;contentPK=19479691&amp;folderPk=100268&amp;pNodeId=145795 ''Guilty plea after hunt pair do a deal with the League'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Western Daily Press, Retrieved 28/03/08&lt;/ref&gt; The first prosecution led to a conviction, but this was overturned on appeal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/7121482.stm ''Huntsman conviction appeal upheld''] [[BBC]], Retrieved 13/03/08&lt;/ref&gt; and the second conviction was upheld in the Crown Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6729983.stm ''Hunting duo appeal is turned down''] [[BBC]], Retrieved 02/11/07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In the late 1980s, the league's executive director, Richard Course, was fired from the league after he expressed views divergent from the league's mission.  He had begun to spend some time with the mounted fox hunts as an outgrowth of his work. After a period of time talking with professional wildlife managers and hunt supporters, he concluded that: "I find it repugnant that some people will kill another living creature for recreational purposes" but said that the dogs easily outpace the fox within a minute or two and kill it within a second or two and that how the fox is located is "totally irrelevant" to animal welfare considerations. Richard Course has since denied that he supported hunting as a humane method of culling foxes. James Barrington, an ex-hunt saboteur, then assumed Course's position within the league.  Barrington later resigned, stating that he concluded that an absolute ban on hunting was not in the best interests of animal welfare; he later joined the [[Countryside Alliance]] as an animal welfare consultant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countryside-alliance.org.uk/hunting-campaigns/hunting-events/ex-anti%11hunt-chief-joins-alliance/ Ex anti-hunt chief joins Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220065504/http://www.countryside-alliance.org.uk/hunting-campaigns/hunting-events/ex-anti%11hunt-chief-joins-alliance/ |date=20 February 2009 }} Countryside Alliance, Retrieved 09/03/09&lt;/ref&gt; Barrington admits that he did not fully understand hunting and therefore could not fully condemn it.

==Political links==

The league as a charity is [[Political neutrality|politically neutral]]. Complaints from opponents attacking the league's neutrality have all been dismissed by the [[Charity Commission]]. Several League staff have previously had political links. Former Chief Executive Joe Duckworth is a former trade union leader. Former CEO Douglas Batchelor was at one  time a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]].  Labour member and ex hunt saboteur [[Chris Williamson (politician)|Chris Williamson]] is a member of the board of trustees [https://web.archive.org/web/20131007031330/http://www.league.org.uk/content/347/Board-of-Trustees League Against Cruel Sports (2013) Board of Trustees], whilst several other board members are [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members. Lorraine Platt, organizer of 'Conservatives Against Fox Hunting', is a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Vice-Presidents include Labour politicians [[Robert Evans (London politician)|Robert Evans]] and [[Kerry McCarthy]].

The '''military sports''' are sport mainly practiced by the [[military]], the subject of international competitions, with an objective relates to the [[physical training]] of military, preparation for [[combat]], skill, toughness, the development of physical qualities of the [[warfighter]] and improve the professional proficiency based on the different areas of the military action: land, sea and air.

==History==
Since the founding of the [[International Military Sports Council]] (IMSC; or ''Conseil International du Sport Militaire'' (CISM)) in 1948, was purpose of this organization structure a body of evidence that adapt and serve as training for the different branches of the [[armed forces]].

[[File:NASCAR_logo_2017.svg|thumbnail|NASCAR logo]]

The '''National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing''' ('''NASCAR''') makes and enforces numerous rules and regulations that transcend all racing series.

[[NASCAR]] issues a different rule book for each racing series; however, rule books are published exclusively for NASCAR members and are not made available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/guides/customer_service/nascar_contact.html NASCAR.com] FAQ/Customer service Retrieved 1/29/07&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of the rules, such as the scoring system, have been widely publicized both by NASCAR and the media.

==Car livery==
Each car is required to display its number on each door of the car and on its roof. The front of the car and bottom of the rear bumper are required to match the decal specifications of the car manufacturer. Each car is required to display a series of around 30 NASCAR sponsor decals just to the left of each door and on the front fenders. These [[Contingency sponsorship|contingency decals]] represent series sponsors and bonus money teams are eligible to earn during the race, but may be omitted in the event in which they conflict with the team's sponsors or moral beliefs.&lt;ref name="ESPN-Contingency-20083"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/icons/news/story?id=3315850|title=Contingency stickers fill front fenders and help with bottom line|last1=Borden|first1=Brett|date=April 11, 2008|website=[[ESPN|espn.go.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-20154"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|title=NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series &amp; Whelen Modified Tour Rulebook|date=2015|website=[[Waterford Speedbowl|speedbowlct.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623101256/http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series sponsor's logo is displayed on top of the windshield, called the windshield header or windshield banner.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-Xfinity-Trucks-20153"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/10/22/nascar-xfinity-camping-world-truck-series-2015-rules-enhancements-qualifying-logos.html|title=ENHANCEMENTS UNVEILED FOR XFINITY, TRUCK SERIES|author1=Staff report|date=October 22, 2014|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-20154" /&gt;

Beginning in 2013, the livery layout for the NASCAR Cup Series was altered, coinciding with the change to the [[Car of Tomorrow#Gen 6 era|Generation 6]] model car. In lieu of the series sponsor like in lower series, the windshield prominently features the last name of the driver (as well as first name or first initial in the case of siblings and family members, as is the case for both Busch brothers, or suffixes for drivers such as [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Martin Truex, Jr.]]) placed in the center of the windshield header. Logos of the manufacturer are placed on each corner of the upper windshield. Number and sponsor logos were barred from being placed on the headlights and taillights, as not to obstruct each car model's unique characteristics. A new location for a single sponsor logo, however, was added to the rear of the roof adjacent to the number.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-NewLook-Gen6-13"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Official Release|title=NEW LOOK READY FOR 2013 SPRINT CUP CAR|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/11/17/nascar-reveals-2013-sprint-cup-car.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a new layout was created for participants in the [[NASCAR Chase for the Championship]], requiring the cars to feature yellow roof numbers, front splitters and front fascias. The background of the windshield header would also be colored yellow, with the driver's name displayed in black lettering. A new Chase for the Championship logo would replace the normal NASCAR Cup Series logo in the contingency group. A decal would also be placed next to the driver's name above the door to signify each win a driver earned that season.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-ChaseScheme-2014"&gt;{{cite web|author1=NASCAR Official Release|title=NASCAR TO USE SPECIAL PAINT SCHEME FOR CHASE CONTENDERS|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/7/15/nascar-special-paint-scheme-chase-for-nascar-sprint-cup-contenders.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]|date=July 15, 2014|authorlink1=NASCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2015, the liveries of the [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]] would feature the driver's last name on the upper rear window.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-Xfinity-Trucks-2015"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Staff report|title=ENHANCEMENTS UNVEILED FOR XFINITY, TRUCK SERIES|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/10/22/nascar-xfinity-camping-world-truck-series-2015-rules-enhancements-qualifying-logos.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017, the Monster Energy logo is now on the front windshield with the driver name moving to the rear windshield in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]].

Outside of these requirements, teams may design the car and place sponsor logos in NASCAR-approved locations, and must submit all paint and graphics schemes and all sponsor identity to NASCAR in advance for approval.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"/&gt; One paint scheme requirement for example is that both the driver and passenger side of the car must share the same color pattern, though the front and rear may be different colors. This safety rule, to avoid confusion for spotters, NASCAR officials, and other drivers, was brought into light in October 2014 at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]], when [[Terry Labonte]]'s [[Go FAS Racing]] team painted his {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 32 car in two different color schemes as a tribute to the two-time champion, but prior to NASCAR approval. NASCAR allowed the team to retain the scheme for knock-out qualifying, but forced them to match the two sides for the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pockrass|first1=Bob|title=NASCAR won't OK tribute paint scheme for Terry Labonte|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2014-10-18/nascar-wont-ok-tribute-paint-scheme-for-terry-labonte|website=[[Sporting News]]|publisher=[[Sporting News]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Talladega, Alabama]]|date=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2016, it seems that NASCAR has either quietly removed this rule or allowed teams to race with a split-side scheme as long as they got the permission to do so, as seen with [[John Hunter Nemechek]]'s {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 8 truck in the [[2016 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|2016]] [[American Ethanol E15 225]] and both the {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 3 and {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 31 cars of RDV Compétition during the [[2016 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series]].

Teams apply to NASCAR for the use of a car number, and pay for the rights to the number's likeness. NASCAR legally owns and controls all rights to car numbers.&lt;ref name=NASCAR-RCRDillon3Cup-Dec2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series &amp; Whelen Modified Tour Rulebook|url=http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|website=[[Waterford Speedbowl|speedbowlct.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623101256/http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When drivers change teams, the team owner usually retains the number. Unlike in other series, such as the [[International Race of Champions|former IROC Series]], there is no provision for the defending series champion or the points leader to adopt car number 1; it is available to any team.

Teams can run numbers from 0 to 99 (as well as 00 to 09), but no two cars can display the same number during a race.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"/&gt; Teams that run 00 to 09 are listed as 100 to 109 for NASCAR's scoring purposes. Except for those numbers (which have been used for full-time teams), part-time teams may be assigned a three-digit number for scoring purposes only (such as Nos. 141 and 241). If two such teams arrive with the same two digit number, the team higher in championship points prevails, and the other team will be forced to change their number for the race.

==Sponsorship==

===Tobacco===
Although NASCAR has a long history of tobacco sponsorship, following the [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003 season]], longtime NASCAR partner [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]] declined to renew their [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] sponsorship of the Cup Series, replaced by Nextel Corporation.&lt;ref name=TobaccoFreeKids-NASCAR-03&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=Matthew L.|title=NASCAR Choice of Non-Tobacco Sponsor Is A Victory for Kids, Health and Auto Racing|url=http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press_releases/post/id_0658|website=tobaccofreekids.org|publisher=Tobacco-Free Kids|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=June 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] passed new regulations preventing sponsorship for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products in any sporting event, including auto racing events. The announcement affected two teams: the No. 33 Truck of [[Ron Hornaday, Jr.]] and [[Kevin Harvick, Inc.]] lost its [[Swedish Match|Longhorn Moist Snuff]] sponsorship, while the No. 27 Nationwide Series car of [[Baker Curb Racing]] lost its [[Red Man]] sponsorship.&lt;ref name=SportsBuisnessDigest-Tobacco-NASCAR-10&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending an era: Tobacco sponsorship in NASCAR|url=http://sportsbusinessdigest.com/2010/06/ending-an-era-tobacco-sponsorship-in-nascar/|website=Sports Business Digest|publisher=Sports Business Digest|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker Curb would shut its doors the next year due to lack of sponsorship.

In spite of the legislation, tobacco sponsorship continues in the sports through [[electronic cigarette]]s, with companies such as Green Smoke, [[blu eCigs|blu]] (owned by R.J. Reynolds), and Arrowhead sponsoring NASCAR teams. A brand of [[herbal smokeless tobacco]], Smokey Mountain, has also sponsored drivers such as Hornaday, [[Johnny Sauter]], [[Brian Scott]], and [[Daniel Hemric]].

===Viceroy rule===
Though [[NASCAR]] typically promotes competition between multiple brands, including those that sponsor the sport and individual races, the sanctioning body provides exclusive protection to its series title sponsors, such as [[Monster Energy]] in the Cup Series, as well as current fuel supplier [[Sunoco]].&lt;ref name=Savannah-Sprint-Sunoco-2007/&gt; This policy, known as the '''Viceroy rule''', prevents sponsorship from direct competitors within a certain series, although it does not prevent a company from moving to a different series within the sport, or advertising a product that does not directly conflict with the title sponsor. For example, [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Texaco]] and other oil companies have been allowed to promote their motor oil brands ([[Pennzoil]] and [[Havoline]] respectively) but not their gasoline products.&lt;ref name=Savannah-Sprint-Sunoco-2007/&gt; When a new title sponsor creates conflicts with existing team sponsors, NASCAR typically allows the team sponsors to remain under a [[grandfather clause]].&lt;ref name="Westmoreland-Viceroy-Sep2007"/&gt; The rule is named after the British cigarette brand [[Viceroy (cigarette)|Viceroy]], and is in reference to the [[1972 USAC Championship Car season]] during which title sponsor [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] renounced its branding when Viceroy entered the sport to sponsor entries.&lt;ref name=SBJ-NASCAR-Viceroy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yost|first1=Mark|title=History shows NASCAR the high stakes of sponsor conflict|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2007/04/20070402/Opinion/History-Shows-NASCAR-The-High-Stakes-Of-Sponsor-Conflict.aspx|website=[[Advance Publications|Sports Business Journal]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MassLive-NASCAR-Verizon&gt;{{cite web|author1=NASCAR|title=Verizon Wireless shifts its racing sponsorship from NASCAR to IndyCar|url=http://blog.masslive.com/racinwithjason/2010/12/verizon_wireless_shifts_its_racing_sponsorship_from_nascar_to_indycar.html|website=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|MassLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publication]], [[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=December 10, 2010|authorlink1=NASCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule has come into effect on several occasions, most notably when [[Nextel Communications]] signed a ten-year $700 million deal to replace Winston as the Cup Series sponsor.&lt;ref name=Lubbock-Nextel-NASCAR-03&gt;{{cite web|author1=Associated Press|title=NASCAR gets $700 million from in Nextel sponsorship deal|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/062003/pro_062003080.shtml|website=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|lubbockonline.com]]|publisher=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[New York City]]|date=June 20, 2003|authorlink1=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active sponsors [[Cingular Wireless]] (sponsoring [[Richard Childress Racing]]'s No. 31 team) and [[Alltel]] (sponsoring [[Team Penske]]'s No. 12 car of [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]]) were allowed to continue their deals,&lt;ref name=MassLive-NASCAR-Verizon /&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN-NASCAR-AT&amp;T-2007 /&gt; but both sponsor agreements were put into question when the companies were purchased and sought re-branding.&lt;ref name=Savannah-Sprint-Sunoco-2007&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coble|first1=Don|title=Sprint Nextel, Sunoco flex their muscles as NASCAR series sponsors|url=http://savannahnow.com/don-coble/2007-02-28/sprint-nextel-sunoco-flex-their-muscles-nascar-series-sponsors|website=[[Savannah Morning News|savannahnow.com]]|publisher=[[Savannah Morning News]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Robby Gordon was required to wear a full color Nextel patch on his driving suit.

==Special rules for combination races==
A combination race is a race run between multiple series that operate under compatible rules packages. During NASCAR's combination races (currently the two K&amp;N Pro Series ([[K&amp;N Pro Series East|East]] and [[K&amp;N Pro Series West|West]]), and formerly the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]]/[[K&amp;N Pro Series West|Winston West Series]] and [[Xfinity Series|Busch Series]]/[[K&amp;N Pro Series East|Busch North Series]]), there is one race, but points are scored for both series. In previous years, drivers were given points based on how they finished among competitors from the same series. For 2017, drivers will receive points in their series based on their actual finish in the race among all competitors. However, drivers who declare they are running for a championship in both series (East &amp; West) will be awarded points in both series, provided they have the appropriate license for both.

Special rules apply as two teams will have the same number. The fastest lap time in qualifying determines which team will have the number for the race, and which team must temporarily change the number for the race. For example, during the [[1991 NASCAR Busch Series|1991 Busch Series]] season, there were selected races in the Northeast ([[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|Loudon]], [[Nazareth Speedway|Nazareth]], [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]], [[Oxford Plains Speedway|Oxford]]) where both the Busch Grand National (now [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]]) and Busch Grand National North (now K&amp;N Pro East) Series raced in combination races. North team [[Ricky Craven]] (also drove his car) and Grand National team Don Beverly Racing ([[Jimmy Hensley]] driving) both used No. 25. Whoever had the faster qualifying time in each race used No. 25. Craven used No. 28 at Oxford when Hensley had the faster time, while Hensley used No. 5 when Craven had the faster time at Loudon. Both teams, however, scored respective owner points for the No. 25 in their respective series.

==Car and driver changes==
Teams must use a single car from the start of the first practice session through the end of the race. Teams that crash a car in practice or qualifying may go to a backup car, but racing a different car from the one that qualified results in that car having to start at the rear of the field.

Engine and transmission changes are prohibited during a race weekend. Xfinity and Truck Series engines must last two race weekends, excluding restrictor plate races. Changing either will result in starting in the rear of the field. Transmission changes are allowed during road course weekends and during the race weekends at [[Pocono Raceway]]. In addition, during [[Speedweeks]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] teams are allowed one free engine change between the qualifying races and final practice session.

Driver changes are permitted, however starting the race with a different driver than whom qualified the car will result in the car starting at the rear of the field. Driver changes during the race are permitted as well, performed during pit stops, but a team must incur any loss in position due to time spent swapping drivers. The driver who starts the race earns all the points, statistics, and purse money.&lt;ref name=Motorsport-Substitute-SadlerBowyer-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spivey|first1=Julian|title=NASCAR's substitute driver rule ... A flawed policy?|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-ns/news/nascar-s-substitute-driver-rule-a-flawed-policy-458301|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=27 November 2014|date=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caution flag and restart procedure==
When the yellow flag is displayed and the yellow caution lights around the track come on, the field is frozen immediately at the moment of caution. All scoring ends immediately and cars are to slow to [[Safety car|pace vehicle (safety car)]] speed. Cars will line up behind the pace vehicle in the order in which they passed the last scoring loop on track (there are as many as 18 loops around the track, although the one at the start/finish line is the only one that counts for official race statistics). The exception to this rule is if the yellow flag waves after the white flag is thrown (or, in the case of an overtime attempt, if the yellow flag waves after the race leader has crossed the overtime line) or if the race will not be restarted (typically for rain; but sometimes for darkness if a track does not have night lights), in which case NASCAR will use video evidence to determine the finishing order.

When the caution comes out, the pit lane is immediately closed, a rule first implemented following the 1989 [[Atlanta 500]]. This is shown by a flashing red light at the entrance to pit road. Entering pit road when it is closed (with certain exceptions) is a penalty of restarting at the rear of the field.  When pit road is open, a steady green light will appear at the entrance to pit road, and a green light will come on in the rear window of the pace vehicle.

During a "quickie yellow" all cars may enter pit road the first time by when it is opened. After the pit stops, the first car one lap down at the moment of caution (known as the free pass car) is permitted to go around the pace car and start the race at the rear of the field, but back on the lead lap.

During a full yellow, only lead lap cars may pit the first time by the pit road. Once the lead lap cars who have decided to pit have entered pit road, the free pass car will be sent around the pace car to earn their lap back. The next time by, all cars (including the free pass car) may pit.

Cars may pit as often as they wish at the expense of track position, but the free pass car is limited to taking fuel only at the first pit stop opportunity. If the free pass car is judged to have caused the caution (intentionally or not) there will be no free pass car.

At the one to go signal, the pace car will turn its lights off. At this point, any car that is ahead of the leader of the race will be waved around to the rear of the field. These cars are not permitted to pit until after the green flag comes back out and the race has resumed. The field will then line up double file for the restart. The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions on back) will always start in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions on back) will always start in the outside lane. The restart order is always this: Lead Lap Cars &gt; Cars 1 or more laps down &gt; Free Pass Car &gt; Wave Arounds &gt; Cars who have received a penalty.

Once the pace car has pulled into the pits, there is a restart "zone" consisting of lines painted on the outside wall of the track. The leader of the race is to begin accelerating inside this zone to resume the race. If they do not, the flagman controls the restart. The second place car may not be ahead of the leader at the moment of green flag, however either car on the front row may cross the start/finish line first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/09/15/nascar-drivers-meeting-restarts-chicagoland.html|title=NASCAR clarifies restart rules to drivers|last=Albert|first=Zack|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC.|date=September 15, 2013|website=NASCAR.com|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing is not permitted until the leader of the race crosses the start-finish line. Lane changes are also not permitted until after a car clears the finish line.

Per the NASCAR rule book, a restart is official once the legal lead car crosses the start/finish line. If the green flag is waved, but NASCAR calls off the restart because of an incident before the leader crosses the start/finish line, the restart is deemed aborted.

==Championship points system==

==Flags==
{{main article|Racing flags}}
Like most other sanctioning bodies, NASCAR will use flags to provide the drivers with information regarding track conditions. NASCAR, not adhering to the [[FIA]] rules (despite NASCAR being a member club of [[Automobile Competition Committee for the United States|ACCUS]], the U.S. motor racing sporting authority and representative to the [[FIA World Motor Sport Council]]), does not use the flag system outlined in the FIA International Sporting Code. Major differences include that in NASCAR (and other championships in [[North America]]) the white flag is used to signal that the leader is on the last lap, in FIA ISC regulated events (such as [[Formula One]] and most European championships) it is used to signal that a slower car is on track. Also, the blue flag specified in the FIA ISC does not have a diagonal stripe, and the black flag means that a driver is disqualified.

|[[File:Auto Racing Green.svg|left|40px|Green Flag]]|| The '''green flag''' indicates that the race has started or restarted. It is shown by the official in the flag stand when the leader enters the designated restart zone, which is located a short distance before the start/finish line.
|-
|[[File:Green-white checkered flag.png|left|40px|Green and White Checkered Flag]]

|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Yellow.svg|left|40px|Yellow Flag]]
|The '''yellow flag''', or '''caution flag''', indicates a hazard on the track&amp;nbsp;— most often an accident, but sometimes also for debris, light rain, emergency vehicles entering (usually on short tracks with no tunnel) or a scheduled competition caution (usually used for races that have been postponed due to inclement weather). All cars must slow down and follow the [[pace car]]. Passing is not allowed under the yellow flag. NASCAR experimented the "local yellow" flag in road courses; cautions apply to the entire circuit, including road courses.
|-
|[[File:F1 red flag.svg|left|40px|Red Flag]]

This may happen due to a large accident (such as a multi-car wreck like [[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]], inclement weather),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.speedtv.com/article/cup-rain-pounds-pocono-raceway/ |title=CUP: Pocono Race Under Red Flag |publisher=Nascar.speedtv.com |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; track repair (such as damaged catch fencing), or for severe track cleaning (such as the final laps, when NASCAR may clean the entire track to ensure the race can finish under green flag conditions, and to do so with the track clean of oil from engine failure or crashes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.about.com/b/2012/02/27/red-flag-for-flaming-jet-dryer.htm |title=Red Flag For Flaming Jet Dryer |publisher=Nascar.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cars may be ordered into the pits or on the track depending on conditions; red flags for inclement weather generally result in all cars parking in the pits. Race teams are not permitted to repair or adjust cars during red flag conditions. However, drivers may exit their cars, and they may be provided with water, food or other necessities. This flag is also used with the black flag to signal the end of a practice or qualifying session. 
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing White.svg|left|40px|White Flag]]
|The '''white flag''' indicates one lap remaining in the race. More specifically, it indicates that all drivers will be scored for at most 1 more lap after passing the white flag.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Chequered.svg|left|40px|Checkered Flag]]
|The '''checkered flag''' indicates that the race is over.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Black.svg|left|40px|Black Flag]]
|The '''black flag''' indicates that a driver must pit immediately. This flag is shown if the driver or pit crew violates a rule (e.g., speeding through the pits), if the vehicle has sufficient mechanical damage that it is a hazard to other drivers, if the vehicle cannot maintain the minimum required speed (varies by track; typically disclosed in the pre-race drivers' meeting), or if a driver has been driving overly aggressively. In the event of a failure of the in-car radio, NASCAR will, at the team's request, display the black flag to signal a driver to pit, one time only.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing White Cross.svg|left|40px|Black Flag with a White Cross]]
|The '''black flag with a white cross''' indicates that a driver is no longer being scored. This is normally shown if a driver does not respond to a black flag within three laps.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Blue.svg|left|40px|Blue Flag with a Yellow Stripe]]
|The '''blue flag with a yellow stripe''' is shown to warn slow drivers of faster cars approaching. NASCAR rarely black-flags drivers for not obeying this flag; however, it is frequently displayed and warnings may be given if it is blatant (such as a lapped driver blocking for a teammate). NASCAR uses the yellow diagonal stripe on the blue flag because the flag is usually displayed on top of the starter's stand, and not at eye-level to the driver from the track.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Plain Blue.svg|left|40px|Blue Flag]]
|The '''blue flag''' is used to indicate an area on a road course where drivers should be careful due to slow or stopped cars or a partially blocked track. It is not used on ovals. If a full-course caution is required, NASCAR will use the yellow flag to indicate this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2004-06-24-infineon-preview_x.htm] Article on blue flag&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the local caution commonly used in other racing series, the blue flag is not a "local caution" and does not prohibit overtaking; rather, it merely tells drivers to be careful. Safety workers will not leave their designated spots and enter the track under this flag. In the wake of a fatal corner worker crash at Daytona International Speedway in 2004 in a non-NASCAR sanctioned race (but using track workers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newberry |first=Paul |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2004-02-08-dash-accident_x.htm |title=Track worker killed during Dash race at Daytona |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2004-02-10 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASCAR has become reluctant in recent years to use local cautions, opting to use the full-course yellow caution flag instead if any safety team members have to approach the track in an attempt to give safety workers a safer environment to inspect debris by forcing all cars under pace car speed, instead of race speed, to remove debris. The rationale is most of the field will be packed together while cleanup is happening, instead of being spread over the entire track.
|}

==Qualifying procedure==

===Standard procedure===
A knockout system similar to [[Formula One]] is used. During the time allotted, teams are allowed unlimited attempts to qualify with their fastest lap of each round counting as their official time.

Between attempts, cars are parked on pit road, where teams may hook up a cooling system through the cal flap in front of the windshield to cool the engine. However, teams are not permitted to raise the hood or make other significant adjustments during qualifying. Also, tires may not be changed without approval from NASCAR, who will only grant approval in cases of flat tires or safety issues.

On all open engine ovals in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, tracks shorter than 2 miles in the Xfinity Series, and tracks shorter than 1.5 miles in the Camping World Truck Series, round 1 is 15 minutes long. The fastest 24 advance to round 2 which is 10 minutes long. The fastest 12 advance to round 3 which determines pole position. In addition to determine who advances to round 2, round 1 also determines who will and will not qualify for the race and starting positions 25–40 (Cup Series), 25–40 (Xfinity), or 25–32 (Camping World Truck). Similarly, round 2 will determine starting positions 13–24, with round 3 determining positions 1–12.

On road courses, there are only two sessions: Round 1 is 25 minutes with the top 12 advancing to Round 2 which is 10 minutes.

In the event rain falls between rounds, NASCAR has the option of declaring the session over and the speeds from the previous round will count for all remaining starting positions.

===Restrictor plate tracks, ovals longer than 2 miles in Xfinity, and ovals longer than 1.5 miles in Trucks===
Due to how the draft works in restrictor plate racing, and a series of crashes in qualifying during 2015 Speedweeks, a single car qualifying format is used for restrictor plate racetracks. In July 2015, after making rules changes to the cars designed to increase drag and drafting, NASCAR used the format at Indianapolis and Michigan (but discontinued its use at both tracks for 2016). The single car system will only be used at the plate tracks, ovals 2 miles and longer in the Xfinity series, and ovals 1.5 miles or longer in the Truck series.

In round 1, cars are sent out one at a time at the direction of a NASCAR official. Each car has one warm-up lap, one timed lap, and one cool down lap. NASCAR will release cars roughly half a lap apart to prevent any aerodynamic advantage from being gained from a competitor's car. The order in which cars go on track is the inverse of practice speeds.  As with the road course format, the top 12 cars advance to the final round.

After the final car has returned to pit road in the first round, all 12 qualifying teams may hook up the cooling system to the car for 10 minutes. Round 2 cars will qualify from slowest to fastest based off their speeds from round 1. The fastest car will win the pole.

===Daytona 500 provisions===
The session results from single car qualifying set the starting lineups for the [[Can-Am Duel]] races on Thursday.
The duel races are two 60 lap/150 mile races. The first race consists of those who finished qualifying in odd-numbered positions and sets the lineup for odd-numbered positions in the 500. The second race does the same for even-numbered positions. However, there must be an equal number of "open" or "non-chartered" teams in each Duel race. After the Duel races, the lineup is set as follows:

* Positions 1–2: Fastest two qualifiers in Sunday's single car qualifying.
* Positions 3–38: Duel race results, consisting of all chartered teams and the highest finishing non-chartered team in each Duel.
* Positions 39-40: The fastest two cars of non-chartered teams that are not already qualified, based on Sunday's qualifying session.

===Provisional rule===
All three NASCAR national series will set a specific number of starting positions by timed laps and have a specific number of starting positions based on owner points of vehicles that have not already qualified.

*  Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series:  36 / 4
*  Xfinity Series: 33 / 6 / 1
*  Camping World Truck Series (except Eldora):  27 / 4 / 1

In the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series four positions are awarded to the fastest qualifying open teams. In the Xfinity Series, six positions are awarded based on owner points to cars not already qualified. In the Camping World Truck Series, four positions are awarded based on owner points to trucks not already qualified.

The final position in the Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series is reserved for a past series champion. Each past champion can use this past champions' provisional up to six times per season. If the past champions' provisional is not needed, then the position goes to the first team in owner points not already qualified for the race. If a former champion driver's team is one of the top six or four teams, respectively, highest in owner points, not already qualified, then that does not count against usage of the provisional. 
If there are 40 or less (or 32 or less) vehicles entered in the respective races, no provisionals are charged and the field will be determined by timed laps only.

After these positions are awarded, the cars are arranged by lap times.

====Past champion's provisional====
In 1991, NASCAR introduced the past champion's provisional (sometimes known as the "Petty rule") after [[Richard Petty]] failed to qualify in four races in 1989, which resulted in a viewership ratings drop that season. This special provisional allowed a former Cup champion to claim the final starting position if he was too low in the points standings and was unable to qualify by speed. The past champion's provisional worked perfectly until 1997, when [[Darrell Waltrip]] failed to make the [[Bank of America Roval 400|UAW-GM Quality 500]] lineup because [[Terry Labonte]] was the more recent champion and was higher in points. NASCAR considered revising the guidelines to the past champion's provisional after Waltrip used it to enter 20 races in 1998. In 2004, NASCAR gave past Cup champions a maximum of 10 past champion's provisionals per season; this number was reduced to six in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/racing/news/story?id=2740483&amp;seriesId=2 |title=Past champion's provisional entry limited to six |author=Newton, David |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=eVi3hg7Y6ZkC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=NASCAR+past+champions+provisional&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VXmxstGUul&amp;sig=LMhoMulSUmrddPk6R5FTkJN4avk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig6bDixLTaAhWKbbwKHWrpABkQ6AEIYTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=NASCAR%20past%20champions%20provisional&amp;f=false |title=''NASCAR for Dummies'' |author=[[Mark Martin|Martin, Mark]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] via [[Google Books]] |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved disastrous for [[Dale Jarrett]] in 2007, as he moved to a fledgling [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] with no owner points and failed to qualify in 12 races after being forced to use all of his past champion's provisionals at the start of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/news/dale-jarrett-hall-of-fame-2014-ned-daytona-500-joe-gibbs-robert-yates/1fdor8jjodtgn106lwxvy4rzy0 |title=Dale Jarrett relishes joining father Ned in NASCAR Hall of Fame |author=Pockrass, Bob |publisher=[[Sporting News]] |date=January 27, 2014 |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The past champion's provisional was discontinued from the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series as part of the new Charter system and qualifying system in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jayski.com/news/stats/2016/story/_/page/2016-NASCAR-Past-Champions-Provisional |title=2016 Past Champions Provisional |publisher=Jayski's NASCAR Silly Season Site/[[ESPN]] |date=February 12, 2016 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-Star Weekend qualifying===
The Open uses the standard procedure, but with only 8 cars advancing to the final round. All-Star race qualifying consists of the combined time of 3 laps with a 4-tire pit stop. The fastest 5 drivers in the opening round advance to the final round.

===Eldora===
The [[Eldora Dirt Derby]] has a unique qualifying format. Each truck will take two timed laps, with the faster lap counting as that truck's official time. The trucks are assigned to one of five heat races where the top five trucks from each will advance to the feature. Those that fail to qualify will have one last chance race, where the top two trucks will also advance. Provisionals will be determined after the last chance race.

===Daytona Clash===
The [[Advance Auto Parts Clash]] is an annual invitation-only race held the weekend before the Daytona 500, and sets its lineup via a random draw.

==Penalties==
The following is a list of NASCAR penalties. Penalties listed as "NASCAR Discretion" can result in a simple restart at the tail of the field, a multiple lap penalty, or disqualification.

===Restarting at the End of the Line for the Ensuing Restart===

# Pitting before pit road is open (Section 10-4B), administered if a driver enters pit road while the flashing lights indicating pit road is closed are on (certain exceptions apply)
# Pitting out of order (10-4B)

===Restarting at the End of the Line (caution) or Drive-Through Penalty (green flag)===

# Car/truck must enter pit road in single file (9-15C)
# Speeding while entering or exiting pit road (9-15D)
# Passing on pit road from the inside on entry (9-15C)
# Driving through more than 3 pit boxes to enter their pit stall (9-15C).
# Crewmember(s) over the wall too soon (9-15E)
# Use of extension poles are limited/not self illuminated (9-15G))
# Crew members returning from the equipment side of the wall (9-15H), not carrying the front air wrench back to the pit wall side of the car/truck (9-15J),
# Using more than two (2) air wrenches during one pit stop (9-15J)
# Non-compliant refueling
# Tossing or throwing the fuel filler/equipment (9-15M)
# Rolling a tire(s) beyond the center of pit road (9-15P)
# Hand pushing the car/truck more than 3 pit boxes to restart it (9-15Q)
# Going above the blend line exiting the pits (9-11) (except when safety vehicle requests such happen during pit stops during cautions).
# Car making entrance to pit road after crossing plane of pit entrance line or cone on track side (not pit side) of said point (9-15B)
## If the car is entering pit road to avoid an incident and has to cross the plane of road line track side, then enter pit road, no penalty.
## At Martinsville Speedway, the car must have two wheels cross the pit entrance line before the Turn 3 pit entrance.

===Stop and Go Penalty===
# Removing equipment from assigned pit area (9-15O).
# Speeding on pit road during pass-through penalty  (9-15R).

===Pass-Through Penalty===
# Jumping any green flag (10-2A)
# Passing after specific point on the "One to Go" signal (Turn 3 of most ovals, Turn 2 at Pocono, Turn 10 at Sonoma or Watkins Glen) (9-11)
# Passing on a start or restart (before start/finish line) (9-11)
# Illegal Lane Change on restart (9-11)
# Unapproved mechanical adjustment (flaring of rocker panels most notably) (10-7-1-1).
## Penalty only under yellow condition, enforced on the second lap following a restart, in addition to starting at the tail end of the field during for that restart. Under green condition, NASCAR will not allow the car on the track until the car is repaired legally.
# Failure to make qualifying attempt because of numerous failed pre-race technical inspections.
## Three failed inspection attempts also involves ejection of crew member.
## Four failed inspection attempts also involved a ten-point penalty.

===One Lap Penalty===
# Car/truck pitting out of the assigned pit box (9-15F) (NASCAR may relax the rule at tracks with shorter pit boxes)
# Passing the [[safety car]] (10-4D) (except for cars being subjected to the wave-around, or at some tracks where the radius of pit road is shorter than track, as in Martinsville and Bristol, where the pit road speed limit applies, and the safety car may be passed.)
# Pulling up to pit (9-15A) -- (drivers must maintain position in relation to field or face penalty, again rule differs at Martinsville and Bristol)
# Refueling car before race start OR when before the designated race distance, as in a competition caution called because of weather, passes (9-6D and 9-6E). Additional laps may be added to penalty.

====Penalties assessed at NASCAR's discretion====
# Running over/under equipment (9-15O)
# Running the stop and go sign/light (10-4C) (must be blatant;  crossing the plane of the line or pole but stopping is not a penalty)
# Disobeying NASCAR request (9-11)
# Intentionally causing a caution (9-11)
# Verbal abuse to a NASCAR official (9-11)
# Disobeying Black Flag (10-6A)
# Safety violation

NASCAR conducts a complete technical inspection prior to the first practice session, before and after qualifying, and before the race. A quick safety inspection is also completed prior to each practice session after the first. Penalties for car violations are typically announced the Wednesday after a race, and can range from a simple fine to a suspension (typically a maximum of 12 races) and loss of points. After a race, the top 5 finishers, one other random car, and the first car failing to finish the race not due to an accident will have their cars inspected. The winner, random car, and first car out also have their cars and engines taken by NASCAR for further inspection at the NASCAR Research and Development Center. Further, there is one random race per year where NASCAR confiscates 15-20 engines and takes them to NASCAR's Research and Development Center for evaluation, comparison, and to help decide on future rule changes.

Starting in 2017, NASCAR will attempt to issue more penalties during a race weekend instead of waiting until Wednesday. There will now be L1 and L2 penalties:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2017/2/16/nascar-announces-new-deterrence-penalty-policy.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* L1 penalties concern areas of minimum heights and weights, the Laser Inspection Station (LIS), gear ratios, and flagrant lug nut violations where 17 or fewer are properly secured. Penalties will be a 10-40 point deduction, suspension for 1-3 races, plus a fine up to $75,000.
* L2 penalties involve more egregious infractions concerning tampering with the three "no man's land" technical areas of tires, engine and fuel. Major safety violations, the use of telemetry or traction control, plus breaches of the testing policy also fall under the L2 designation. These penalties will be a 75-point deduction, a 4-6 race suspension, and a fine up to $200,000.
* "Encumbered" finishes: The rules allow a victory to stand in the event of an infraction, but a winning team will be stripped of the benefits associated with the win.
* The list of pre-race penalties within a race weekend at the series directors' disposal, in order of increasing severity: Loss of annual "hard card" credential, loss of practice time, loss of pit selection position, tail of the field penalty, a green-flag pass-through on pit road after the initial start, a green-flag stop-and-go in the pits after the start, and lap(s) penalty.

As a member of ACCUS/FIA, NASCAR has a [[substance abuse]] policy requiring random testing of drivers, crew members, and officials. Those who have violated the policy (including suspensions for [[domestic violence]]) are suspended indefinitely immediately and given the opportunity to enroll in NASCAR's Road to Recovery program to be re-instated into NASCAR.

==Pit road==
[[File:Nascar Pit Road photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|NASCAR officials on pit road at [[Sonoma Raceway]]]]
During a race, teams must pit several times for refueling and new tires. Teams are permitted five crew members over the wall at the start of the race; that consists of two tire changers, one tire carrier, a jackman, and a gas man. Once NASCAR gives the OK (usually once the leader begins lapping cars), a 6th crew member is permitted only to service the driver/windshield. With the 2018 NASCAR rule changes, the gas man is now not allowed to make any adjustments to the car when refueling it.

There is an established pit road speed limit for each race. Since NASCAR cars do not have speedometers, the first [[Parade lap|pace lap]] of each race is run at pit road speed so drivers can get a tachometer reading for pit speed. There are a variety of other safety rules (see penalties above) that must be followed.

At the moment of caution or when there are two laps to go in the stage, pit road is immediately closed. NASCAR uses both a light at the end of pit road and a series of cameras to help determine the moment pit road is closed. The pits are opened once the field is under control of the pace/safety car unless there is an accident near the entrance/exit or on pit road, in which case the pits will remain closed until NASCAR deems the pits are safe to open.

After an incident at the June 2015 Chicagoland Xfinity race where the pit flagman waved a green flag but the light at the end of pit road was red, NASCAR added a light to the rear of the pace/safety car to help inform drivers and teams when pit road will be open, and thus removed the flagman from the entrance of pit road. NASCAR's official policy is that in the event of a discrepancy, the light at the end of pit road is official.

Starting in 2017, cars sustaining accident damage that cannot be repaired on pit road within 5 minutes will automatically be removed from the rest of the race. Speeding on pit road will see that time reduced by 15 seconds per infraction. Further, teams are not allowed to replace bodywork once the race begins. Teams using more than 5 crew members will also have their car removed from the race.

==Crew rosters==
For the 2018 season, NASCAR created a new roster system. This system would standardize the number of at-track team members. Rosters are split into three categories: Organizational, Road Crew, and Pit Crew. 

Examples of Organizational roster spots include competition director, team managers, technical director, IT specialists. In the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, teams are allotted three organizational roster spots for one- and two-car operations, and four spots for three- and four-car outfits. XFINITY and Camping World Truck Series teams are allowed one organizational roster spot each.

Examples of Road Crew include crew chief, car chief, mechanics, engine tuners, engineers, specialists (for areas such as tires, aerodynamics and shocks) and spotters. The limits for these personnel by series: Monster Energy Series, 12; XFINITY, 7; Camping World Trucks, 6. 

Pit Crews are the same in all series, with the maximum number being 5. 

The exceptions to these numbers are slight. Monster Energy Series teams are allowed one extra road crew position at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the three road courses (Sonoma, Watkins Glen, Charlotte), where teams often use multiple spotters. Also, an additional road crew roster spot will be allowed for XFINITY teams at 10 races and Truck Series teams at five. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/11/22/nascar-to-standardize-at-track-rosters-beginning-in-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race procedure==
Starting in 2017, NASCAR announced they may reserve the right to move up the start of the race one hour to beat inclement weather (heavy rain and lighting on road courses).

Two hours before the race, drivers and crew chiefs attend a mandatory driver's meeting.  They are required to attend in person, and no exceptions are allowed (which has caused trouble with drivers attempting the Memorial Day Double). Failure to attend the meeting will force drivers to start at the rear of the field. In August 2015, NASCAR announced they would experiment moving the driver's meeting to only one hour before the race since meetings at most races take less than 15 minutes.

Roughly a 30 to 45 minutes before the race start time, driver introductions will be held. Failure to attend these will also require the driver to start at the rear of the field as well.

At the designated start time, a pre-race invocation is given, followed by the singing of the national anthem. Once the anthem is complete, drivers have exactly five minutes to get in their cars with all the safety equipment fastened and ready to go. At the end of those five minutes, the grand marshal for the race will deliver the command "Drivers, start your engines!", at which point each car must start its engine. With the engines running, the cars sit on pit road for approximately three minutes before heading on the track for some warm-up laps before the pace car. The average number of pace laps is three, but there can be more or less depending on a wide variety of circumstances and conditions, including but not limited to track length, track drying efforts after rain, or if a car has a problem and stops on the track during those pace laps. At the end of the pace laps, the field will partake in a rolling start.

If the last lap of the race is started under caution, the race will be extended per [[Green–white–checker finish|NASCAR Overtime]]. Once the track is clear, the field will be given the green flag with two laps remaining. If there is another crash/caution before the leader reaches the "overtime line," usually located on the backstretch, then the race will continue to be extended until the leader reaches the line. However, when the leader of the race reaches the overtime line, the next flag (caution or checkered) will end the race (although competitors are required to cross the start/finish line at pace car speed to be scored in their position at the moment of caution).

After the race, the winning driver (and, if at the end of the season, championship winning driver) will usually complete a series of burnouts in celebration of their victory, before heading to victory lane for more celebrations and post-race interviews.

==Safety==
{{main article|Safety in NASCAR}}
Since late 2001, a head and neck restraint has been required for usage of all drivers. Since 2005 the [[HANS Device]] (Head and Neck Support Device) has been the only such approved device. Since 2003, helmets have been required for pit crew members as well. Drivers and pit crew members must also wear firesuits. Drivers are required to use carbon fiber seats and headrests for strength and durability. Cars have also been redesigned since the 2001 [[death of Dale Earnhardt]] and after spectacular crashes to reflect new discoveries and developments in safety.

All oval tracks in any of NASCAR's National Series (except Eldora) use the [[SAFER Barrier]] and other soft wall technology to lessen impacts.

After a series of flips and dangerous crashes in the 1980s, NASCAR began requiring all cars to run a [[restrictor plate]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. The restrictor plate limits air into the engine, reducing horsepower and speed at these tracks from 230-240&amp;nbsp;mph to 195-200&amp;nbsp;mph. At these races, in addition to the restrictor plate, there are a variety of other technical rules and regulations to keep the cars stable and on the track. In addition to these technical rules, restrictor plate races are the only races where drivers are prohibited from using the apron of the track to execute a pass. A double yellow line separates the track from the racing surface, leading many to call the rule the "Yellow Line Rule." Driving under the line to advance one's position is subject to a drive-through penalty, or if the foul occurs on the last lap that car will be relegated to the last car on the lead lap in official race results.

==Testing==
NASCAR previously sanctioned an annual 4-day pre-season test at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in January for all teams until 2015, when all private testing was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://racing.ap.org/article/nascar-sets-testing-ban-includes-daytona-500-0|title=NASCAR sets testing ban that includes Daytona 500|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|date=2014-09-23|website=Associated Press|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that test, each organization was allowed four 2-day tests. Each test was required to be at a different race track. Rookie drivers were allocated an additional test. Beginning in 2016, each team is eligible to participate in five open tests that will occur at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Watkins Glen International, Chicagoland Speedway, and Homestead-Miami Speedway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/12/goodyear-tire-test-dates-set-for-2016-season.html|title=Testing schedule for 2016 set|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|date=2016-01-12|publisher=NASCAR|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tire supplier [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] is allowed unlimited testing and can ask whichever teams it wants to complete the test. Usually Goodyear chooses the top three finishers from the previous year's event to run the test. However, Goodyear formerly staged a full-field tire test at Indianapolis in late June/early July in preparations for the [[Brickyard 400]].

==Weekend schedule==
The [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] usually runs one day of practice and qualifying on Friday, followed by a second day of practice on Saturday morning, followed by the race on Sunday. If running a Saturday night race, the second day of practice is not held. During impound races, the three-day schedule is maintained, with qualifying taking place of Saturday practice.

The [[Xfinity Series]] will run practice on Friday, followed by qualifying a few hours before the race on Saturday. If a race is on Friday (or the schedule is otherwise compacted for other reasons), it is not uncommon for practice, qualifying, and the race to all be held on the same day. The [[Camping World Truck Series]] usually does this.

Rain can and often does affect the weekend schedule. When it does, qualifying is routinely cancelled and the starting lineup is set by owners points (previous year's points for the first 3 races). Whenever a race is postponed due to rain, then the race is usually scheduled for the following day (i.e., a Saturday night race postponed to Sunday afternoon or a Sunday afternoon race postponed to Monday afternoon).

The pool was alleged to have been in operation from [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009]] (the year in which the Saints won [[Super Bowl XLIV]]) to [[2011 New Orleans Saints season|2011]].

League commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] responded with some of the most severe sanctions in the league's 92-year history, and among the most severe punishments for in-game misconduct in North American professional sports history. Defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]] was suspended indefinitely, though this would be overturned the following year. Head coach [[Sean Payton]] was suspended for the entire [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]—the first time since [[Chuck Fairbanks]] in 1978 that a head coach had been suspended. General manager [[Mickey Loomis]] was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season. Assistant head coach [[Joe Vitt]] was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season. The Saints organization was penalized with a $500,000 fine and forced to forfeit their second-round draft selections in [[2012 NFL Draft|2012]] and [[2013 NFL Draft|2013]]. In May 2012, four current and former Saints players were suspended after being named as ringleaders in the scandal, with linebacker [[Jonathan Vilma]] also being suspended for the entire 2012 season.&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7881761/nfl-bans-four-players-new-orleans-saints-bounty-roles|title=Jonathan Vilma banned one year|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, former commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] overturned all sanctions against the players in December 2012 after finding that despite the players being "very much involved", the coaches and the Saints organization were primarily responsible for the scandal.&lt;ref name=Tagliabuevacate/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Gregg Williams at Tulane Commencement 2010.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Saints defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]]]]
The NFL has long frowned upon bounties, or "non-contract bonuses" as it officially calls them;  but an underground culture of bounties is alleged to exist, with teams, it is claimed,  [[turning a blind eye]] to the practice.  The league constitution specifically forbids payment of bonuses based on performances against an individual player or team, as well as bonuses for on-field misconduct; the NFL holds that such practices undermine the integrity of the game, and also would allow teams to use such payments to circumvent the [[salary cap]]. The [[collective bargaining agreement]] with the [[NFL Players Association]] also forbids this practice, as does the standard NFL player contract.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt; Every year, the NFL sends a memo reiterating this ban to every team before training camp opens. However, according to many former players, bounty systems of some sort have been around the NFL for decades, with the percentage of players participating non-scientifically estimated to be between 30 and 40 percent.&lt;ref name=Freeman2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17595418/saints-took-common-practice-of-a-bounty-system-to-new-dangerous-level|title=Saints took common practice of bounties to new, dangerous level|last=Freeman|first=Mike|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020180352/http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17595418/saints-took-common-practice-of-a-bounty-system-to-new-dangerous-level|archivedate=2012-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to these players, such bounty programs were usually informal and often between players only, more with intent at locker-room braggadocio than systemic malice.  What would draw attention to the Saints' bounty program was the alleged practice of methodically organizing such a concept at the coaches' level, with the primary intent to systematically and routinely injure opposing star players.

After the Saints defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the [[2009–10 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: New Orleans Saints 31, Minnesota Vikings 28 (OT)|NFC Championship Game]], several Vikings players and coaches claimed that the Saints were deliberately trying to hurt Vikings quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. The Vikings were particularly angered when Saints defensive end [[Bobby McCray]] and defensive tackle [[Remi Ayodele]] knocked Favre to the ground with a high-low hit. McCray hit Favre below the knees, briefly knocking Favre out of the game with an ankle injury. No penalty was called on the play, though NFL vice president of officiating [[Mike Pereira]] said one should have been called, saying it was "the type of hit we don't want." Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] later said that there were at least 13 instances where he felt the Saints deliberately went after Favre. Later, [[CBSSports.com]] NFL columnist Clark Judge said several Vikings assistants told him they believed McCray was acting on direct orders from Williams, with at least one being so outraged that he threatened to "punch [Williams] in the face" the next time they met.&lt;ref name=ClarkJudge&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17546706/saints-team-officials-involved-in-bounty-program-should-pay-dearly|title=Saints, team officials involved in bounty program should pay dearly|last=Judge|first=Clark|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikings owner [[Zygi Wilf]] even went as far as to complain to the league about what happened to Favre, though no action was taken at the time.&lt;ref name=Seifert&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39041/saints-shots-at-brett-favre-were-no-secret|title=Saints' shots at Favre were no secret|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favre took such a severe beating that Vikings punter [[Chris Kluwe]] and placekicker [[Ryan Longwell]] wondered during the game if someone had put a bounty on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39907/chris-kluwe-ban-jonathan-vilma-for-life|title=Chris Kluwe: Ban Jonathan Vilma for life|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Favre's agent, Bus Cook, later said that he also felt the Saints were deliberately trying to knock Favre out of the game, and claimed that several hits on [[Arizona Cardinals]] quarterback [[Kurt Warner]] in the divisional round a week earlier crossed the line as well.&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7638603/new-orleans-saints-defense-had-bounty-program-nfl-says|title=NFL: Saints defense had 'bounty' fund|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It initially appeared that Cook's argument was strengthened by the fact that Warner was knocked out of that game with a chest injury (although he later returned), and retired two weeks later. However, Warner later said that the hit which knocked him out was legal, and had nothing to do with his decision to retire.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcwest/post/_/id/59989/warner-saints-hit-legal-not-career-ending|title=Warner: Saints hit legal, not career-ending|last=Bando|first=Sal|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

[[File:Roger Goodell at Super Bowl 43.jpg|thumb|right|100px|NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]]]]
In the 2010 offseason, an anonymous player told NFL officials that the Saints had targeted Favre and Warner as part of a bounty program administered by Williams; the NFL's security department found the allegations credible enough to open an investigation. However, the players and team officials interviewed all denied that any bounty program existed, and the player who made the initial report subsequently recanted his allegations.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/peter_king/03/02/saints.bounties/index.html|title=Saints looking at severe punishment for bounty system|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL began investigating the Saints in 2010 in response to allegations of deliberate attempts to injure players during the [[2009–10 NFL playoffs|2009–10 playoffs]], but the investigation stalled until late in the 2011 season. On March 2, 2012, the NFL announced that it had evidence that [[defensive coordinator]] [[Gregg Williams]] had created the program soon after his arrival in 2009, and alleged that "between 22 and 27 Saints players" were involved.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/03/full_nfl_statement_into_bounty.html|title=Full NFL statement on bounty investigation|author=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-02|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and the players pooled their own money to pay out performance bonuses. It also asserted that head coach [[Sean Payton]] tried to cover up the scheme, and that he and general manager [[Mickey Loomis]] failed to shut it down when ordered to do so by team owner [[Tom Benson]]. Since then, Williams has been accused of operating similar schemes during his tenure as defensive coordinator of the [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee Oilers/Titans]] and [[Washington Redskins]] and as head coach of the [[Buffalo Bills]]; the NFL briefly investigated these allegations but elected to focus on the Saints.

==Whistleblower==

In 2012, ESPN reported that former New Orleans Saints defensive assistant Mike Cerullo contacted the NFL regarding a bounty program after the 2009 postseason. &lt;ref name=Barr1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8744952/mike-cerullo-former-new-orleans-saints-assistant-sends-letter-former-nfl-commissioner-paul-tagliabue|title=Mike Cerullo: I've been 'vilified'|last=Barr|first=John|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerullo was released after the 2009 postseason for poor performance and lying about personal leave according to the New Orleans Saints.&lt;ref name=Katzenstein1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2017/12/sean_payton_mike_cerullo.html|title=Sean Payton: NFL hiring of bounty whistleblower Mike Cerullo 'unbelievable'|last=Katzenstein|first=Josh|publisher=[[NOLA.com]]|date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cerullo testified that he kept track of payments and pledges made. Cerullo also states in the article, "I was angry for being let go from the Saints". In the summer of 2017, the NFL hired Mike Cerullo as Director of Football Administration. &lt;ref name=Katzenstein2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2017/12/sean_payton_mike_cerullo.html|title=Sean Payton: NFL hiring of bounty whistleblower Mike Cerullo 'unbelievable'|last=Katzenstein|first=Josh|publisher=[[NOLA.com]]|date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Findings revealed==
Late in the 2011 season, the NFL received what it called "significant and credible new information" that suggested there was indeed a "bounty" program in place.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt; League officials, convinced that this information was irrefutable evidence a program was indeed in place, alerted Benson of their findings just before the Saints' first-round playoff game against the [[Detroit Lions]].&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/1009529/62/2|title=Way out of Bounds|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation continued during the [[2011–12 NFL playoffs|2011–12 playoffs]] and continued through the 2012 offseason.

On March 2, 2012, [[ESPN]]'s [[Adam Schefter]] reported that the NFL had indeed found evidence of a bounty program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:7638694|title=Saints D Kept Bounty Fund|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the NFL announced it had obtained irrefutable proof of a bounty pool dating back to the 2009 season, based on a review of 18,000 documents. It determined that Williams had initiated the fund soon after he arrived in New Orleans in 2009, in hopes of making the defense more aggressive. Between 22 and 27 Saints defensive players were involved. The players and Williams contributed their own cash to the pot, and received cash payments based on their performance in the previous week's game. For instance, a [[special teams|special teamer]] who downed a kick returner inside the receiving team's 20-yard-line earned $100. Players could also be fined for mental mistakes and penalties. Players also received "bounties" for "cart-offs" (plays in which an opponent was removed from the field on a stretcher or cart) and "knockouts" (plays that resulted in a player being unable to return for the rest of the game). Players usually earned $1,000 for "cart-offs" and $1,500 for "knockouts" during the regular season, though they were encouraged to put their winnings back into the pot in order to raise the stakes as the season went on. Payments were known to double or even triple during the playoffs.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt;&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827c15b2/article/nfl-announces-management-discipline-in-saints-bounty-matter|title=NFL announces management discipline in Saints' 'bounty' matter|work=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL sent a confidential and detailed memo to all 32 teams detailing its findings. It revealed that the Saints had not only targeted Warner and Favre during the 2009 playoffs, but had also targeted [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] and [[Carolina Panthers]] quarterback [[Cam Newton]] during the 2011 regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcsouth/post/_/id/32684/nfl-saints-targeted-cam-newton|title=NFL: Saints targeted Cam Newton|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that memo, Saints linebacker [[Jonathan Vilma]] offered $10,000 cash to any teammate who knocked Favre out of the NFC Championship Game.&lt;ref name=King/&gt; Another source told CBSSports.com's Mike Freeman that [[Reggie Bush]]'s agent at the time, Michael Ornstein, was closely involved in the scheme from the beginning. Ornstein contributed $10,000 to the pot in 2009, and an undisclosed amount in 2011.&lt;ref name=Freeman1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mike-freeman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6264363/35066335|title=NFL memo details more Saints bounty accusations|last=Freeman|first=Mike|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306043855/http://mike-freeman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6264363/35066335|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After later investigations in the 2012 offseason, the NFL also found evidence that the Saints put a bounty on then-[[Seattle Seahawks]] quarterback, [[Matt Hasselbeck]] during their 2011 wild-card playoffs game.

The league found that Payton not only knew about the scheme, but tried to cover it up during both league investigations. During the 2010 investigation, Payton told Williams and Vitt to "make sure our ducks are in a row" when the league interviewed them. Before the start of the 2011 season, Payton received an email from Ornstein detailing the broader lines of the scheme. In that same email, Ornstein offered $5,000 to anyone who knocked Rodgers out of the 2011 season opener. Payton initially denied knowing that this email existed, but subsequently admitted that in fact he had read it.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/03/mike_ornsteins_association_wit.html|title=Mike Ornstein's association with New Orleans Saints and bounty scandal a perplexing situation|last=Duncan|first=Jeff|publisher=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7718136/sean-payton-new-orleans-saints-banned-one-year-bounties|title=NFL hammers Saints for bounties|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Benson was informed of the league's findings, he called in Payton and Loomis and ordered the program shut down immediately. However, they did not do so. Loomis had been interviewed during the 2010 investigation as well, and had stated that he knew of no such scheme and would stop it immediately if it was taking place. The league also found that Vitt, whom Payton had assigned to monitor Williams (the two reportedly didn't get along very well), also knew about the broader lines of the scheme and even witnessed Williams handing out payments to players. However, Vitt failed to tell anyone about it.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;

The NFL found that Payton and Loomis' [[misfeasance]] amounted to "conduct detrimental" to the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82757bcd/article/nfl-says-saints-created-bounty-program-from-20092011|title=NFL says Saints created 'bounty' program from 2009–2011|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL found no club money had been used to fund the bounty pool, and praised Benson for doing what he could to shut down the slush fund. Nonetheless, it found the Saints organization as a whole guilty of conduct detrimental to the league as well due to Williams and the players' maintenance of the bounty pool, as well as Loomis and Payton's failure to act "in a responsible manner" to stop it.&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;&lt;ref name=KingMarch5&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/peter_king/03/05/offseason/index.html|title=As bounty fallout continues, Goodell to make example of Saints|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Chicago Bears]] players and fans believe that the Bears were targets of this program during the second game of the 2011 season, a 30–13 loss to the Saints. Quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] was sacked six times, and nearly lost his voice when a Saints player kicked him in the throat. Later in the game, offensive tackle [[Frank Omiyale]] yanked a Saints defender off Cutler when he saw what he later called "some dirty stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Michael C. |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4675326/bears-wonder-if-saints-targeted-them |title=Bears wonder if Saints targeted them |publisher=[[ESPN|ESPN Chicago]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] quarterback [[Josh Freeman]] reported that the Saints' tendency toward illegal hits was common knowledge among the Tampa Bay coaching staff. Preparations for Saints games included warnings to offensive players to keep their knees protected, especially on plays near the sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, Rick. "Josh Freeman says Tampa Bay Buccaneers were warned about New Orleans Saints' 'cheap shots'". ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''. 6 Mar 2012. [http://www.tampabay.com/sports/football/bucs/josh-freeman-says-tampa-bay-buccaneers-were-warned-about-new-orleans/1218483]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the league revealed that it possessed a [[ledger]] detailing the weekly earnings of the players, which are earned for cart-offs ($1000) and "whacks" ($400) and deducted for "mental errors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Cole|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--sources--new-orleans-saints-kept-a--ledger--detailing-weekly-earnings-in-bounty-scandal.html|title=Sources: New Orleans Saints kept a 'ledger' detailing weekly earnings in bounty scandal|publisher=Sports.yahoo.com|date=2012-06-27|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82982f9f/article/report-saints-ledger-shows-cartoffs-worth-1k?module=HP11_headline_stack|title=Report: Saints Ledger Shows Cart-offs Worth 1K|publisher=NFL.com|date=June 1, 2012|accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on July 26, 2012, Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal."Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty," Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's [[Ed Werder]]. "Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8202975/new-orleans-saints-linebacker-jonathan-vilma-testifies|title=New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma testifies|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/07/new_orleans_saints_linebacker_39.html|title=New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma does not receive restraining order, still hopeful for favorable ruling|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saints All-Pro quarterback Drew Brees made a somewhat controversial tweet on June 20, 2012 stating, "If NFL fans were told there were "weapons of mass destruction" enough times, they'd believe it. But what happens when you don't find any????" Brees immediately issued another statement to clarify, "My WMD comment has nothing to do with politics or our brave military. Merely an analogy to show how media influences public perception." He went on to say, "I apologize if the WMD comment offended anyone. Especially our military. There is no one I respect more than our service men and women."&lt;ref name="klopman1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/drew-brees-wmd-tweet-apologizes-saints-bounty_n_1613163.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Michael|last=Klopman|title=NFL Star Apologizes For Controversial 'WMD' Tweet|date=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other allegations against Williams==
Shortly after the Saints' bounty system came to light, four former [[Washington Redskins]] players, as well as a coach, told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Williams operated a similar system while he was the Redskins' defensive coordinator from 2004 to 2007. The players said that Williams paid his crew thousands of dollars for aggressive play, with the biggest payouts—as much as $8,000—coming for "kill shots" that knocked opposing players out of games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/washington-redskins-offered-bounties-for-big-hits-under-former-assistant-coach-gregg-williams/2012/03/02/gIQAH0RlnR_story.html|title=Washington Redskins offered bounties for big hits under former assistant coach Gregg Williams|last=Maske|first=Mark|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' NFL analyst [[Matt Bowen (American football)|Matt Bowen]], who played for the Redskins at the time, later wrote in one of his regular columns that the bounty pool was funded by fines for mistakes made during practice and in games, and insisted similar systems operated on other teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-0304-bowen-nfl--20120304,0,4015992.column|title=Bounties part of game across the NFL|last=Bowen|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Bowen (American football)|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, ''The Post'' reported that the NFL was investigating the allegations against Williams with the Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/nfl-to-investigate-redskins-over-bounty-allegations/2012/03/03/gIQAwS9XpR_story.html|title=NFL to investigate Redskins over bounty allegations under Gregg Williams|last=Maske|first=Mark|work=The Washington Post|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several former Bills players subsequently told ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' of a similar system during Williams' tenure as Bills' head coach from 2001 to 2003. However, they didn't agree on whether there were rewards for intentionally injuring players. [[Coy Wire]], a safety during Williams' tenure, said that Williams gave bonuses for hits that left opponents seriously injured, and two other players said that bonuses were also awarded for "knockouts." However, linebacker [[Eddie Robinson (linebacker)|Eddie Robinson]], who played for Williams in Houston and Tennessee as well as in Buffalo, acknowledged an incentive pool but said he never heard Williams favor deliberately injuring other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/bills-nfl/article747663.ece|title=Bills had bounty system under Gregg Williams, players say|last=Graham|first=Tim|publisher=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruben Brown]], a guard for the Bills during Williams's time as coach there, denied there was any sort of bounty system in place in Buffalo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wgrz.com/news/article/158807/37/Ruben-Brown-says-Bills-Didnt-Run-Bounty-System Ruben Brown says Bills didn't run bounty system] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120918070810/http://www.wgrz.com/news/article/158807/37/Ruben-Brown-says-Bills-Didnt-Run-Bounty-System |date=2012-09-18 }}.

Former NFL coach [[Tony Dungy]] later told [[Profootballtalk.com]] he was certain that Williams operated a similar bounty system while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. He also believes that Williams put a bounty on [[Indianapolis Colts]] quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low hit from the Redskins' [[Phillip Daniels]] and [[Andre Carter]] and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the [[Denver Broncos]] afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/03/02/dungy-titans-had-a-bounty-on-peyton-manning|title=Dungy: Titans had a bounty on Peyton Manning|last=Florio|first=Mike|publisher=[[Profootballtalk.com]]/[[NBC Sports]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former safety [[Ryan Clark (American football)|Ryan Clark]], who played under Williams in Washington from 2004–2005 and himself was fined by the NFL $40,000 for a helmet-to-helmet hit against [[Baltimore Ravens]] tight end [[Ed Dickson]] during the 2011 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7212307/ryan-clark-pittsburgh-steelers-fined-40k-takes-jab-roger-goodell|title=Ryan Clark of Pittsburgh Steelers fined $40K, takes jab at Roger Goodell|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2011-11-10|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; defended Williams, saying that he never ran a bounty program with the Redskins and has yet to see one during his time in the NFL.

==Aftermath==
Williams, who left after the season to become defensive coordinator of the [[St. Louis Rams]], was summoned to NFL headquarters after the investigation concluded in mid-February. He initially denied any involvement, but recanted and admitted everything in a meeting with Goodell.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt; After the story broke, Williams issued a statement calling his involvement "a terrible mistake." Williams said that he knew all along the slush fund broke the rules, and that "I should have stopped it" rather than get further involved.&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty/&gt; Goodell said in a statement that he found it "particularly disturbing" that the Saints were deliberately trying to injure other players. He said that players and coaches involved in the scheme could face fines or suspensions, and the Saints could be docked picks in the [[2012 NFL Draft]] and future drafts.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty/&gt;

Benson issued a statement on the Saints' Website saying, "I have been made aware of the NFL’s findings relative to the “Bounty Rule” and how it relates to our club.

CBSSports.com's Pat Kirwan [[Twitter|tweeted]] that within hours of the NFL releasing its report, lawyers for several players were already telling him that their clients were considering legal action against the Saints and Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2012/3/2/2840419/new-orleans-saints-bounty-program-lawsuits/in/2604084|title=Players Injured By New Orleans Saints Could Take Legal Action|last=McCauley|first=Kevin|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[San Francisco 49ers]] quarterback [[Steve Young]], who has a law degree from [[J.

However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit Court of Appeals]] disagreed, saying that "the general customs of football" do not include deliberately attempting to injure opposing players.&lt;ref name=FoxLegal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/gregg-williams-new-orleans-saints-bounty-issue-may-have-legal-implications-for-nfl-030812|title=Bounty issue could be NFL legal problem|last=Perez|first=A.

On March 6, Payton and Loomis issued a statement taking "full responsibility" for not stopping the alleged "bounty" program.

On April 5, documentary filmmaker [[Sean Pamphilon]] released audio of a meeting Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back [[Kendall Hunter]], even if it meant hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tear]] wide receiver [[Michael Crabtree]]'s [[anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]], injure tight end [[Vernon Davis]]' ankles and go after kick returner [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]] specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback [[Alex Smith]]; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, "then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, ''I got the first one. I got the first one. Go get it. Go lay that motherfucker out.''" Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on [[Steve Gleason]] and his fight against Lou Gehrig's Disease, released the audio to [[Yahoo!

==Sanctions==
===Coaches and front office staff===
On March 21, 2012, the NFL issued sanctions to Saints coaches and front-office personnel for their roles in the scandal.&lt;ref name="sanction"&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL suspends Saints coach Payton for one year without pay|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827c0dd9/article/nfl-suspends-saints-coach-payton-for-one-year-without-pay?module=HP11_breaking_news|publisher=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USATodayPenalties&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/03/sean-peyton-suspended-saints-fined-for-bounty-program/1#.T2oL-RHS7i0|title=Sean Payton suspended, Saints fined for bounty program|work=USA Today|date=2012-03-21|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Williams was suspended indefinitely, and was banned from applying for reinstatement until the end of the 2012 season at the earliest.
* Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season, effective April 1. He is the first head coach in modern NFL history to be suspended for any reason.
* Loomis was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season.
* Vitt, who had been tabbed as a possible candidate to serve as interim coach in Payton's absence, was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season.&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcsouth/post/_/id/32658/candidates-to-coach-the-saints|title=Candidates to coach the Saints|last=Yasinkas|first=Pat|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This did not automatically disqualify Vitt from serving as interim head coach ''per se'', as his suspension was not effective until the regular season; the suspension terms allowed him to coach the team through training camp and the preseason, then return during Week 7. The Saints announced they would implement this scenario for 2012.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/04/reports-bill-parcells-wont-coach-saints-in-2012/1#.T4Sfr7HJprZ Reports: Bill Parcells won't coach Saints in 2012].

ESPN.com. Retrieved April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saints were also fined $500,000—the maximum fine permitted under the league constitution, and had to forfeit their second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013 (their first-round pick in 2012 had already been traded to the [[New England Patriots]], and therefore, could not be forfeited; after the penalty; the Saints' first pick in the [[2012 NFL Draft]] is a third-rounder)&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement/&gt; He also gave the league's clubs until March 30, 2012 to certify in writing that they do not have bounty programs. Clubs will also be required to certify that no bounty systems exist as part of the yearly certifications they must make under the league's Integrity of the Game Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nflcommunications.com/2012/03/21/all-clubs-directed-to-ensure-no-bounty-programs-exist|title=All clubs directed to ensure no bounty programs exist|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324075858/http://nflcommunications.com/2012/03/21/all-clubs-directed-to-ensure-no-bounty-programs-exist/|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement, Goodell said that the NFL would not tolerate "conduct or a culture" that put player safety at risk. He also said that the fact that the scheme went on for three years demanded that "a strong and lasting message must be sent that such conduct is totally unacceptable and has no place in the game."&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt; He was particularly upset that those involved had lied about the scheme on two separate investigations, and had denied that there was ever a bounty program in place. In an interview with [[NFL Network]]'s [[Rich Eisen]], Goodell said that the threat to player safety, as well as the fact the Saints lied about it, demanded significant punishment. "I don't think you can be too hard on people that put at risk our players' health and safety," Goodell told Eisen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827c28ff/article/goodell-sounds-off-on-saints-bounty-penalties|title=Commissioner Goodell says NFL was misled in 'bounty' probe|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated this in an interview later that day with ESPN's Schefter, saying that the fact those involved "continued to mislead" the league about it was a significant factor in the sanctions. "You have to be accountable and responsible in the NFL," Goodell said. Goodell also implied that Payton would have faced significant punishment in any event, since his contractual obligation to supervise his assistants meant that he at least should have known about the scheme. He also said that there would be zero tolerance for payments for in-game performance in the future, saying that payments for good play eventually escalate to bounties for deliberately injuring players.&lt;ref name=GoodellSchefter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=7719075|title=Goodell talks punishments|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Schefter said on ESPN's [[SportsCenter]] that league officials felt Payton was at least as guilty as Williams, despite initial focus on Williams' role as the mastermind in the scheme.

On March 30, Payton, Vitt and Loomis appealed their suspensions, and the Saints also appealed the fine and loss of draft picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18164762/saints-payton-to-appeal-yearlong-suspension-on-friday|title=Saints, Payton, GM Loomis, assistant Vitt appealing bounty penalties|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payton, Vitt and Loomis met with Goodell on April 5. After that meeting, Vitt's lawyer, David Cornwell, said that Payton and Loomis met with Williams before the divisional playoff game and ordered him to shut down the bounty program immediately. Cornwell contended that Williams was a "rogue coach," and the recently released audio of his meeting with the defense only proved it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8281b86a/article/attorney-for-saints-joe-vitt-says-gregg-williams-went-rogue|title=Attorney for Saints' Joe Vitt says Gregg Williams went 'rogue'|last=Wyche|first=Steve|publisher=NFL.com|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodell denied the appeals on April 9, meaning that Payton's suspension began as of April 16. However, depending on the Saints' cooperation and that of the individuals involved, Goodell could restore the Saints' second-round pick in 2013 (though the Saints would still lose a lower-round pick), as well as reduce the fine on the Saints and restore Payton, Vitt and Loomis' lost pay. However, all appeals were denied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7792405/nfl-upholds-suspension-new-orleans-saints-sean-payton-mickey-loomis-joe-vitt|title=NFL denies Saints' appeals|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players===
The NFLPA requested that the league should hold off on any punishments for the players until it conducts its own investigation.&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement/&gt; Goodell told Schefter, however, that he would hand down punishments to the players involved very soon once he gets feedback from the NFLPA.&lt;ref name=GoodellSchefter/&gt;

Hours after the sanctions were announced, Kluwe went on [[KSTP (AM)|KSTP]] in the Twin Cities and demanded that any players involved in the scheme be severely punished, and that the NFLPA let it be known that "there's no place in the league for that kind of behavior." He even went as far as to call for Vilma—the only player specifically named as being involved in the scheme in the NFL's initial announcements—to be banned from the league for life.&lt;ref name=Zulgad&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.1500espn.com/sportswire/Zulgad_Chris_Kluwe_thinks_Jonathan_Vilma_should_be_banned_from_NFL032212|title=Chris Kluwe thinks Jonathan Vilma should be banned from NFL|last=Zulgad|first=Judd|publisher=[[KSTP (AM)]]|date=2012-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203456/http://www.1500espn.com/sportswire/Zulgad_Chris_Kluwe_thinks_Jonathan_Vilma_should_be_banned_from_NFL032212|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sentiments were echoed a day later by Vikings center [[John Sullivan (American football)|John Sullivan]], who told [[KFXN-FM]] in the Twin Cities that any Saint who deliberately tried to hurt Favre in that game should get a lifetime ban. Sullivan called the Saints' treatment of Favre "despicable" and "the exact opposite of sportsmanship," and even called for the league to take some sort of action against players involved in that game who had since retired, such as McCray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39950/john-sullivan-saints-were-despicable|title=John Sullivan: Saints were "despicable"|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2012, the NFL suspended four then-current or former Saints players for their involvement in the bounty scandal:
* Vilma was suspended for the entire [[2012 NFL season]].&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers" /&gt;
* Former Saints defensive tackle [[Anthony Hargrove]] was suspended for eight games.
* Saints defensive end [[Will Smith (American football)|Will Smith]] was suspended for four games.
* Former Saints linebacker [[Scott Fujita]] (then with the [[Cleveland Browns]], now retired) was suspended for three games.

Vilma's suspension took effect immediately, while the other three players are allowed to attend training camp. In announcing the suspensions, Goodell said that while a large number of players took part in the program, he chose to suspend those players who "were in leadership positions at the Saints; contributed a particularly large sum of money toward the program; specifically contributed to a bounty on an opposing player; demonstrated a clear intent to participate in a program that potentially injured opposing players; sought rewards for doing so; and/or obstructed the 2010 investigation." The NFL determined that Vilma and Smith helped Williams start the bounty program. Hargrove lied to league officials during the 2010 investigation, but later signed a letter to the NFL admitting that he was active participant in the scheme. He also told at least one other player that the Saints had put a bounty on Favre in the 2009 NFC title game. Fujita, who left the team for the Browns immediately after the Saints won [[Super Bowl XLIV]], pledged "a significant amount of money" into the bounty program.&lt;ref name=NFLPlayerPenalties&gt;[http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5-2-12-saints-players1.pdf NFL announcement of player sanctions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, Goodell had indicated that he was going to come down hard on the players involved, telling Eisen that they "enthusiastically embraced" the scheme. "They are on the field, so so I don't think they are absolved from any responsibility because of that," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8288d646/article/goodell-new-orleans-saints-players-embraced-bounties|title=Goodell: New Orleans Saints players 'embraced' bounties|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFLPA released a statement calling the suspensions unjustified, claiming that Goodell had not furnished them with any evidence supporting the sanctions.&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers" /&gt; The union lodged a formal grievance on May 4, contending that since the suspensions were for on-field misconduct, the players' appeals should be heard by [[Ted Cottrell]] and [[Art Shell]], whom the collective bargaining agreement designates as the hearing officers for on-field sanctions. It also contended that since the alleged conduct took place before the most recent CBA was signed in August, Goodell should have deferred to NFL [[special master]] [[Stephen B. Burbank|Stephen Burbank]] in ruling on the players' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18964180/union-bounty-grievance-goodell-has-no-authority-to-punish-hear-appeals|title=Union bounty grievance: Goodell has no authority to punish, hear appeals|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodell issued the suspensions as part of his power to sanction any "conduct detrimental to the integrity and public confidence in the NFL," a violation of Article 46 of the CBA. This provision is normally used to sanction off-field conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/05/new_orleans_saints_suspended_p.html|title=New Orleans Saints suspended players' appeals face uphill battle: expert|last=Varney|first=James|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a league source told CBSSports.com's Judge that it also gives Goodell the power to rule on in-game conduct if he feels that it runs counter to the integrity of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18964610/legal-expert-union-may-be-fighting-losing-battle-in-bounty-grievances|title=Legal expert: Union may be fighting losing battle in bounty grievances|last=Judge|first=Clark|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2012, [[Jonathan Vilma]] and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal. "Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty," Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's Ed Werder. "Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

All four players appealed their suspensions. On September 7, 2012, the Burbank appeals panel vacated the suspensions imposed on the four, and the NFL confirmed that the ruling reinstated them in time for their first games of the 2012 season two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/09/saints-players-have-suspensions-lifted-are-available-for-season-opener/1#.UEpk6rKPUl8|title=Saints bounty players have suspensions lifted, are available for season opener|work=USA Today|accessdate=7 September 2012|date=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the fifth game of the season, on October 9, 2012, the league re-issued the suspensions without any changes or reductions; the players' appeals continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Matt|title=Report: NFL re-issues bounty suspensions for Saints players|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2012/10/09/nfl-re-issues-bounty-suspensions-for-saints-players/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2012, former league commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] postponed the bounty appeals hearing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000085951/article/nfl-postpones-new-orleans-saints-bounty-appeals-hearing|title=NFL postpones New Orleans Saints bounty appeals hearing|publisher=NFL|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; expecting to set a new schedule on October 29, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000085952/article/paul-tagliabue-postpones-bounty-appeals-hearing|title=Paul Tagliabue postpones bounty appeals hearing|publisher=NFL|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, with three games left in the regular season, Tagliabue vacated the players' suspensions, saying in his ruling, "I affirm Commissioner Goodell's factual findings as to the four players. I conclude that Hargrove, Smith and Vilma—but not Fujita—engaged in 'conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football ..." He laid primary responsibility for the scandal on Williams and Payton.&lt;ref name=Tagliabuevacate&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8736662/paul-tagliabue-vacates-new-orleans-players-bounty-penalties Paul Tagliabue vacates penalties]. [[ESPN]], 2012-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Had the suspensions of Vilma and Hargrove been upheld, they would have been the longest for an on-field incident in modern NFL history, topping the previous record set in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], when then-Titans defensive end [[Albert Haynesworth]] was given a five-game suspension for stomping on the head of [[Dallas Cowboys]] offensive lineman [[Andre Gurode]].

Vilma played the final 11 games of the 2012 season for the Saints; Smith played all 16. Fujita played the first four games of the season for the Browns before suffering a season-ending (and ultimately, career-ending) neck injury;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/season-over-browns-lb-scott-163452126--nfl.html|title=Season, maybe career, over for Browns' Fujita|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Nonetheless, the loss of Payton, combined with the distractions caused by the scandal, proved too much for the Saints to overcome. After finishing 13–3 and reaching the Divisional round of the playoffs a year earlier, they finished 7–9 and missed the playoffs.

==Media reaction==
The behavior detailed in the report was almost universally condemned in the press. In an editorial, New Orleans' local paper ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' called the revelations "an embarrassment for one of the most successful and beloved sports organizations of recent years," and that they were "particularly hard to take for (Saints') fans" in light of the Saints' rebound after [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2012/03/bounty_program_scandal_is_a_bl.html|title=Saints 'bounty program' is a black eye for a beloved franchise|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN columnist [[Gregg Easterbrook]] claimed that the Saints' behavior threatened the very integrity of the sport since high school and youth players have long emulated what they see in the NFL. He also claimed that NFL Network yanked its planned replay of the 2009 NFC Championship Game due to concern that fans might look more closely for late hits that should have been called.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook /&gt;

Most of the players who were the targets of questionable hits by the Saints, including Favre and Warner, claimed the bounties were merely part of the game.&lt;ref name="FoxLegal" /&gt; However, several former players interviewed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' said that while payments for good hits and sacks were indeed considered part of the game, bounties for intentionally injuring opponents violated an unwritten code. One of those interviewed, [[Junior Seau]], bluntly said that such practices crossed the line into threatening a person's livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1195696/index.htm|title=The Conscience Of The Locker Room|last=Trotter|first=Jim|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Seau would commit [[suicide]] less than two months after the interview was published; it was discovered after his death that he suffered from [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE) as a result of the numerous head injuries Seau suffered during his 20-year NFL career.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8830344/study-junior-seau-brain-shows-chronic-brain-damage-found-other-nfl-football-players|title=Study: Junior Seau's brain shows chronic brain damage found in other NFL football players|publisher=ESPN.com|date=January 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seau's sentiments were echoed by Hall of Fame quarterback [[Fran Tarkenton]]. In an op-ed for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Tarkenton wrote that he played against the likes of [[Mean Joe Greene]], [[Ray Nitschke]] and [[Dick Butkus]], and none of them even considered deliberately trying to hurt him. He also said that he discussed the issue with several players from his era, and they unanimously agreed that players who put bounties on opponents were "cowards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203370604577265522200050922|title=Football's Bounty Hunters Must Be Clipped|last=Tarkenton|first=Fran|authorlink=Fran Tarkenton|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Seifert, who blogs on the [[NFC North]] for ESPN.com, wrote that neither he nor most Vikings fans were surprised at the discovery of the bounty program. Seifert argued that even before the findings were revealed, it was obvious that the Saints were determined to inflict a severe beating on Favre, even if it meant breaking the rules. The only difference in Seifert's mind was that he no longer believed the Saints were out of control. Rather, he wrote, they were acting as "part of a larger mentality" instilled by Williams.&lt;ref name=Seifert/&gt;

Speculation quickly abounded about how severely Goodell, who has made player safety and the overall integrity of the game a point of emphasis during his six years as commissioner, would punish Williams and the Saints. In his weekly "Monday Morning Quarterback" column on March 5, ''SI''{{'}}s [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] wrote that he believed Williams faced at least an eight-game suspension, and that Payton and Loomis would almost certainly be suspended as well. He also argued that Goodell would have no choice but to come down hard on the Saints, given that the league was facing numerous lawsuits brought by former players who suffered head injuries. Given the circumstances, King said, Goodell had a lot of incentive to "issue a string of suspensions the likes of which the league has never seen."&lt;ref name=KingMarch5/&gt; In an article written for the March 12 edition of ''SI'', King wrote that league officials were so outraged that they were likely to hand down penalties similar to the season-long bans [[Paul Hornung]] and [[Alex Karras]] received in 1963 for gambling.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt; Freeman wrote that his sources in the league office had told him that the players, Williams, Payton and Loomis would all face suspensions of at least six games, as well as heavy fines. Freeman's sources also said that Payton's sanctions were likely to dwarf those handed down to the [[New England Patriots]]' [[Bill Belichick]] in the wake of the [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|2007 "Spygate"]] affair. He also believed that Goodell was going to use the scandal to "end the practice of bounty football forever," much like the penalties imposed against the Patriots after "Spygate" effectively ended the longstanding practice of illicit videotaping.&lt;ref name=Freeman2/&gt;

After the sanctions were announced, CBSSports.com's [[Gregg Doyel]] wrote that the severity of the punishments handed down to Williams, Payton and Loomis proved that Goodell was truly sincere in his desire to "take the thuggishness out of the NFL." Doyel also said that while many players had chafed at what they saw as Goodell's heavy-handed approach to discipline, he was actually standing up for their safety in the Saints' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17950395/long-seen-as-their-enemy-goodell-comes-down-decisively-for-players|title=Long seen as their enemy, Goodell comes down decisively for players|last=Doyel|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Doyel|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pereira, now an analyst for Fox Sports, wrote that based on his experience in the league office, he wasn't surprised that Goodell came down hard on the Saints. He recalled that Goodell was always upset when officials didn't penalize hits on defenseless players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Roger-Goodell-New-Orleans-Saints-Bountygate-proves-commitment-to-player-safety-032212|title=Goodell shows commitment to player safety|last=Pereira|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Pereira|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelation of Williams' pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion. ESPN NFL analyst and former [[Dallas Cowboys]] safety [[Darren Woodson]] said that much of Williams' speech was standard pregame rhetoric. According to Woodson, when Williams called for his men to "attack the head" of running back [[Frank Gore]], he was saying that the 49ers' offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down. However, Woodson felt that several parts of Williams' speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtree's ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:7778213|title=Williams Crossed the Line|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His former teammate, NFL Network analyst [[Michael Irvin]], said that he "almost threw up" when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtree's ACL, saying that players are taught from youth football onward to "never take out a man's knees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/new-orleans-saints/09000d5d8281da6d/Michael-Irvin-s-thoughts-on-Saints-bounties|title=Michael Irvin's thoughts on Saints' bounties|publisher=[[NFL Network]]|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Sports' Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was "woefully underpunished," especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation. He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Gregg-Williams-New-Orleans-Saints-Bountygate-must-be-banned-for-life-040512|title=Ban Williams from NFL for good|last=Kriegel|first=Mark|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL Network analyst [[Michael Lombardi (sportscaster)|Michael Lombardi]] wrote that the scandal happened in part because during Williams' previous stops as a defensive coordinator, the head coaches under which he worked—Fisher, [[Joe Gibbs]] and Payton—essentially ceded him complete authority over the defense. Lombardi claimed that as a result, Williams operated essentially as "an independent contractor." Lombardi argued that such a situation is "never fully sustainable," as it can easily lead to the head coach losing control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82821ba1/article/williams-independentcontractor-status-fueled-rogue-mentality|title=Williams' independent-contractor status fueled rogue mentality|last=Lombardi|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Lombardi (sportscaster)|publisher=[[NFL.com]]|date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the media outcry, an independent study speculated that Saints' players may have pretended to participate off the field but not put the tactics into action on the field. "If the Saints tended to injure more players, then teams that played them would tend to list more injuries the following week. To test whether the Saints injured more players than a typical team, one need only compare the number of players added to injury reports after a Saints game to the league-wide average. Did the New Orleans Saints injure more players? The data-driven answer is a resounding 'no.' The Saints appear to have injured far fewer players over the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. The numbers are striking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aei.org/article/economics/the-saints-aint-sinners/|title=The Saints ain't sinners|last1=Hassett|first1=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Hassett|last2=Veuger|first2=Stan|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2016}}
'''No goal''' is a call made by [[referee]]s in various [[Goal (sport)|goal]]-scoring sports ([[soccer|football]], [[hockey]], [[lacrosse]], etc.) to indicate that a goal has not been scored. It is commonly used to disallow an apparent goal, such as when the ball or puck has entered the net but should not count as a score due to some foul or infraction.

Because the decision often depends on a subjective assessment by the referee, and especially if the score might be critical, such calls can be hotly contested. For fans of one of the teams involved, it may thus refer to a goal that was actually disallowed, or one that in their opinion should have been disallowed, but was not. As a result, in recent years most professional sports leagues have implicated protocol allowing for such calls to be subject to video review or to be reviewed because of a [[coach's challenge]].

== National Hockey League (NHL) ==
In the [[NHL]] a goal may be called a no goal for the following reasons: 
# When the puck has been directed, batted or thrown into the net by an attacking player other than with a stick.
# (ii)  When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion.
# (iii)  When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official.
# (iv)  When a goal has been scored and an ineligible player is on the ice.
# (v)  When an attacking player has interfered with a goalkeeper in his goal crease.
# (vi)  When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor. See 38.4(vi).
# (vii)  When video review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed.
# (viii)  When a Linesman reports a double-minor penalty for high-sticking, a major penalty or a match penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending team, the goal must be disallowed and the appropriate penalty assessed.
# (ix)  When a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save. See also 69.6.
# (x)  When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.
# (xi)  During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending team cannot score unless the non-offending team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending player or any physical action by an offending player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending team.
# (xii)  When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if he had not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing his whistle.
# (xiii) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2014-2015-rulebook.pdf|title=NHL Rulebook Rule 78.5|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Lacrosse League (NLL) ==
According to the [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] rulebook (Rule 55: No Goal) a goal may be disallowed under the following conditions:

# (55.1) When the ball passes through the plane of the net after the game clock’s horn or shot clock has sounded to indicate the end of a quarter or overtime period or expiration of the shot clock.
# (55.2) A crease violation will result in a no goal. Crease violation is rule 69.
# (55.3) When the ball passes through the plane of the goal when the attacking team has too many players on the floor including those in the penalty box at the time of the play.
# (55.4) When the ball passes through the plane of the goal after one of the officials has sounded his whistle for any reason, including the sounding of an inadvertent whistle.
# (55.5) When the player makes contact with the goalie. See Contact While Shooting on Net Rule 69.
# (55.6)  When the ball passes through the plane of the goal from a stick that is found to be illegal by a stick check.
# (55.7)  When the ball is kicked in a kicking motion directly or indirectly into the opponent’s goal.
# (55.8)  When the ball is directed into the net off the free hand of an opponent.
# (55.9)  When a ball is lodged, or not, in the throat of the pocket and the ball and stick is inadvertently or deliberately tossed into the goal.
# (55.10) In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net by his teammate on his own accord and the ball crosses the goal line after making the stop, the goal will be allowed. In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net by an opponent and the ball crosses the goal line after making the stop, the goal will be disallowed. The plays are subject to any appropriate penalties.
# (55.11) If the ball is loose in the crease an opposing  player may not direct the ball into the goal. If the ball is loose in the crease, an opposing player must have possession prior to any scoring attempt. A no goal shall be called if the ball is loose in the crease, directed by an opposing player and having the ball make contact with the goalie or a defender prior to the ball going into the net.
# (55.12) If a goal is scored when an ineligible player is on the floor, the goal will be disallowed. The ineligible player will be removed from the game and the club shall not be able to substitute another player on its roster. An ineligible player is a player who had been previously ejected from the game, and subject to league discipline.
# (55.13) If a goal is scored when the attackers’ stick head is behind the goal line extended when releasing the ball during the act of shooting, the goal will be disallowed.
# (55.14) If a player takes a shot and the head of his stick comes off and the ball enters the goal, the goal would be disallowed and the ball awarded to the goalie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/nllassets/2016+NLL+Rulebook.pdf|title=NLL Rulebook Rule 55|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''omnium''' (from Latin: of all, belonging to all) is a multiple race event in [[track cycling]]. Historically the omnium has had a variety of formats.  In recent years, road racing has also adopted the term to describe multi-day races that feature the three primary road race events ([[time trial]], mass start and [[criterium]]).

==History==
The omnium was re-introduced into the World Championships as a five race track cycling format [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Men's omnium|for men]] in 2007 and [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Women's omnium|for women]] in 2009. The omnium was changed in 2010 by the UCI to include the elimination race and the distances of the events were lengthened to favour endurance cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Birnie|first=Lionel|title=Olympic omnium format unveiled|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/435675/olympic-omnium-format-unveiled.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Cycling Weekly|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The omnium replaced the [[individual pursuit]], the [[points race]], and the [[Madison (cycling)|Madison]] at the [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] beginning in [[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]. The change received some criticism from cyclist [[Rebecca Romero]], who was left unable to defend her Olympic title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romero and Wiggins lose out in Olympic cycling shake-up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/8403854.stm|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=BBC Sport: Cycling|date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current omnium==
[[File:Ciclismo de pista (28395640743).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Omnium scratch race at the [[Rio Olympics]]]]
From June 2014 until the end of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ Rule Changes Track June 2014|url=http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/52/70/RulechangestrackJune2014-ENG_English.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the omnium as defined by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) consisted of the following six events held over 2 days:

# [[Scratch race]]
# [[Individual pursuit]]
#: 4,000 metres for elite men, 3,000 metres for junior men and elite women, and 2,000 metres for junior women
# [[Elimination races#Miss and out|Elimination race]]
# [[Track time trial|Time trial]]
#: 1&amp;nbsp;km men, 500 metres women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 6 Kilometre and 500 metres Time Trial|url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTkzNg&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=NDk3OTg&amp;LangId=1|work=Part 3: Track Races|publisher=UCI Cycling Regulations|page=21|accessdate=6 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806032756/http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTkzNg&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=NDk3OTg&amp;LangId=1|archivedate=6 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Flying lap (against the clock)
# [[Points race]]
#: 40&amp;nbsp;km for elite men, 25&amp;nbsp;km for elite women, 25&amp;nbsp;km for junior men, 20&amp;nbsp;km for junior women

For the first five events, each winner was awarded 40 points, each second place 38 points, each third place 36, etc.  Riders ranked 21st and below will each be awarded 1 point.
In the Points Race, riders add to and lose points from their totals based on laps gained and lost, and points won in sprints.

After the 2016 season, the three timed events - the sprint time trial, flying lap and individual pursuit were all removed from the event, a [[Points race#Tempo|tempo race]] added, and the event shortened to a  single day. The points race as final race format remains with minor modifications.

# [[Scratch race]]
# [[Elimination races#Miss and out|Elimination race]]
# [[Points race#Tempo|Tempo race]]
# [[Points race]]
#: 25&amp;nbsp;km for elite men, 20&amp;nbsp;km for elite women, 20&amp;nbsp;km for junior men, 15&amp;nbsp;km for junior women

The winner of the Omnium is the rider who has obtained the highest total of points.

In the event of a tie in the final ranking, the places in the final sprint of the last event,
the Points Race, breaks the tie. 

A rider must have completed every event in the omnium.

==Road racing omnium==
A road race omnium consists of a [[time trial]], a [[criterium]], and a [[Bike race|mass-start road race]] - typically held across a weekend or other 2-3 day period.  Points are awarded to the top finishers at each event and totaled at the end of the event.  The overall winner for the event is chosen based on the number of accumulated points.  Often, organizers will stipulate that riders must complete each event in order to qualify for the overall prize.

'''Palace of Sports''' or '''Sports Palace''' ({{lang-ru|Дворец спорта}}) is the name of comprehensive indoors [[sports venue]]s introduced in the [[Soviet Union]] (compare with [[Palace of Culture]]) and still used in a number of [[post-Soviet states]]. Many of them had standard architectural design. Some of them were renamed, e.g., into '''Palace of Concerts and Sports'''.

The term is also used in other countries. For example, in [[Hispanophone]] countries, the term is '''Palacio de los Deportes'''.

'''Carlos''' "'''Panama'''" '''Lewis''' (born November 4, 1945) is an American [[boxing]] trainer. He was convicted of tampering with the gloves of [[Luis Resto (boxer)|Luis Resto]] in the Resto vs "Irish" [[Billy Collins, Jr.|Billy Collins]] fight of 1983, which subsequently led to the end of Collins' boxing career. Collins suffered from depression and possibly committed suicide following the tragic assault.&lt;ref name="The Independent: Boxing: Notorious trainer's presence taints Tyson's new image"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawton|first1=James|title=Boxing: Notorious trainer's presence taints Tyson's new image|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing-notorious-trainers-presence-taints-tysons-new-image-179085.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=5 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early career==
Lewis was a disciple of trainer Chickie Ferrara.  He was [[Roberto Durán]]'s [[cornerman]] when Duran lost a unanimous decision against [[Wilfred Benitez]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;[[Jeff Pearlman|Pearlman, Jeff]].  [https://www.si.com/vault/1998/10/26/8102058/bare-knuckles-the-night-billy-collins-fought-luis-resto-something-was-terribly-wrong-with-restos-gloves-the-beating-collins-took-cost-him-his-careerand-maybe-his-life Bare Knuckles].   ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', October 26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, he was considered one of the best trainers of his time, compared with [[Emanuel Steward]] and [[Lou Duva]].  The most noted boxer in his stable was light-welterweight champion [[Aaron Pryor]]. In 1982, Pryor fought [[Alexis Argüello]]. Before the fourteenth round, a cornerman held up a plastic water bottle, but [[HBO]] cameras caught Lewis yelling,  "Not that bottle, the one I mixed."  Pryor knocked out Arguello, but Lewis' comments fueled rumors that the bottle contained [[stimulant]]s.  Lewis said it only contained [[Perrier]] and tap water, in line with rules allowing boxers to consume only water in the ring.  Although Lewis was never formally sanctioned, the incident sullied his reputation, which was confirmed by his cheating discovered in subsequent fights.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; 

It was later alleged in an interview with former Lewis-trained boxer [[Luis Resto (boxer)|Luis Resto]] in the HBO documentary film ''[[Assault in the Ring]]'', that Lewis would break apart pills used to treat [[asthma]] and pour the medicine into the water, giving Resto greater lung capacity in the later rounds of a fight.

==Resto-Collins controversy==

The most notorious incident in Lewis's career took place on June 16, 1983. A fighter he was training, [[Luis Resto (boxer)|Luis Resto]], was fighting undefeated prospect [[Billy Collins (boxer)|Billy Collins, Jr.]] in a bout televised by [[ABC's Wide World of Sports]].  The fight was the [[undercard]] for a fight between [[Roberto Durán]] and [[Davey Moore (1980s)|Davey Moore]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Resto won in a 10-round unanimous decision over a bloody Collins.  After the fight, Resto came to Collins' corner to shake hands with Collins' father and trainer, Billy Sr.  When Billy Sr. grabbed Resto's hand, he discovered Resto's gloves were thinner than normal.  Screaming that he thought the gloves had no padding, Collins Sr. demanded that the [[New York State Boxing Commission]] impound the gloves.  An investigation found that each glove was missing an ounce of padding.  There was also a 0.75-inch hole in the palm of each glove.  Collins suffered a torn [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and permanently blurred vision, ending his boxing career.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

After an investigation, the New York State Boxing Commission determined Lewis had tampered with the gloves.  On July 1, 1983, it permanently revoked Lewis' state boxing license.  Since most state boxing commissions honor sanctions imposed by other states, this action had the effect of banning Lewis from ever having another official role in an American bout.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;  Resto's win was subsequently changed to a [[no contest (combat sports)|no contest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=22083&amp;cat=boxer Luis Resto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1986, Lewis and Resto were both put on trial and found guilty of assault, criminal possession of a weapon (Resto's hands) and conspiracy.  Lewis was also found guilty of tampering with a sports contest.  Prosecutors charged that since Lewis had deliberately removed the padding from Resto's gloves, the bout with Collins amounted to an illegal assault.  Lewis was sentenced to six years in prison, Resto to three years. Lewis was released from prison in 1990.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farhood, Steve. [http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0003/two.htm Unforgiven] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305042019/http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0003/two.htm |date=March 5, 2008 }}.  Boxing Monthly, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins died on March 6, 1984, when he crashed his car into a culvert near his home in [[Antioch, Tennessee]]. Many think he may have committed suicide because he was unable to continue boxing as a result of the actions of Lewis and Resto.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Years later, during the filming of the documentary ''Assault in the Ring'', Resto admitted that he knew Lewis had not only tampered with the gloves, but had also dipped his [[hand wraps]] in [[plaster of Paris]], dramatically—and illegally—increasing his punching power.  He also said that Lewis had taken the padding out of his gloves on at least two other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Mladnich, Robert.  [http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/5801/resto-comes-clean-knew-gloves-were-loaded/ Resto Comes Clean:  He Knew Gloves Were Loaded] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415141819/http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/5801/resto-comes-clean-knew-gloves-were-loaded/ |date=April 15, 2008 }}.  ''The Sweet Science'', April 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also alleged by Resto that the plot centered around a large amount of money bet on Resto, the underdog, by a third party who had met with Lewis prior to the fight.

Lewis maintains his innocence to this day, and many of his defenders allege that someone removed the padding from Resto's gloves ''after'' the bout.  For instance, an official with the New York State Boxing Commission left the gloves in his car after receiving them from the state boxing commission.  However, this is belied by pictures of Collins' face after the bout; it was badly swollen, and many felt it was improbable a light puncher like Resto could have inflicted such damage on his own.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

When confronted by Resto and ''Assault in the Ring'' director and producer Eric Drath, Lewis again denied any wrongdoing and said that it was cornerman Artie Curley who had wrapped Resto's hands. An agitated Lewis said that if Curley were alive today, "none of this would have happened to him."

[[Image:Greek vase with runners at the panathenaic games 530 bC.jpg|thumb|Greek vase depicting runners at the Panathenaic Games c. 530 BC]]

The '''Panathenaic Games''' ({{lang-grc|Παναθήναια}}) were held every four years in [[Athens]] in [[Ancient Greece]] from 566 BC&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of the Olympic Games by David C. Young, Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-1129-4}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; to the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Heuck Allen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8vyYn-qMgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39 Finding the walls of Troy: Frank Calvert and Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlík], University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-520-20868-4}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; These Games incorporated religious festival, ceremony (including prize-giving), athletic competitions, and cultural events hosted within a [[stadium]].

==Religious festival==

The competitions for which this festival came to be known were only part of a much larger religious occasion; the Great Panathenaia itself. These ritual observances consisted of numerous sacrifices to Athena (the name-sake of the event and patron deity to the hosts of the event - Athens) as well as Poseidon and others. The Panathenaic festival was formed in order to honor the goddess Athena who had become the patron of Athens after having a competition with the god Poseidon where they were to win the favor of the Athenian people by offering the people gifts. The festival would also bring unity among the people of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldstein|first1=Charles|title=The Panathenaic Festival and the Central Slab of the Parthenon Frieze|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|date=1885|volume=1|issue=1|pages=10–17|doi=10.2307/495977|ref=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sister-event to the Great Panathenaia was held every year - the Lesser Panathenaia, which was 3–4 days shorter in celebration. The competitions were the most prestigious games for the citizens of [[Athens]], but not as important as the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] or the other [[Panhellenic Games]].

==Ceremony==

The procession to the [[Parthenon]] was more important than the games themselves. During the Great Panathenaia, a special robe (the ''[[peplos]]'') was made by the women of Athens for the statue of [[Athena]], which was carried to the Parthenon as part of the procession. There was also a large sacrifice made to Athena, the ''hekatombe'' ("sacrifice of a hundred oxen") and the meat from the sacrificed animals was used in an enormous banquet on the final night of the festival, the ''pannychis'' (Greek παννυχίς, "all-nighter").  Many scholars believe that this procession is the theme of the inner Ionic [[Parthenon Frieze]], highlighting its importance to the Athenian people to warrant inclusion in a temple.

Award ceremonies included the giving of [[Panathenaic amphora]]e which were the large ceramic vessels that contained the oil given as prizes.  The winner of the [[chariot race]] received as a prize one-hundred and forty Panathenaic amphorae full of olive oil.

== Cultural events ==

The Panathenaia also included poetic and musical competitions.  Prizes were awarded for [[rhapsode|rhapsodic]] recitation of [[Homer]]ic poetry, for instrumental music on the [[aulos|aulus]] and [[cithara]], and for singing to the accompaniment of the aulus and cithara ([[citharede|citharody]]). In addition, the Games included a reading of both the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]''.

==The Panathenaic Stadium==

The athletic events were staged at the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], which is still in use today. In 1865, [[Evangelis Zappas]] left a vast fortune in his will with instructions to excavate and refurbish the ancient Panathenaic stadium so that modern Olympic Games could be held every four years "in the manner of our ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The Panathenaic stadium has hosted Zappas Olympics in [[Zappas Olympics#Games of 1870|1870]],&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, Chapters 4 &amp; 13&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zappas Olympics#Games of 1875|1875]], as well as the modern [[Olympic Games]] in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]. The stadium also hosted the [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906]] [[Intercalated Games]].

== Contests ==
The Panathenaic Games held contests in a number of musical, athletic, and equestrian events. Due to the fact that there were so many contests held, the games usually lasted a little over a week. On a fourth century marble block, experts explain that on the block is written a program for the games, as well as individual events and their prizes. The inscription also says that there are two age categories for the music events but three age categories for the athletic events. According to scholars, the age groups are boys: 12-16; beardless youths: 16-20; men: over 20.&lt;ref name=Neils&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neils|first1=Jennifer|title=Goddess and Polis: The Panathenanic Festival In Ancient Athens|date=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thing that was different about these games than normal funeral games is that prizes were given to runners-up, not just the lone victor.

Using the inscription, experts put together a general program like so: Day 1: Musical and Rhapsodic Contest; Day 2: Athletic Contest for Boys and Youths; Day 3: Athletic Contest for Men; Day 4: Equestrian Contest; Day 5: Tribal Contest; Day 6: Torch Race and Sacrifice; Day 7: Boat Race; Day 8: Awarding of Prizes, Feasting and Celebrations.&lt;ref name=Neils/&gt; Experts reasonably came up with how the games went based on the order of prizes which were written on the marble block. Wrestling was also a part of the contest as well as discus.

The musical events which took place were Kithara players, Flute players, and singers. The athletic events were the stadion, pentathlon, wrestling, boxing, and pankration. The equestrian events were two-horse chariot race, horse race, and javelin throw on horseback. Based on the inscription, we learn that the prizes given to the men and the youth were different. Men were rewarded a certain amount of drachmas and/or a valuable crown worth a certain amount of drachmas. Boys and youths were given a certain number of amphoras of olive oil.&lt;ref name=Neils /&gt;

[[Image:Rugby socks.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]

'''Rugby socks''' are similar to the long [[socks]] that are worn in other sports such as [[association football|football (soccer)]]. They are intended to be worn pulled up just below the [[knee]] and cover the shins and calves and are designed to be hardwearing.

==Construction==
The foot part of the rugby sock is generally thick but breathable so as to fit snugly into the rugby boot and provide comfort during training and matches. They have padded heel-and-toe constructions with comfortable and absorbent cushioned soles. Rugby socks were traditionally made from cotton. Outer portions are made of tough [[nylon]], with the uppers being made from soft elasticised [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]] or [[polyester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pickyguide.com/sports_and_recreation/rugby_socks_guide.html|title=Guide to Rugby Socks|publisher= pickyguide.com|accessdate=01/06/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may use more advanced materials to allow for more comfort and to reduce swelling of the feet or excessive sweating, keeping the feet warm but dry while playing.

==Fit==
Socks should be well fitting. This can help to prevent rubbing and any [[blisters]] that may arise from poor fitting socks.

==Colours==
As part of a kit, the rugby sock will often match the [[away colours|colours]] of the team and may have the team's [[logo#Sports|logo]] stitched onto the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;

==Manufacturers==
[[Canterbury of New Zealand]] is the most popular producer of rugby kit. [[Kooga]] are a very popular supplier, particularly to [[rugby league]] teams.

'''''SpecTrek'''''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spectrekking.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[augmented reality]] [[ghost]] hunting game. The [[game]] won second prize in the "[[Android Developer Challenge#Android Developers Challenge II|Android Developer Challenge II]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.spectrekking.full |title=SpecTrek - Android app |publisher=Appbrain.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; lifestyle category.

SpecTrek was designed to have the user work-out whilst playing the game, the tag line for the game is "protect the world, stay in shape". There are three default games to play, short which lasts 15 minutes, medium which lasts for 30 minutes, and long which lasts for 60 minutes. SpecTrek projects ghosts at various locations on a [[Google map]] in either a predetermined search radius or a user defined search radius. To play the user must walk to these [[ghosts]], if within range the user can scan and find out what kind of ghost is nearby as well as how far said ghost is from their current position. If the user is unable to reach a ghost, a horn may be blown which makes all nearby ghosts flee and possibly stop within reach of another accessible location.

The user catches ghosts by tilting their phone to the "camera-position". Through the [[camera]] the user can scan the ghosts, see the ghosts in augmented reality and of course catch the ghosts.

The '''[[European Union]]''' plays a minor and mostly indirect policy role in '''sport''', because (a) sport is normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union and (b) sport is in general organised  internally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally.

==Role of the EU==
=== Direct ===

The European Union has a very limited direct role in sport. The [[European Commission]] is composed of Directorates-General and several departments. Within the [[Directorate-General]] Education and Culture, is the Sport Unit, which is responsible for the following main areas:
* cooperation within the Commission and with other institutions on sport-related issues,
* cooperation with national and international sports institutions, organisations and federations,
* bilateral meetings with sports institutions and organisations and international sports federations. [http://ec.europa.eu/sport/index_en.htm]

One of the few specific measures in Sports was taken by Decision No. 291/2003/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 6 February 2003 that established the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.

The activities and initiatives undertaken during 2004 were organised at Community, transnational, national, regional and local level, and was sometimes co-financed by the Community. Activities compromised for instance financial support for transnational, national, regional or local initiatives to promote education through sport. [http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l35008.htm]

===Indirect===
Although not directed specifically at sport, many of the rules, policies and programmes of the European Union affect the sports world or are of interest to it.

In particular, the [[common market]] of the European Union creates the right for any EU citizen to move and work freely in another member state.  The landmark [[Bosman ruling]] confirmed that this right, when applied to professional athletes, forbids nationality quotas in sports leagues that affect EU citizens.  This has changed the face of professional sports in the EU, with top teams now collecting talent from all over Europe, and sometimes even fielding teams with no domestic players at all.

The term '''sports memorabilia''' usually refers to a souvenir, memento, keepsake or token of remembrance that is directly connected to a famous athlete, sporting event or personality. These items are generally collected by fans that find sentimental and/ or monetary value of the item(s). There is no set parameter regarding the number of items, type of sport, or even the era that an item may reflect. A piece of certain kind may be considered a [[collectable]] item.

==Monetary value==
Items that have been in direct contact with a famous athlete can have significant monetary value. Game used items such as the ball which [[Mark McGwire]] hit for his 70th home run of the 1998 season sold for $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://tech.mit.edu/V119/N3/homerun.3w.html&lt;/ref&gt; The most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold, a [[New York Yankees]] baseball jersey worn by [[Babe Ruth]] during the 1920 season, sold for $4,415,658 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upcomingautographsignings.com/2012/05/most-expensive-piece-of-sports.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the ten most valuable [[sports cards]] and memorabilia sold for a record-setting combined $12,186,294.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seideman|first1=David|title=In 2016 The Top 10 Most Valuable Sports Cards And Memorabilia Commanded A Record $12 Million+|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidseideman/2016/12/29/in-2016-top-10-most-valuable-sports-cards-and-memorabilia-command-record-12-million/#2b2f7b8b132b|accessdate=24 April 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autographed pieces of memorabilia are usually more valuable that non-autographed items. Items that have been personalized (i.e. "To Mark," Best Wishes Travis," or "Happy Birthday John") can add sentimental value. Collectors who are interested in purchasing sports memorabilia often look for a [[certificate of authenticity]]. Several companies have developed systems to prove authenticity of game-used or autographed memorabilia, and collectors will generally seek out dealers that offer a lifetime, money-back, authenticity guarantee.

The value of a signed item will generally be relative to the profile of the signer and the scarcity of similar items. When a high-profile sports star dies, the value often rises as there will no longer be an opportunity to get more. For example, the death of [[Muhammad Ali]] in 2016 raised both demand and prices for signed Muhammad Ali memorabilia.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
It could be said that collecting sports memorabilia goes back to the first decades of the 20th century, when many people would collect baseballs from [[baseball]] games and many asked [[Babe Ruth]] for [[autograph]]s. As years passed and many other sports stars joined their sports, memorabilia collectors also began to broaden their horizons.

When the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], [[MLB]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[National Football League|NFL]] began selling their jerseys in stores during the 1980s, game used jerseys also became a hot item among sports memorabilia collectors. Former NBA player [[Dennis Rodman]] was famous for taking off his jerseys and throwing them to the stands after his games were over. [[Michael Jordan]] is probably the [[basketball]] player whose memorabilia is most sought after by collectors.

The highest price fetched for a [[football (soccer)]] match worn shirt is $224,000.  The shirt belonged to the legendary [[Pelé]], who wore it during the 1970 World Cup final in which Brazil went on to win. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3020876/Peles-shirt-goes-for-record.html|title=The Telegraph|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular items==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Collectors like to look back in time when they are finding sports memorabilia. Items such as [[John L. Sullivan]] and [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] fight posters have sold well before. There is also a [[boxing]] glove signed by Sullivan, Johnson, Ruth and many [[Hollywood]] stars and American Presidents that has sold for a lot of money before. This glove is now on display at the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]].

Other popular items in sports memorabilia are "game-used" items.  Game used can refer to an item worn on the field during a game, worn during the pregame, or by a player on the bench.  These can include jerseys, pants, caps, helmets, gloves, shoes, or even sunglasses.  Game Used can also refer to bats, balls, turf, flags, or other items used by a player on in the stadium.  In NASCAR, and other forms of automobile racing, the metal from the cars, the tires, the driver uniforms, and the crew uniforms are popular collectables. Concrete from the various racetracks are also popular. Trunks (shorts or pants), used by popular boxers such as [[Greg Haugen]] in boxing fights are also popular and sometimes sell for 100 dollars or more.

In Europe, football (soccer) memorabilia is the largest market, with high-profile players shirts, boots and photos in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exclusivememorabilia.com/|title=Exclusive Memorabilia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Event programme]]s from [[rugby union]] and [[football (soccer)]] matches are also highly collectable.

[[File:New York Red Bulls vs CD FAS (15264450902).jpg|thumb|right|262px|Squad number, as depicted on the association football jersey of [[Tim Cahill]].]]
'''Squad numbers''' are used in [[association football]] to identify and distinguish players that are on the field. [[number (sports)|Numbers]] were originally used to also indicate position, with starting players being assigned numbers 1–11, although these numbers often bear little or no significance in the modern game other than the players' favourite numbers and the numbers available. However, numbers 1–11 are often still worn by players of the previously associated position.&lt;ref name=sports.yahoo.com&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/mystery-solved--why-do-the-best-soccer-players-wear-no--10-052229677.html|title=Mystery solved: Why do the best soccer players wear No. 10?|publisher=Yahoo|author1=Khalil Garriot|date=21 June 2014|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As national leagues adopted squad numbers and game tactics evolved over the decades, numbering systems evolved separately in each football scene, and so different countries have different conventions. Still, there are some numbers that are universally agreed upon being used for a particular position, because they are quintessentially associated with that role.&lt;ref name=sports.yahoo.com/&gt;

For instance, "1" is frequently used by the starting [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], as the goalkeeper is the first player in a line-up.&lt;ref name=sports.yahoo.com/&gt; It is also the only position on the field that is required to be occupied. "10" is one of the most emblematic squad numbers in football, due to the sheer number of football legends that used the number 10 shirt; [[playmaker]]s, [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]]s and [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]]s usually wear this number.&lt;ref name=sports.yahoo.com/&gt; "7" is often associated with effective and profitable [[Midfielder#Winger|wingers]] or second strikers.&lt;ref name=sports.yahoo.com/&gt; "9" is usually worn by [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre forward]]s or [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]], who hold the most advanced offensive positions on the pitch, and are often the highest scorers in the team.&lt;ref name=sports.yahoo.com/&gt;
[[File:Cristiano Ronaldo 20120609.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] displaying his squad number (7), as portrayed on his [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]] jersey.]]
[[File:2015_UEFA_Super_Cup_97.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lionel Messi]] displaying his squad number (10), as portrayed on his [[FC Barcelona]] jersey.]]
[[File:Zarya-MU_(4).jpg|thumb|right|[[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] displaying his squad number (9), as portrayed on his [[Manchester United]] jersey.]]

A particular squad number can be strongly attached to a certain player, leading to comparisons being drawn with anyone subsequently assigned that number at the same club. Some clubs have retired squad numbers as a way of honouring the player who last used it; usually a player who has made a significant contribution to the success of the club. This is normally done to mark the player in question's retirement or death.

==First use of numbers==
The first documented instance of numbers being used in association football was on 30 March 1924 when the [[Fall River Marksmen]] played [[St. Louis Vesper Buick]] during the [[1923–24 National Challenge Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6zdZqbAFpE|title=1924 U.S. Open Cup Final Fall River @ Vesper Buick (St. Louis)|first=|last=soccermavn|date=16 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time numbers were used in association football in Europe was 25 August 1928 when [[Sheffield Wednesday]] played [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-wear-numbered-shirts "Gunners wear numbered shirts"], Arsenal.com, 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] hosted [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. Numbers were assigned by field location:

#[[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeeper]]
#[[Fullback (association football)|Right full back]] (right side centre back)
#[[Fullback (association football)|Left full back]] (left side centre back)
#[[Wing half|Right half back]] (right side defensive midfield)
#[[Centre half|Centre half back]] (centre defensive midfield)
#[[Wing half|Left half back]] (left side defensive midfield)
#[[Outside forward|Outside right]] (right winger)
#[[Inside forward|Inside right]] (attacking midfield)
#[[Centre forward]]
#[[Inside forward|Inside left]] (attacking midfield)
#[[Outside forward|Outside left]] (left winger)

In the first game at Stamford Bridge, only the outfield players wore numbers (2–11). ''[[The Daily Express]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;13, 27 August 1928) reported, "The 35,000 spectators were able to give credit for each bit of good work to the correct individual, because the team were numbered, and the large figures in black on white squares enabled each man to be identified without trouble." ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' ("Numbered Jerseys A Success", p.&amp;nbsp;29, 27 August 1928) also covered the match: "I fancy the scheme has come to stay. All that was required was a lead and London has supplied it." When Chelsea toured Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil at the end of the season in the summer of 1929, they also wore numbered shirts, earning the nickname "''Los Numerados''" ("the numbered") from locals.

Early evolutions of formations involved moving specific positions; for example, moving the centre half back to become a defender rather than a half back. Their numbers went with them, hence central defenders wearing number 5, and remnants of the system remain to this day. For example, in friendly and championship qualifying matches [[England national football team|England]], when playing the 4–4–2 formation, generally number their players (using the standard right to left system of listing football teams) four defenders – 2, 5, 6, 3; four midfielders – 7, 4, 8, 11; two forwards – 10, 9. This system of numbering can also be adapted to a midfield diamond with the holding midfielder wearing 4 and the attacking central midfielder wearing 8. Similarly the Swedish national team number their players: four defenders – 2, 3, 4, 5; four midfielders – 7, 6, 8, 9; two forwards – 10, 11.

In Brazil, the 4–2–4 formation was developed independently from Europe, thus leading to a different numbering – here shown in the 4–3–3 formation to stress that in Brazil, number ten is midfield:

*1 Goleiro (Goalkeeper)
*2 Lateral Direito (right wingback)
*3 Beque Central (centre back)
*4 Quarto Zagueiro (the "fourth defender", almost the same as a centre back)
*6 Lateral Esquerdo (left wingback)
*5 Volante ("Rudder" or "mobile", the defensive midfielder)
*8 Meia Direita (right midfielder)
*10 Meia Esquerda (left midfielder, generally more offensive than the right one)
*7 Ponta Direita (right winger)
*9 Centro-Avante (centre forward)
*11 Ponta Esquerda (left winger)

When in 4–2–4, number 10 passes to the Ponta de Lança (striker), and 4–4–2 formations get this configuration: four defenders – 2 (right wingback), 4, 3, 6 (left wingback); four midfielders – 5 (defensive), 8 ("second midfielder"), similar to a central midfielder), 7, 10 (attacking); two strikers – 9, 11

[[Image:Formation evolution.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Evolution from 2–3–5 to 4–4–2]]
In England, in a now traditional 4–4–2 formation, the standard numbering is usually: 2 (right fullback), 5, 6, 3 (left fullback); 4 (defensive midfielder), 7 (right midfielder), 8 (central/attacking midfielder), 11 (left midfielder); 10 (second/support striker), 9 (striker). This came about based on the traditional 2–3–5 system. Where the 2 fullbacks retained the numbers 2, 3. Then of the halves, 4 was kept as the central defensive midfielder, while 5 and 6 were moved backward to be in the central of defence. 7 and 11 stayed as the wide attacking players, whilst 8 dropped back a little from inside forward to a (sometimes attacking) midfield role, and 10 stayed as a second striker in support of a number 9. The 4 is generally the holding midfielder, as through the formation evolution it was often used for the sweeper or libero position. This position defended behind the central defenders, but attacked in front – feeding the midfield. It is generally not used today, and developed into the holding midfielder role.

When [[Substitute (association football)|substitutions]] were introduced to the game in 1965, the substitute typically took the number 12; when a second substitute was allowed, they wore 14. Players were not compelled to wear the number [[13 (number)|13]] if they were [[Triskaidekaphobia|superstitious]].

In Eastern Europe, the defence numbering is slightly different. The [[Hungary national football team|Hungarian national team]] under [[Gustav Sebes]] switched from a 2–3–5 formation to 3–2–5. So the defence numbers were 2 to 4 from right to left thus making the right back (2), centre back (3) and the left back (4). Since the concept of a flat back four the number (5) has become the other centre back.

In continental Western Europe this can generally be seen:

*1  [[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeeper]]
*2 [[Fullback (association football)|Right full back]]
*4 [[Centre half|Centre half back]]
*5 [[Centre half|Centre half back]]
*3 [[Fullback (association football)|Left full back]]
*6 [[Midfielder|Defensive Midfielder]]
*8 [[Midfielder|Central Midfielder]]
*10 [[Midfielder|Attacking Midfielder]]
*7 [[Winger (association football)|Right Winger]]
*9 [[Forward (association football)|Striker]]
*11 [[Winger (association football)|Left Winger]]

This changes from formation to formation, however the defensive number placement generally remain the same. The use of [[Inverted Winger|inverted wingers]] now sees traditional right wingers, the number 7's, like [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], on the left, and traditional left wingers, the number 11's, like [[Gareth Bale]], on the right.

===Argentina===
Argentina developed its numeration system independently from the rest of the world. This was due to the fact that until the 1960s, Argentine football developed more or less isolated from the evolution brought by English, Italian and Hungarian coaches, owing to technological limitations at the time in communications and travelling with Europe, lack of information as to keeping up with news, lack of awareness and/or interest in the latest innovations, and strong nationalism promoted by the [[Asociación del Fútbol Argentino]] (for example, back then Argentines playing in Europe were banned from playing in the Argentine national team).

The first formation used in Argentine football was the '''2–3–5''' and, until the '60s, it was the sole formation employed by Argentine clubs and the [[Argentina national football team]], with only very few exceptions like [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]'s ''La Máquina'' from the '40s that used '''3–2–2–3'''. It wasn't until the mid '60s in the national team, with Argentina winning the [[Taça das Nações]] (1964) using '''3–2–5''', and the late '60s, for clubs, with [[Club Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]] winning the treble of the [[Copa Libertadores]] (1968, 1969, 1970) using '''4–4–2''', that Argentine football finally adopted modern formations on major scale, and caught up with its counterparts on the other side of the Atlantic.

While the original '''2–3–5''' formation used the same numbering system dictated by the English clubs in 1928, subsequent changes were developed independently.

The basic formation to understand the Argentine numeration system is the '''4–3–3''' formation, like the one used by the coach [[César Menotti]] that made Argentina win the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], the squad numbers employed are:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 4 Right Back &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/blog_detalle.php?id_post=646%7CSalvemos|title=Salvemos al 4: la desaparición de los laterales|author=|date=|website=www.elgrafico.com.ar|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2 First Centre Back / Sweeper
* 6 Second Centre Back / Stopper
* 3 Left Back&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/2007/08/24/333633-el-lateral-izquierdo-una-especie-extincion%7cEl|title=lateral izquierdo, ¿una especie en extinción?|author=|date=|website=infobae.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 8 Right Midfielder
* 5 Central Defensive Midfielder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejatodoodejaelfutbol.obolog.es/numero-5-volante-tapon-mediocampista-central-284902%7cEl|title=número 5: Volante tapón-mediocampista central|author=|date=|website=obolog.es|accessdate=4 April 2018}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10 Left Midfielder
* 7 Right Winger
* 9 Centreforward
* 11 Left Winger

However, in a '''4–3–1–2''' like those used by the multichampion teams of [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] in the 1980s and [[Boca Juniors]] in the 2000s, the use of an ''enganche'' (playmaker) and the re-accommodation of other roles changes the numbers:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 4 Right Back
* 2 First Centre Back
* 6 Second Centre Back
* 3 Left Back
* 8 Right Midfielder
* 5 Central Defensive Midfielder
* 11 Left Midfielder
* 10 Playmaker
* 7 Second Striker
* 9 Centreforward

When using a '''4–4–2''' like that of the multichampion [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] of the 1960s or the Argentine national team that became runners-up in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], the numbers are the same as in '''4–3–3''', except that the [[box-to-box midfielder]] may have any number. In Argentina, the role is called ''doble 5'' so there isn't any fixed convention as to which number it has. Also, due to the use of just two strikers, the number 11 may not be used at all. So, the numbers are:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 4 Right Back
* 2 First Centre Back / Sweeper
* 6 Second Centre Back / Stopper
* 3 Left Back
* 8 Right Midfielder
* 5 Central Defensive Midfielder
* # Box-to-box Midfielder (may have any number)
* 10 Left Midfielder
* 7 Second Striker
* 9 Centreforward

Then there is the '''4–2–3–1''' formation, ubiquitous at world-level in the 2010s, and employed in Argentina by the national team nicknamed ''Los 4 Fantásticos'' that finished first in CONMEBOL [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2014 World Cup qualifying]], attacking with the forwards [[Sergio Agüero]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Ángel Di María]] and [[Gonzalo Higuaín]]. The numbers used are:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 4 Right Back
* 2 First Centre Back
* 6 Second Centre Back
* 3 Left Back
* 8 Midfielder
* 5 Central Defensive Midfielder
* 7 Right Winger
* 10 Playmaker
* 11 Left Winger
* 9 Centreforward

Meanwhile, the '''3–5–2''' formation, famously used by the coach [[Carlos Bilardo]] to make Argentina win the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] and become runners-up in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], and one of the last major changes in the history of football formations, changes drastically the use of numbers, due to major movements in roles and positions:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 2 Sweeper
* 4 Right Stopper
* 6 Left Stopper
* 8 Right Wing-Back
* 7 Right Central Midfielder
* 5 Central Defensive Midfielder
* 11 Left Central Midfielder
* 3 Left Wing-Back
* 10 Playmaker / Second Striker
* 9 Centreforward

And, last, the '''3–3–3–1''', used by the coach [[Marcelo Bielsa]] to help Argentina finish first in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|CONMEBOL's 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]], become runners-up in the [[2004 Copa América]] and win the gold medal in the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2004 Olympics]]. It was also employed by the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentine under-20 team]] that won the [[2015 South American Youth Football Championship]]. '''3–3–3–1''' uses mixtures from many of the aforementioned formations:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 2 Sweeper
* 4 Right Stopper
* 6 Left Stopper
* 8 Right Wing-Back
* 5 Central Defensive Midfielder
* 3 Left Wing-Back
* 7 Right Winger
* 10 Playmaker
* 11 Left Winger
* 9 Centreforward

===United Kingdom===
In 1993, [[The Football Association]] (The FA) switched to persistent squad numbers, abandoning the mandatory use of 1–11 for the starting line-up. The first league event to feature this was the [[1993 Football League Cup Final]] between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and it became standard in the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] the following season, along with names printed above the numbers.

Squad numbers became optional in the three divisions of [[The Football League]] at the same time, but only 10 out of 70 clubs utilized them. One of those clubs, [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], issued 25 players with squad numbers but reverted to traditional 1–11 numbering halfway through the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegoldstonewrap.com/tag/ron-pavey/|title=ron pavey - The Goldstone Wrap|author=|date=|website=thegoldstonewrap.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Premier League, Arsenal temporarily reverted to the old system halfway through that same season, but reverted to the new numbering system for the following campaign.

Most European top leagues adopted the system during the 1990s.

The Football League made squad numbers compulsory for the [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000 season]], and the [[Football Conference]] followed suit for the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]].

The traditional 1–11 numbers have been worn on occasions by English clubs since their respective leagues introduced squad numbers. Premier League clubs often used the traditional squad numbering system when competing in domestic or European cups, often when their opponents still made use of the traditional squad numbering system. This included [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s Premier League clash with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at [[Old Trafford]] on 10 February 2008, when 1950s style kits were worn as part of the [[Munich air disaster]]'s 50th anniversary commemorations.

[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] were among the ten Football League clubs who chose to adopt squad numbers for the 1993–94 season (with squad numbers assigned to players in alphabetical order according to their surname), before reverting to 1–11 shirt numbering a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://squadnumbers.wordpress.com/2014/10/14/1-11-in-the-premier-league-era/|title=1-11 in the Premier League era|author=|date=14 October 2014|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players may now wear any number (as long as it is unique within their squad) between 1 and 99. To date, the highest number worn by a player in the Premier League is 78, by Manchester City's [[José Ángel Pozo]] against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 3 December 2014. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/30204459|title=Sunderland 1-4 Manchester City|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bigger teams have a tendency to field reserve and fringe players in the [[EFL Cup|English Football League Cup]] so high squad numbers are not uncommon. [[Nico Yennaris]] wore 64 for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the competition on 26 September 2012 in a match against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19645217|title=Arsenal 6–1 Coventry|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 24 September 2014, again in the League Cup, Manchester City forward José Ángel Pozo wore the number 78 shirt in a match against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29233053|title=Manchester City 7–0 Sheffield Wednesday|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In The Football League, the number 55 has been worn by [[Ade Akinbiyi]], for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://stokecity.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=944&amp;p=2&amp;stid=8302149 Rivals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040926151836/http://stokecity.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=944&amp;p=2&amp;stid=8302149 |date=26 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dominik Werling]], for [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/2007/09/crazy_squad_num.html|title=Crazy squad number XI - Who Ate all the Pies|author=|date=|website=Who Ate all the Pies|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sunderland signed Cameroonian striker [[Patrick Mboma]] on loan in 2002, he wanted the number 70 to symbolize his birth year of 1970. The Premier League refused, however, and he wore the number 7 instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Players are not generally allowed to change their number during a season, although a player may change number if he changes clubs mid-season. Players may change squad numbers between seasons.  Occasionally, when a player has two loan spells at the same club in a single season (or returns as a permanent signing after an earlier loan spell), an alternative squad number is needed if the original number assigned during the player's first loan spell has been reassigned by the time the player returns.

A move from a high number to a low one may be an indication that the player is likely to be a regular starter for the coming season. An example of this is [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]'s [[Scott McDonald]], who, after the departure of former number 7 [[Maciej Żurawski]], was given the number, a move down from 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celticfc.net/news/stories/news_100708165942.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917133824/http://celticfc.net/news/stories/news_100708165942.aspx |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Steven Gerrard]], who wore number 28 (which was his academy number) during his debut [[1998–99 Liverpool F.C. season#Squad|1998–99 season]], then switched to number 17 in [[2000–01 Liverpool F.C. season#First-team squad|2000–01]]. In [[2004–05 Liverpool F.C. season#First-team squad|2004–05]], after [[Emile Heskey]] left Liverpool, Gerrard then changed his number again to 8. More recently, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] striker [[Harry Kane]] changed his number 37 shirt from the [[2013–14 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season#First-team squad|2013–14 season]] to 18 for the [[2014–15 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2014–15 season]] when he became one of the club's first-choice strikers after Jermain Defoe was sold and the number 18 was vacated.  Kane then switched to the number 10 for the 2015-16 season after Emmanuel Adebayor left the club and the number was vacated. Manchester City's [[Sergio Agüero]] also did a similar switch in jersey number, from number 16 in [[2014–15 Manchester City F.C. season|2014–15]] to number 10 in [[2015–16 Manchester City F.C. season|2015–16]], a number he took over from [[Edin Džeko]] following his loan departure to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]].

Some players keep the number they start their career at a club with, such as Chelsea defender [[John Terry]], who has worn the number 26 from when he became part of the first-team squad. On occasion, players have moved numbers to accommodate a new player; for example, Chelsea midfielder [[Yossi Benayoun]] handed new signing [[Juan Mata]] the number 10 shirt, and changed to the number 30, which doubles his "lucky" number 15.&lt;ref name="Deco's Top 20"&gt;{{cite news

In a traditional 4–4–2 system in the UK, the squad numbers 1–11 would usually have been occupied in this manner:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 2 Right back
* 3 Left back
* 4 Central midfielder (more defensive)
* 5 Centre back
* 6 Centre back
* 7 Right winger
* 8 Central midfielder (more attacking)
* 9 Centre forward (usually a target player)
* 10 Striker (usually a fast poacher)
* 11 Left winger

However, in a more modern 4–2–3–1 system, they will be arranged like this:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 2 Right back
* 3 Left back
* 4 Central midfielder (more defensive)
* 5 Centre back
* 6 Centre back
* 7 Right winger
* 8 Central midfielder (box-to-box)
* 9 Striker
* 10 Central midfielder (more attacking)
* 11 Left winger

===France===
In France, players must be registered between numbers 1-30, with 1, 16 and 30 reserved for goalkeepers and 33 left empty for extra signings. In case a fourth goalkeeper has to be registered, he wears number 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/football/mario-balotelli-nice-jersey-squad-number-rule-345995|title=Hate Mental Squad Numbers?

===Italy===
In 1995, the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) also switched to persistent squad numbers for [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B]] (second division), abandoning the mandatory use of 1–11 for the starting lineup. After some years during which players had to wear a number between 1–24, now they can wear any number between 1–99 without restrictions. Notably, [[Chievo Verona]] had the goalkeeper [[Cristiano Lupatelli]] wearing number 10 from 2001 to 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/25759/no-10-shirt-downsized|title=No 10 shirt downsized - Football Italia|author=|date=|website=www.football-italia.net|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and midfielder [[Jonathan De Guzman]] wearing number 1 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2942637/jonathan-de-guzman-to-wear-no-1-at-chievo|title=Jonathan De Guzman to wear the No.1 shirt at Chievo|author=|date=|website=espnfc.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In the Spanish [[La Liga]], players in the A-squad (maximum 25 players, including a maximum of three [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]]) must wear a number between 1–25. Goalkeepers must wear either 1, 13 or 25. When players from the reserve team are selected to play for the first team, they are given squad numbers between 26 and 50.

===U.S.-Canada===
North American professional club soccer follows a model similar to that of European clubs, with the exception that many American and Canadian clubs do not have "reserve squads", and thus do not assign higher numbers to those players.

Most American and Canadian clubs have players numbered from 1 to 30, with higher numbers being reserved for second and third goalkeepers. In the [[United Soccer Leagues]] First Division and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), there were only 20 outfield players wearing squad numbers higher than 30 on the first team in the 2009 season, suggesting that the traditional model has been followed.

In 2007, MLS club [[LA Galaxy]] retired the former playing number of [[Cobi Jones]], number 13, becoming the first MLS team to do so.

In 2011, MLS club [[Real Salt Lake]] retired the former playing number of coach [[Jason Kreis]], number 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2011-07-05/real-salt-lake-retires-jason-kreis-number-in-unprecedented-move|title=Real Salt Lake retires Jason Kreis' number in unprecedented move|date=5 July 2011|publisher=AOL Sporting News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goalkeeper numbering==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
[[File:Hope in San Jose.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hope Solo]] displaying her squad number (1), as portrayed on her [[United States women's national soccer team|US national team]] jersey.]]
The first-choice goalkeeper is usually assigned the number 1 shirt as he or she is the first player in a line-up.&lt;ref name=sports.yahoo.com/&gt;.

The second-choice goalkeeper wears, on many occasions, shirt number 12 which is the first shirt of the second line up, or number 13. In the past, when it was permitted to assign five substitute players in a match, the goalkeeper would also often wear the number 16, the last shirt number in the squad. Later on, when association football laws changed and it was permitted to assign seven substitute players, second-choice goalkeepers often wore the number 18. In the [[A-League]], second-choice goalkeepers mostly wear number 20, based on that competition have a 20-man regulated "first team" squad size.

In international tournaments (such as FIFA World Cup or continental cups) each team must list a squad of 23 players, wearing shirts numbered 1 through 23. Thus, in this case, third-choice goalkeepers often wear the number 23. Prior to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], only 22 players were permitted in international squads; therefore, the third goalkeeper was often awarded the number 22 jersey in previous tournaments.

The move to a fixed number being assigned to each player in a squad was initiated for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] where each man in a country's 22-man squad wore a specific number for the duration of the tournament. As a result, the numbers 12 to 22 were assigned to different squad players, with no resemblance to their on-field positions. This meant that a team could start a match not necessarily fielding players wearing numbers one to eleven. Although the numbers one to eleven tended to be given to those players deemed to be the "first choice line-up", this was not always the case for a variety of reasons – a famous example was [[Johan Cruyff]], who insisted on wearing the number 14 shirt for the Netherlands.

In the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]] forgot to send the player numbers list to the event organization. However, the Uruguayan official Lorenzo Villizzio assigned random numbers to the players. The [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Gylmar dos Santos Neves|Gilmar]] received the number 3, and [[Garrincha]] and [[Zagallo]] wore opposite winger numbers, 11 and 7, while [[Pelé]] was randomly given the number 10, for which he would become famous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mienet.com/sports/soccer/2006world_cup/documents/3C75E9E67D775FA74B27B6F7C1DD3A6EE2BD3EE4.html Soccer and World Cup Trivia &amp; Curiosities], Mienet.com.

[[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] defied convention by numbering their squads for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] World Cups alphabetically, resulting in outfield players (not goalkeepers) wearing the number 1 shirt (although [[Diego Maradona]] was given an out-of-sequence number 10 in 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/teams/team=43922.html|title=Argentina squad 1982 World Cup|author=|date=|website=fifa.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[England national football team|England]] used a similar alphabetical scheme for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], but retained the traditional numbers for the goalkeepers (1, 13 and 22) and the team captain (7), [[Kevin Keegan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/CmpWC/CmpWC1982Squad.html|title=England in the World Cup - 1982 Final Squad|first=Peter|last=Young|date=|website=www.englandfootballonline.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], [[1990 FIFA World Cup squads#Scotland|Scotland]] assigned squad numbers according to the number of international matches each player had played at the time (with the exception of goalkeeper [[Jim Leighton]], who was assigned an out-of-sequence number 1): [[Alex McLeish]], who was the most capped player, wore number 2, whereas [[Robert Fleck]] and [[Bryan Gunn]], who only had one cap each, wore numbers 21 and 22, respectively. In a practice that ended after the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] gave low squad numbers to defenders, medium to midfielders, and high ones to forwards, while numbers 1, 12 and 22 were assigned to goalkeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1013/teams/team=43954.html|title=Italy squad 1998 World Cup|author=|date=|website=fifa.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=84/teams/team=43954.html|title=Italy squad 1994 World Cup|author=|date=|website=fifa.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2007, a [[FIFA]] document issuing regulations for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] finally stated that the number 1 jersey must be issued to a goalkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/fifa%5fwc%5fsouth%5fafrica%5f2010%5fregulations%5fen%5f14123.pdf|title=Regulations of 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa (point 4 of Article 26)|author=|date=|website=fifa.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA) attempted to retire the number 10 in honour of Maradona by submitting a squad list of 23 players for the tournament, listed 1 through 24, with the number 10 omitted. FIFA rejected Argentina's plan, with the governing body's president [[Sepp Blatter]] suggesting the number 10 shirt be instead given to the team's third-choice goalkeeper, [[Roberto Bonano]]. The AFA ultimately submitted a revised list with [[Ariel Ortega]], originally listed as number 23, as the number 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*Goalkeeper [[Jan Jongbloed]] unusually wore the number 8 jersey for [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. He was assigned the number in 1974 when the Netherlands took an alphabetical approach to its squad numbering (striker [[Ruud Geels]] was assigned the number 1). In 1978, although this alphabetical approach was not used, many of the squad retained their 1974 numbers (goalkeeper [[Piet Schrijvers]] wore number 1).
*From [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]] to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]]'s numbers for [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s were mostly assigned alphabetically, leading to unusual numbers being assigned for goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] (number 5 in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and 7 in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]]), [[Héctor Baley]] (number 3 in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and 2 in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]]) and [[Enrique Vidallé]] (number 3 in [[1979 Copa América|1979]]), with number 1 being assigned to offensive players: [[Norberto Alonso]] in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[Sergio Omar Almirón|Sergio Almirón]] in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]].

[[File:Pinagbuyutan Private Beach.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman wearing a [[G-string]] style thong]]

The '''thong''' is a [[Clothing|garment]] generally worn as either [[underwear]] or as a [[swimsuit]] in some countries. It may also be worn for traditional [[Ceremony|ceremonies]] or [[Sport|competitions]].

Viewed from the front, the thong typically resembles a [[bikini]] bottom, but at the back the material is reduced to a minimum. Thongs are almost always designed to cover the [[genitals]], [[anus]], and [[perineum]], and leave part or most of the [[buttocks]] uncovered. The back of the garment typically consists of a thin waistband and a thin strip of material, designed to be worn between the buttocks, that connects the middle of the waistband with the bottom front of the garment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/thong |title=Thong| publisher=Merriam-Webster |work=Online Dictionary|accessdate=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a descriptive term in other types of garment, such as a [[bodysuit]], [[bodystocking]], [[leotard]], or one-piece swimsuit in the context "thong backed".

One type of thong is the [[G-string]], the back of which consists only of a (typically elasticized) string.&lt;ref&gt;Hydinger, Liss "[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF6153ABB456E98&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Listen up, guys, here's a lingerie lingo lesson]", ''Daily News of Los Angeles'', 6 February 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The two terms ''G-string'' and ''thong'' are often used interchangeably; however, they can refer to distinct pieces of clothing. Thongs come in a variety of styles depending on the thickness, material, or type of the rear portion of fabric and are available for both men and women throughout most of the world.

== Nomenclature ==
The origin of the word ''thong'' in the English language is from [[Old English]] ''thwong'', a flexible leather cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/thong |title=Merriam-Webster online dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages borrow the English word ''string'' to refer to this type of underwear, usually without the ''G''. Another common name is ''[[Tanga (clothing)|tanga]]'' (or sometimes ''string tanga''), especially in the German ''Tanga''. A frequent metaphor, especially in Brazil, is dental floss; in Brazil a thong is called ''fio dental'' (Portuguese for dental floss); in English, the term "Butt floss" is sometimes used. In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] it is "siaurikės" ("narrows"), Italian "perizoma"  or "tanga", in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] "ipli külot" ("stringed underpants"), and in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] as "prashka" ({{lang|bg|прашка}}), which means a slingshot. In [[Israel]] the thong, mostly the G-string, is called ''Khutini'' ({{lang|he|חוטיני}}), from the word Khut, which means String. Similarly, in [[Iran]], it is called "Shortbandi" ({{lang|fa|شورت بندی}}) in which "short" (from English: Shorts) means "briefs" and "bandi" means "with a string". A [[Puerto Rican Spanish]] slang term, used by [[Reggaeton]] artists, is ''gistro''. Australians often colloquially refer to the ''G-string'' as a ''g-banger'' or simply ''banger''.

Some names for the thong reference the bareness of the buttocks, as seen in the Spanish word ''colaless'' (the origin is probably connected to the term topless but in reference to ''cola'', colloquial term for butt in South American Spanish), and in other names the "T"-like shape of the back is highlighted. In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the T-back is commonly called ''dingziku'' (丁字褲/丁字裤) which literally means ''丁 character pants'' (or roughly, ''T-letter pants''). In Korean, it is called 티팬티 (''T panty''). However, there are several usages of the term T-back in English as well (e.g., children's literature author [[E. L. Konigsburg]]'s ''T-backs, T-shirts, Coat and Suit'').

=== Thong vs. G-string ===

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion'', "The G-string, or thong, [is] a panty front with a half- to one-inch strip of fabric at the back that sits between the buttocks",&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Valerie (2005) ''Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons {{ISBN|0-684-31396-0}}; p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Knickers: a Brief History'' says: "Minor tweaks to the cut earned these skimpy panties different titles—from the thong, which has a one-inch strip of fabric down the back, to a G-string, which, as the name equivalent of Spanish suggests (hilo dental), is more like a string of fabric akin between the teeth."&lt;ref&gt;Tomczak, Sarah &amp; Pask, Rachel (2004) ''Knickers: a Brief History''. London: Allen &amp; Unwin {{ISBN|1-74114-480-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Striptease: the Untold History of the Girlie Show'' says: "The thong [is] an [[undergarment]] derived from the stripper's G-string",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steir|first=Rachel|year=2004|title=Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPwVfOUWAe0C|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195127508|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to ''Americanisms: the Illustrated Book of Words Made in the USA'' a G-string is "a thong panty consisting of a small triangular piece of fabric supported by two elastic straps.

== History ==
The thong, like its probable predecessor the [[loincloth]], is believed to be one of the earliest forms of human clothing and is also thought to have been worn mostly or exclusively by men. It is thought the thong was probably originally developed to protect, support, or hide the male genitals. The loincloth is probably the earliest form of clothing used by mankind, having originated in the warmer climates of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] where clothing was first worn nearly 75,000 years ago. Many tribal peoples, such as some of the [[Khoisan]] people of southern Africa, wore thongs for many centuries. Much like the Japanese [[fundoshi]], these early garments were made with the male genitalia in mind.

According to some fashion historians, the first public appearance of the thong in the United States was at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. This resulted from [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], the [[Mayor of New York City]], ordering the city's nude dancers to cover themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lessons in Lingerie: Finding Your Perfect Shade of Seduction|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tS9T3Xf5B_gC|first=Rebecca |last=Apsan|publisher=Workman Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9780761175018|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Heim's and Louis Réard's original [[bikini]] from 1946 (that introduced the term ''bikini'') had a [[culotte]] with a thong back.

[[File:Thong (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Woman wearing a T-back thong in [[Sunrise, Florida]], US in 2006]] 
Attitudes toward the wearing of g-strings vary geographically and across societies, as is usual with highly revealing clothing. Prior to its entrance into mainstream fashion, g-strings were primarily worn by exotic dancers. In the modern Western world, g-strings are more commonly marketed towards females but are worn by both sexes. During the 1980s, thongs were worn on stage by pop stars such as [[Cher]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name=cracks&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Good riddance to the thong! After decades of discomfort, women have finally cracked |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/good-riddance-to-the-thong-after-decades-of-discomfort-women-hav/ |date=18 September 2017 |author=Claire Cohen|newspaper=The Telegraph |location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late-1980s, the style (for females) had made its way into most of the Western world; thong underwear became more popular through the 1990s due to TV shows such as: ''[[Baywatch]]'', where numerous females were recorded wearing thong swimsuits.

In the 1990s, the thong began to gain wider acceptance and popularity in the United States as underwear (and, to a lesser extent, as swimwear), especially with women, but also men. In the USA and Europe, the wearing of thongs by men was once mainly limited to the [[dance belt]], the posing pouch for [[bodybuilders]] and the realm of male [[strippers]]. Men's thongs are now more widely available and commonly worn as day-to-day underwear or swimwear. While some major retailers such as [[Kmart]] sell men's thongs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmart.com/joe-boxer-men-s-thong-underwear-4-pack/p-99900600zo287000P?prdNo=9&amp;blockNo=9&amp;blockType=G9|title=Kmart.com|work=kmart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are not marketed as strongly to men as they are to women. In Europe, thongs have been commonplace for many more years both as underwear and swimwear.

In the 2000s, some people wore thongs with low-cut hipsters and deliberately exposed them over the top of their trousers, producing an effect popularly known as a [[whale tail]]. This led to many thong designs intended to be worn in this manner, which were adorned with jewels and motifs on the back. In the early-2000s, thongs made up 31% of the women's underwear market.&lt;ref name=cracks/&gt; However, in the late-2000s, the exposure of a thong above one's trousers became less popular and the trend turned to the wearing of lower-riding thongs that hardly show above trousers, except when bending or twisting.

[[Market research]] in 2011 placed the number of French women who wear thongs as their preferred underwear style at 25%, down by 5% from 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male and female views on underwear|url=http://www.womenology.com/reflexions/male-female-views-underwear/|website=Womenology|publisher=[[aufeminin]]|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L'avenir du string compromis face aux shorties et aux tangas|url=http://www.terrafemina.com/vie-privee/sexo/articles/10229-lavenir-du-string-compromis-face-aux-shorties-et-aux-tangas.html|work=[[:fr:Terrafemina|Terrafemina]]|date=15 January 2012|language=French|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, sales of thongs in the UK were on the decline with [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], a major UK lingerie retailer, reporting that they made up fewer than 10% of knickers sold.&lt;ref name=cracks/&gt; Many reasons exist as to why people may choose to wear thong underwear or swimwear, such as prevention of [[panty line|visible panty lines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Wallis |first=Claudia |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005821,00.html?internalid=ACA |title=The Thing About Thongs: Why the bottom line has become a battleground for parents of tweens |magazine=Time |date=6 October 2003 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; prevention of underwear "riding up" so one need not pull at one's underwear in public, comfort, fashion consciousness including the feeling of being more adult,&lt;ref name=cracks/&gt; and minimization of tan lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Would You Dare to Wear a Thong Bikini to the Beach?|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/fashion-trends-thong-bikini-kendall-jenner-bella-hadid|magazine=Vogue|date=28 July 2017|author=Brooke Bobb|quote=...it is the perfect suit to avoid unnecessary tan lines.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of thongs include the traditional thong, the G-string, and the C-string. There are a number of intermediate kinds of thongs between full rear coverage and a string rear. As designs become more risqué there are also types intended to expose genitals as much as they conceal them. Other styles include the Cheeky, V-string, T-front and T-back. The naming of the intermediate styles of thong is debatable, different vendors use the words somewhat interchangeably. Thongs are available in a wide variety of materials, including silk, [[latex]], cotton, [[microfiber]], [[satin]], nylon, and [[spandex|lycra/spandex]]. There are also novelty designs for both sexes, featuring shapes to conform to the genitals or provide humorous visual effects.

The most significant difference between thongs designed for men and women is the shape of the front part of the garment. Often, but not always, thongs for men will feature a vertical seam to create shape and space for the male genitalia, and the pouch may be made of stretchy material (usually cotton-Lycra or microfiber) for an ergonomic fit. The equivalent section in women's thongs is normally flat and seamless. However, the fabric is usually thicker in the area where it covers the [[vulva]] (by incorporating a cotton [[gusset]]).

=== {{anchor|G-string}} G-string ===
{{Main|G-string}}

The G-string style consists of an elastic string (also a narrow piece of cloth, [[leather]], or [[plastic]]) that connects the front/pouch and the waistband at back, worn as [[swimsuit|swimwear]] or underwear mostly by women, but also by men. Since the mid-1920s, strippers and exotic dancers in the West have been referring to the style of thongs they wore for their performances as G-strings.

==== Etymology ====

The origin of the term ''G-string'' is obscure.  It may simply stand for 'Gusset' as the G-String is in effect just a gusset on a string. Since the 19th century, the term ''geestring'' referred to the string which held the loincloth of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]&lt;ref name="p. 249"&gt;Beadler, John Hanson (1877) "Western Wilds, and the Men who Redeem Them: an authentic narrative" [https://books.google.com/books?id=W-gTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=geestring p. 249], digitized text at [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; and later referred to the narrow loincloth itself. [[William Safire]] in his ''Ode on a G-String'' quoted the usage of the word ''G-string'' for loincloth by ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' 15 years after Beadle's and suggested that the magazine confused the word with the musical term ''G string'' (i.e., the [[string (music)|string]] for the G note). Safire also mentions the opinion of linguist Robert Hendrickson that "G" (or "gee") stands for [[groin]], which was a [[taboo word]] at the time.&lt;ref name="On Language; Ode on a G-String"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DF173CF937A3575BC0A967958260 "On Language; Ode on a G-String"], by William Safire, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 August 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History ====

The g-string first appeared in costumes worn by showgirls in [[Earl Carroll]]'s productions during the [[Jazz Age]]. Linguist Robert Hendrickson believes that the 'g' stands for 'groin'.&lt;ref name="Shteir2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Shteir|title=Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPwVfOUWAe0C&amp;pg=PA202|accessdate=10 March 2013|date=1 November 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512750-8|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' reports that the G-string was originally a narrow strip of fabric worn by Indian women. During the Depression, a "G-string" was known as "the gadget".&lt;ref name="Shteir2004" /&gt; During the 1930s, the "Chicago G-string" gained prominence when worn by performers like [[Margaret Hart Ferraro|Margie Hart]]. The Chicago area was the home of some of the largest manufacturers of G-strings and it also became the center of the [[burlesque]] shows in the United States.&lt;ref name="Shteir2004" /&gt;

==== {{anchor|C-string}} C-string ====
As narrow as a G-string, but without the supporting "string" around the wearer's hips/panty line, leaving just a sideways ''C'' shaped piece between the legs.  This is held in place firmly by a flexible internal frame.  Since there is no material around the waist, the C-string completely eliminates the [[panties|panty lines]] which thongs and other underwear create.  C-strings are also designed for use as [[beachwear]], which reduces the [[tan lines]] that would have been left by the side straps of even a G or V-String.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-458818/Forget-G-string--ANYONE-wear-new-C-string.html | work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London | title=Forget the G-string – can ANYONE wear the new C-string? | author=Alice Smellie | date=31 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cheeky ====
A more conservative style called a cheeky covers a little more area, but exposes the bottom part of the buttocks. Some cheekies are used as undergarments while others function as bikini bottoms.

==== {{anchor|T-front}} T-front ====
A type of G-string in which the string reaches also the front part. It provides no coverage while still maintaining the basic hygienic underwear functions. Usually it is built by strings only, sometimes with more fabric or lace around the waist. Certain designs cover the string with pearls for decoration and stimulation reasons.&lt;ref name="completefashion"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://completefashion.org/pearls-gone-wild-can-you-rock-the-single-strand-pearl-thong/|title=Pearls Gone Wild: Can You Rock The Single Strand Pearl Thong?|magazine=Complete Fashion|author=Cynthia Ejike|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kowpeenam ====
{{Main|Kowpeenam}}
Kaupinam is a thong worn in India, by some men as a [[loincloth]] or [[underclothing]]. It is made up of rectangular strip of cotton cloth which is used to cover the genitals with the help of the strings connected to the four ends of the cloth for binding it around the waist of the wearer.  It is used by wrestlers in the game of Kushti or traditional Indian Wrestling in the Akhaada (Wrestling Ring) and also during practice sessions and training.

==== Fundoshi ====
{{Main|Fundoshi}}
Fundoshi is the traditional [[Japan]]ese undergarment for adult males, made from a length of [[cotton]]. Before [[World War II]], the fundoshi was the main form of underwear for Japanese adult males. However, it fell out of use quickly after the war with the introduction of new underwear to the Japanese market, such as [[briefs]] and [[boxer briefs|trunks]]. Nowadays, the fundoshi is mainly used not as underwear but as festival (''[[matsuri]]'') clothing at [[Hadaka Matsuri]] or, sometimes, as swimwear.

There are many other varieties of fundoshi as the variations on the principle of a loincloth are almost infinite. For example, the ''mokko-fundoshi'' (literally "earth-basket loincloth" because it looks like the traditional baskets used in construction) is made like the etchyuu-fundoshi but without a front apron; the cloth is secured to the belt to make a bikini effect. The ''kuro-neko fundoshi'' (literally "black cat fundoshi") is like the ''mokko-fundoshi'' except that the portion that passes from front to back is tailored to create a thong effect.

==== Jockstrap ====
{{Main|Jockstrap}}
A jockstrap (also known as a jock, jock strap, strap, supporter, or athletic supporter) is an undergarment designed for supporting the [[human male reproductive system|male genitalia]] during sports or other vigorous physical activity. It was created by Chicago sporting goods company Sharp &amp; Smith in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHytBAAAQBAJ|first1=Michael|last1=Kimmel|first2=Christine|last2=Milrod|first3=Amanda|last3=Kennedy|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2014|isbn=9780759123144|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically it is not a thong, as there is no narrow strap that passes up between the buttocks. A jockstrap consists of a waistband (usually [[elastomer|elastic]]) with a support pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed to the base of the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What’s the difference between a jockstrap, thong and g-string?|url=http://www.vocla.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-jockstrap-thong-and-g-string/|website=VOCLA Style|access-date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pouch, in some varieties, may be fitted with a pocket to hold an impact resistant cup to protect the [[testicle]]s and/or the [[penis]] from [[injury]].

==== Dance belt ====
{{Main|Dance belt}}

A dance belt is a type of thong designed to be used in the same manner as an athletic supporter, but for male dancers (especially in ballet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancebelt.info/17165091C1D94631B10E/the-complete-guide-to-dance.html |title=Complete guide to dance belt |publisher=Dancebelt.info |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to protect and support the dancer during dance activities without being seen through outer garments, such as [[tights]], [[leotard]], gym leggings or shorts. Thongs tend to offer better support for the male anatomy than do other underwear styles (as well as eliminating contact between the genitals and inner thighs) and is one of the reasons why men and boys may choose to wear them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.byui.edu/dance/policies |title=Studio Area Dress Codes |publisher=Beta.byui.edu |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
{{Main|Social impact of thong underwear|Underwear as outerwear}}
As thongs pass between the buttocks and, in women, may be in close contact with the anus and labia, concerns have been raised that they may become damp and act as a conduit for germ transfer, increasing the probability that the wearer may develop urinary tract infections, such as cystitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/thongs-do-they-cause-utis-or-yeast-infections |title=Thongs — Do they cause UTIs or yeast infections? &amp;#124; Go Ask Alice! |publisher=Goaskalice.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbookmag.com/health-wellness/advice/gyno-questions-yl-3|title=Your Intimate Gyno Questions Answered|author=Karen J.

Of particular controversy is the retail by several outlets, including [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]], and [[Etam UK|Etam]], of thongs for children as young as seven, due to their previous association with nude or erotic dancers. This controversy spawned a great deal of free publicity for Abercrombie, including a chain letter that received wide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/aandf.html |title=Break the Chain website |publisher=Breakthechain.org |date=6 June 2002 |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208065730/http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/aandf.html |archivedate=8 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media attention was drawn to the phenomenon when a British primary [[head teacher]] voiced concerns that [[student|pupils]] as young as 10 were wearing thong underwear to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2943874.stm |title=Bbc (Uk) |publisher=BBC News |date=28 May 2003 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USA Footvolley''' is the national [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for [[Footvolley]] in the [[United States]]. It is in charge of selecting the United States Footvolley team and any other teams which officially represent the United States, as well as the overall organization and operation of the sport within the country, in accordance with the Amateur Sports Act. The national headquarters is located in [[Sunny Isles Beach]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name='WOODS'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-143726711/footvolley-hot-sport-south.html |title=Footvolley hot sport in South Beach: |accessdate=2010-01-29 |last=Woods |first=Casey |date=March 27, 2006 |work=[[Miami Herald]] |publisher=Miami Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Footvolley’s popularity taking off in South Florida|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/health-fitness/article51001670.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965&lt;ref name='PVTLN'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footvolley.net/news.php?nsid=17 |title=Birthplace of Footvolley to Host Olympic Games! |accessdate=2010-01-29 |work=Pro Footvolley Tour, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana Beach]]. The game of footvolley - first called 'pevoley', literally meaning "footvolley", that was discarded for "futevôlei". Footvolley started in Rio de Janeiro; however cities like [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brasília]], [[Goiânia]], [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] and [[Florianópolis]] have players who have been playing footvolley since the 1970s.

Teams of footvolley had five a side at first. Due to the skill level of the footvolley athletes (nearly all were professional football players), the ball would rarely drop. The players began lowering the number of players on each side, eventually settling on 2 versus 2, which is still in use today.&lt;ref name='FVBRH'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html |title=Futevolei Historia |accessdate=2010-01-29 |work=Futevolei.com.br }} ''[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html&amp;ei=9zljS9ukC4eXtgepss24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBAQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG%26num%3D50 English translation]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first International Footvolley event to occur outside of Brazil was in 2003 by the United States Footvolley Association on Miami Beach at the 2003 Fitness Festival.
Brazilian athletes: Wellington Correa 'Helinho' and Renan were the Champions of the competition; but the sport gained steam for international development.

In 2016, the City of Sunny Isles Beach, FL provided USA Footvolley its Official Training Centre. Here is where the National Team trains.

==Organizational structure==
There are several parts and levels that make up USA Footvolley. There is the National governing body (national) level, the Zone (regional) level, and the Local Footvolley Committee (local/state) level.

===Pro Footvolley Tour rules===
The rules in the [[United States]] professional tour [[Pro Footvolley Tour]] are designed to make the matches faster and more aggressive. Some of the notable differences are: net height of 2.10 Meters; 2-pointers are awarded up to 3-times maximum per set for all shots scored with the foot when one foot goes above the head when striking the ball and the other foot is off the ground (bikes, matrix kicks, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pro Footvolley Tour |url=http://wlrn.org/post/shark-attack-beach-footvolleys-popularity-taking-florida-us// |publisher=[[wlrn]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro Footvolley Tour airs on Root Sports, Comcast SportsNet, Time Warner SportsChannel, Bright House Networks, WapaDeportes, and CaribVision.  Through DirecTV Pro Footvolley Tour can be seen in the entire United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Explore DirectTV |url=https://www.directv.com/tv/Pro-Footvolley-Tour-c01jckE2UEpKYms9/Episode-UW5ZWjRPRVVvQkhRZzFtanlJaWJPZz09 |publisher=[[DirectTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comcast |url=http://corporate.comcast.com/images/sportsnet-houston1.pdf |publisher=[[Comcast NBC Universal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Championship/US Open===
The National Championship is exactly what the name implies.  There is only 1 National Championship meet at the conclusion of each season across the country. The National Championships are also of the invitational meet format and offer extremely high level competition.  Only a very small percentage of people who ever play footvolley will make it to this high a level of competition. This meet is generally used to determine the US National Team for various international level meets each year, but is not used to determine the US Olympic Team.

===US Olympic Trials===
The United States Olympic Trials will be held for the first time on June 25 in [[Seaside, Oregon]]. This event will be held  once every 4 years. Since this meet offers such a coveted prize (a spot on the US Olympic Team) for the 2016 Rio Olympics exhibition tournament. United States citizenship is required to compete at this meet since only United States citizens are allowed to represent the United States at the Olympics. The Olympic Trials are also under unique requirements made by the [[United States Footvolley Association|USFA]].

Trials meets are also held for the World Championships and World University Games, typically at a national championship meet.
